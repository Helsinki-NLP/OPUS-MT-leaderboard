Barack Obama gets as the fourth American President of Nobel Peace Price
The American President Barack Obama will come to Norwegian Osla for 26 hours in order to take Nobel's peace price here as the fourth American president in history.
The diploma, medails and a check of 1.4 million dollars will be obtained outside the exceptional efforts to strengthen the world's diplomacy and cooperation among the nations.
The white house boss will come to Norwegian metropoleo with Michelle's wife and will be stuck.
First of all, the Nobel Institute, where the first meeting is with the five members of the committee who chose him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The president couple has a planned meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonjo.
On the afternoon, the visit will give up the celebration ceremonies to which Obama will carry out a prestigious assessment.
He's getting him as the fourth American President, but the third one who's getting the price directly in the office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan war when the assessment is overtaken.
The President does not want to avoid this subject because he realizes that he is a president who currently wars in two countries.
War effort has yet increased by sending other units to Afghanistan a few days ago, which will not forget to highlight any of his critics.
At Obama's ceremonie, it will also receive the golden medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
You're going to give good-doers, but he's not decided about a particular charity yet.
The purchased programme of the president will then lead to the banket, where it will also be the President of the Norwegian King and the Queen of the Minister and 250 other invited guests.
Both was more sustainable from the beginning to the price.
For example, he pointed out that he feels that he doesn't deserve it fully.
Sometimes he also repeated that it is not just a price for it, but for everyone who seeks the same value as he.
Ihned, after the notification, pointed out that it was "a call for action".
Natural Protector accused of exhibition
The Litomaric police accused the President of the Civil Association of Protectors of Nature Litomarice from the exhibition.
In some cases in the past year, he called to some building management, requested money from investors for its benefits, said Litomaric police speaker Alena Romova.
The president of the Litomaric Communities of Nature Protectors is Lubomir Studnik.
He's now in the connection, and he's threatening him until three years of departure.
The third containers of Brnu are not too busy
In Prague, usual people can class the beverages of drinks, and you will meet the classic containers on each step in the southern villages.
And in Brna?
There you can win a few minutes before you find the suitable bathroom.
I don't want to claim that he wouldn't have a waste in Brna at all.
But I think we are the other largest city in the Republic, the advisers are insufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest classing of waste not only because, as citizens here, we can still hold only paper, glass and plastic, but mainly the number of bathrooms for such waste.
Have you ever tried to throw PET laughs into the collection waste?
It's a fingerprint, mainly it wants time and strong nerves.
The only place I've been on, is on Mooie's place in the opposite of the Poõene Huse.
Maybe Mr. Underka doesn't hurt me with my colleague, but it's gonna come to me a little bit.
Don't talk about that, even in other parts, there is no weed classing.
A number of my friends do not classify ra'i.
It's nice.
That's what they have to do to the towns far away.
I'm not surprising them.
I offered myself after the celebration to throw out a couple of glass and plastic sticks.
But in the Counic Street, I haven't seen any colored boxes in the survey.
Fortunately, I went to the right place.
However, waste waste waste waste.
Well, it's still the center of Brna, which may be the most representative of the city, isn't it?
But the ecological and ecological esthetics of armian socialists are not very interested.
These towns are buying a hoke extraligue, which will make us a conviction throughout the Republic before they buy a few containers further and offer the classing of other materials for the cleaner Brno.
I'm not that I could confirm my opinion after a moment of browsing on the Internet by the official.
According to the data of the EKO-COM company, the Brno is the worst in the south country.
"Paroubkov" budget took money for income and injury
After just added to the Government's opinion to agricultors or officers, it must not be in the budget for income, injury or building.
But also to taxes from State debt or to international court courts.
It will assign problems to those who will rule in the second half of the next year, says the Minister for Finance Eduard Janota.
When social democracy and communists promoted some groups, they emphasized that the government would grant additional contributions to emotional expenditure, income or injury. "This is just the solution of problems in the future, the min-placement," says Janota.
Of the loan money, it is to be paid as far as the higher rates are, and it must be returned sometimes.
It doesn't have enough to choose where to take it.
It does not decrease the social dose or costs of the State's road, it must take taxes.
All I'm just added to: to farmers, teachers, agricultors.
And after their kids.
Income or illness, from which 1,8 billion people have not needed to be afraid, they will be obtained.
However, for the price that it is more debt – the next year it will miss only 163 billion, but more.
Although I'm trying to make the Ministry of Janoty so much more than I'm going to do with him and the costs for rate.
State will need money for his refund and it will already be sufficient to increase the DPH in the steadfast and reduce the mother's way that the government did in its antideficit package.
For the purposes of the movement of money in the benefits of some groups of electors, five billion will also be missing for the delivery of remote and railways.
It is primarily deployed and deployed incidences that are not re-projected and, where appropriate, delighted.
The highest reservation, which isn't free.
This means the late or stop of thirty large buildings, which is also threatened to cover European money, warns the speaker of the Transport Minister of Karel Hanzelk.
The CSSD claimed that money would be solved by the Shelamounsky – the dividend of the CEZ, which has been owned, and the transport fund will be added.
The problem is that the top of dividends is never sure, and it is no longer a free source.
Loni joined 18 billion from the CEZ budget.
Ecological damage is applied each year from dividends, the revenue is added or served as a reserve for income reform.
Furthermore, this trick, according to the EU rules, increases the level of budget at 5.7 per cent of the BDP.
Yet, the carnival of movements will not end.
Three billion have been charged in the budget for a different damage by the victim of communism and criminal acts or on the expenditure of courts, even on construction.
If it's not sure without that money, it's not sure.
It's lottery.
If we lose a international dispute, we'll have to pay it the same, Janota states.
The Minister will then have to protect the money within the resort or in the worst case of the government budget reserve.
Hundred million are also missing a two billion project of the State stock that will enable online monitoring for which individual authorities are lost.
By the stage it starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance hadn't found money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, the sanctions will come, he warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
Americans in the future calculate the mobile phone on which the phone will be pressed by one button to switch between different operational systems.
The discovered plans sound promised.
It's enough to press one key and you'll be transferred to Android for a few seconds from Windows Mobile.
Exactly this option is demanded for the aim of the American VMware company, which is focused mainly on the development of computer analysis software.
We'll allow you to carry two profiles once.
You can switch between them, you can share them in home and work.
Both will work at the same time, Mr. Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in a chat for computer magazineworld.
He was pre-examinated in November of the year and was first predicted a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not a fixation.
VMware has already successfully introduced a smartphone test sample with two operating systems.
It was adjusted Nokia N800 with a RAM size of 128 MB, to which the Windows Mobile and Android systems were running around themselves.
The wave of the new mobile phone is in full run.
Now VMware is cooperating with European and American operators for the testing of smartphones and the customers should have devices during 2012.
The lack of snow on the mountains suffers hotels
Holy drivers don't care only for croconosian wallets.
The missing snow also reflects people from dealing with lyger residences in hotels and pensions.
That is why there are still free rooms in the Church for all the winter terms of Christmas and Silvestra.
We have a big visit on our pages.
People's offers, find prices, but yet they're scared to negotiate bindingly.
And if they call to us, they immediately ask if we think they'll be Christmas on the snow or on the black," said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants a silvestrov residence in Spindler Mountain exactly according to his imagination would have no longer weighted.
Whoever gives the priority for money and the quality of the apartment is u\t to the other place, it can still try to wait for a few days.
Spindler's hotels are still offered to Silvestra mostly weekly residences.
I think they'll try to get them a little while, but then they'll let them go and go for a shorter time.
And then the rooms will be free to live," Jandura recalled.
The free bed in all winter terms still offers the top-lab road. Ingtours office.
Now we're most interested in a breakfast week that has not been sold yet.
A half of the places in our offer are still free.
That is why we've already made the most fairest birthday residences for the last moment," said Director Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
Silvester in the Krkonosh may offer the highway too, but free places are less.
It's good for the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter terms are selling directly.
This year, the interest of the cold residence affects negatively the fact that there is still no snow in the Croatian.
People's waiting if he attacks.
No one wants to take the end of the year on the mountains without snow.
They will be snipped in the week, and they will be sold by Christmas," Mr. Schiefert.
On the contrary, something better than the winds can be included in the Horizont hotel rooms in Peci under Snow.
We're about five percent better on that.
We have the last few places at Silvester and Christmas.
The big interest is on Poland's vacuums in January and is also sold on February," told the director of the best peck hotel of Karel Rada.
From 80 percent, silvestrov residences are also located in Omnia at the central parking hotel in Janské Lázň.
On the contrary, on Wednesday, the latest January hotel remains a half of the beds of free.
It's a pleasure to surprise us this year's ice, which we've already been occupied of about sixty percent at this moment.
It's a little weaker on February yet, but as soon as the snow attacks, the interests of the living in the Croatia certainly still stands, the director introduced Omnia Erik Sporysch Hotel.
However, on the more snow end, croconous hotels have to have to be stumbled at the same time.
On Thursday, if there are snows, there should be snows on the mountains.
But then he has to return to the heat, informed Jür Jacobski from the cheese hydrometheorological constitution.
United States: Repeat is a mother of wisdom
It's comic, with Barack Obama's school effort, the President with the most discreet speech, repeat in the Afghanistan question of his pre-committee strategy, which he himself used to be the most stupid.
When he finally exhausted his identical expected afghanistan doctor, it was shown that he had a copy of the Iraq scenario of Bush three years ago.
Not only in the same text, he used the wording "as in Iraq", but he did not even weigh using the name of Bush's declaration from January 2007 as the name of his own ability: "New road forward".
Instead, he himself criticized Bush's idea three years ago to send fresh military positions to Iraq by the civil war as "unresponsibility and in his following disaster decisions".
The next months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which exciting from the recommendation of the field commanders, was my only and so successful that today, in the reporting reports on Iraq, it wasn't talking anyway.
The Bush's reputation did not increase, but objectively left his representative much more grateful outcome than it could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle is again.
To increase the military contingent, he was requested by the leaders of the field, especially by the general of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even, despite the subordinational growth, hardly criticized the weighty shooter in the White House.
He asked for 40 thousand men to break a break to the best.
The president was weakening three months, but he didn't make anything better, and then, at least, he struck the General about 10 thousand soldiers.
In Europe, he was able to fulfil the promises of five thousand others, even though he himself was counting at least 10.
The most difficult in the Obama Strategy seems to be his intention to begin downloading army from Afghanistan for 18 months and finish this process within three years. The whole Obam's doctor calls for more questions than answers.
Many doubt that half-increased increase gives the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the brotherhood war last years, the Iraq company has been relatively well arranged, her leaders honor the agreement.
Afghanistan is indicated as an opposite sign - no one can be contradicted and no agreements are complied with.
The Afghanistan security forces are wrongly prepared for these submines, usually to change the gentlemen every day according to what they do.
Political institutions, even if they are formally founded, will remain only a polycarbon village for which patriarchal relations will continue to be built.
The interests of different ethnic groups are increasingly complex in view of the independence of the circumstances that are more complicated by the Pakistan and Iranian influences.
Not even the building of a "accessful State", which is the minimum objective of the whole operation, does not seem too real.
The time horizon of Obam's strategy will hurt his voluntary.
In the past eight years, the explosion in Afghanistan was only worrying, and now it's on the explosion.
Trusting that the soldiers who send to the war in front of the "fast return to home" cause a miracle here, can only be romantic, unconcerned soul.
In the political way, the date of the station of armies is a clear independence, because the Taliban will be worth it as an indirect recognition of American violations.
The final sum of NATO showed that the Europeans are willing to reach war operations in Afghanistan to a minimum.
The European policies do not fail nor want to explain to their electors how the safety of Germany or Italy relates to war in Hinducuche.
Another factor that is able radically to enlarge into the construction is the development of an adversity around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions on Iraq are not affected, the issue will be raised before the United States, whether they will not try to solve the problem with military force.
It will be necessary to answer it just at the time, according to Obama, to the winning download from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will also mean dramatic turnover in Afghanistan.
The only payment for Barack Obama is that for three years the presidential elections will remain, and thus there is still enough time to come with further strategies if this is shown as a total degree.
Goldman Sachs Bank managers will no longer be rewarded in preparation
High Chief Works of the United States Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the year's payment in preparation.
She told this company that so reacts to the island of the criticism of her wage practices.
The group of 30 primary managers will receive the money of an action which will be sold first in five years.
Actions may also be rejected to the managers if they are too risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the agency Rerês, is in the head of an attempt to connect a recompense on Wall Street with the performance.
I believe that Wall Street is a good way of the larger direction to issue, the former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott has introduced.
The problem is in details, he added.
Bank Goldman Sachs became critical after the first three quarter of the year gave it to the side at $17 billion (this is $3 billion billion billion).
The total payment in the company for an annual year according to the Agency Re·s, obviously, exceeds 20 billion dollars, despite the currently reported measure.
High recompenses in the banking sector have become a political issue in a number of countries with the financial crisis.
In the middle of British stated that the deep bonuses of bankers exceeding 25,000 pounds (subsection 712,000 Kč) once charged 50 per cent taxes.
He's also prepared for France at the spectacular steps.
This year women obtained Nobel's price in all areas other than physics
The five records of women today in Stockholm have been taken from the hand of the King of Sweden Carla XVI. Gustafa the annual Nobel prices in professional categories and forwards.
Nearly four and four of them was a German writer of the Romanian potter Herta Mıer.
The Nobel Price for Medicinal Products received two American biologs Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider together with their national Jack Schostak for research in Chromosomes.
The price for chemicals was received by the Israelian Ada Jonath together with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitzem for the interpretation of the structure and the ribosomes.
The final laureat had Nobel's price for the economy obtained by the American Elinor Ostrom and her country Oliver Williamson for an analysis of the economic governance.
The only professional category that went out without a holder this year was physics.
Today, this price has been taken by Charles Kao members for research in optical flames and George ́ith with Willard Boyle for finding CCD chip, which is based on all digital cameras, faxs or astronomical remote views.
Each evaluated adopted a diploma, Nobel medal and a certificate on the profit of the financial remuneration.
This category reaches ten million Swedish crowns (25 million Kč) in each category.
They are more than each of them, they divide their rewards.
Traditionally unexpected Nobel's peace price has already received this afternoon in Norwegian Assembly President Barack Obama.
In his manifestation, he recognized the contradiction of his assessment, because he was just at the beginning of his roads and also stands at the head of the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, he added to his policy that wars are in certain ways necessary for the elimination of peace, even though the price for it is high.
Mr. Janota's demise, and Klaus invited him to the Hrad
President Václav Klaus will accept on Friday the Ministry of Finance of Eduard Janot, which considers the detention in the government, because it does not agree with the likeness of the state budget for the next year as the Missionary draft has approved it in the centre.
It is assumed that the budget and may also Janot's holding in the cabinet will be the subject of their Friday meetings.
The beginning also criticizes Klaus.
Accordingly, it has too high deficit, which continues to cover public funding crisis.
He informed the president's meeting of the speaker Radim Ogvat.
Janota wants to act on Monday with Prime Minister Jane Fischer.
According to the budget law which Klaus now gets to sign, the Czech Republic should economy with 163 billion crowns.
However, in the middle of the middle, it agreed only to the transfer of money and increased money for the payment of public employees, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government expressed social democracy's advice that they had a budgetary step.
In the middle of the left and government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, there was a deep internal dispute that caused the question of the next action of the Fischer's Official Cabinet, which agreed to the ODS, the CSD and the Green Party.
Criticals claim that the budget as adopted by a consent, in principle, eliminates the package of susceptible measures that the Government of Fischer has sentenced on the subsequent basis and has to stop the debt of the State.
Klaus, who can, but also does not have to sign the State budget law, on today's debate dinners with undertakers, declared that political policies had lacked a "severe problem", which is "unsustainable deficiency" of public funds.
Today there's no good solution.
Enhancement could only bring a strong government, which could, in addition, address a widelier consensus of political parties, to the President.
The President of ODS Mirek Topolánek stated that the budget was terrible and that the government should consider further existences.
Vice-President ODS Petr sometimes said that the concept of the Official Cabinet with the support of CSSD, ODS and Green does not appear to work.
Prime Minister Fischer, in response, marked similar words for "forced expressions".
Chief CSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolanka as a fearful step of the budget that the former Topolankov government prepared for this year and exceeded 200 billion crowns.
In the middle of the CSSD, the State budget approved for the next year for success.
The people were also happy.
You played Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's newspaper.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The unexplained will speak to the world a lot about the land, its fights and victories despite some critics that the main role of the American herds is.
The story reports about sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandel.
The unnamed fight against the racial regime of the apartheid in the South African Republic and its first black president Nelson Mandel in his life story represents the Oscar American Herc Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said the 11-year Mandela asked him if he could create him in Eastwood's movie.
Other important role in it plays Matt Damon.
I said to him, 'When I play you, I will have to have access to you.
The twenty-seventy-year-old heric, who received the price for the role in Eastwood's drama from the box Million’s Baby, has already created a leader who moves for the destruction of slavery, from which, finally, became a slave, a fiktiv president of the United States and even a god in God’s Evano, but only rarely one who lives and is so important for many people as Mandela.
An ancient South African Stateman was 27 years in practice for his active work for the end of the apartment in South Africa.
He was released to freedom in 1990 and then became the president of the country for four years.
In 1993 Nobel's price for peace was designated.
Invictus is the Latin word for unexpected and is the name of the basic English author of William Ernesta Henley issued in 1875.
The call was to talk like him.
The picture is a real story of how Nelson Mandela connected the forces of the South African Ragby Team of Francois Pinaire to help join the country. The newly chosen president Mandela knows that his nation remains racial and economically divided after the apartment.
They believe that their people can join through sport, so they will decide to join the players of rags that belong to a worldwide measure between outsides.
The South African Team will finally go to the World Country of 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to get Mandel's story on the plate.
I had no other goal than to play this role so that I could draw closer to her as most real, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to talk like him.
Heric said that if he and the world policies were from the same nature, he would try to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be in prison before his statement.
It was the most important thing that Mandel wanted to cut off his hand.
I found out that when I print your hand, I'm taking your energy, it's transferring, and I felt that I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to get with another person.
Matt Damon creates Françoise Pinaire's film, a national ragby team in which white players were transferred.
Heric said he had six months to prepare for a role in the strong world of ragby.
The great surprise for the end was when he first met Pinner in his house.
I'm thinking, as I called the house, he opened me, and the first thing I said to François Pinaire in my life was, "I look much more in the movie."
Despite clear divisions in hercer positions in comparison with their proposals under the governance of the Registry Eastwood, Invictus received: The unusual positive recessions and also talks about ambitions in Oscar.
The film criticism of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy broke his evaluation in words: "It was a very good story, a very good film."
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com sites, Invictus received 76 percent of positive evaluations.
Secret of Sea over Norway resolved: The Russians tested the racket
On Norway, it was possible to observe the special light effect of an unknown pump.
The Russian Defence Ministry admitted yesterday that near Norwegian borders tested the intercontinental ballistic racket.
But the start was again unable and the shooter marked as the type "Bulava", which was supposed to be a polythetic chloud of Russian army, becomes slowly the black sea of Russian generals and the Prime Minister Vladimir Putina.
Not even his repeated presence in the racket tests had an efficacy effect on the success of the tests.
The bulava wasn't hurt or hurt in the air.
In Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is already written as "rackets that are not flying."
A racket that's not flying but lighting
The 13th trial has already been started normally in order.
In the end of the flight, the technical damage of the apparatus returned to the end of the flight.
Apparently the engine exploded in the third degree of rackets.
This time, "Bulava" started from the atmosphere of Dmitry Donski, which flies under the White Sea level.
This type of racket allows the shooting from the ship that is in movement and at the same time defrauded.
It is therefore likely that the mystery light caused by Norway closer to the undetermined flying object was corrupted by "Bulava".
The rest of the Norths have not doubted about the Russian racket since the first time.
Generals are being prevented and claimed that they can't speak unlikely about failure.
Two degrees of rackets have been held and the accident has reached up to the third.
In the previous cases, engines were disturbed immediately in the first degree.
Although no test start has been completely missing, only six of the thirteen will have a failure to lead the Defense Minister.
Thus, nearly 50 percent success of the general is filled with optimism and thus still claims that "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even carry up ten hypersensitive nuclear blocks with the maximum total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed in 51 years of a year with CSKA Moskva
The Legendary Defensor Vjačeslav Fetisov will be represented again in the 51 years of professional hoke.
The former world master, the Olympical winner and the holder Stanley Cupu will help in the trouble of his CSKA Moskva team and apparently replaces KHL against Petrohrada on Friday.
Fetis, who ended the career in 40 years in 1998, is currently the President of CSKA.
After Dannis Kuljash was hurt, we need to make another defendant.
Fetis regularly trained and agreed to help the team.
We just need to resolve the formal events that the AP Agency has sensed the Moscow Club Sergei Germany.
There's no way if comeback of the famous hokehist will only affect one storage.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lead the spirit of the final players, he introduced the Germans.
So, according to the AP, Fetisov becomes the oldest Russian professional hokeist.
In NHL, he played the whole season for Hartford, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe, and approved 15 and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hokeists of history.
In the Road of the Soviet Union, he received two olympics gold, seven titles of the world's master, triumphed on the Cup Canada and the Youth World Shampionat.
In the second part of his career, he also collected success in NHL, where he lifted up Stanley Cup in the Detroitu dress twice.
Since 2001, the Hokee Sina of glory is a member.
Hyundai's officers. He's cancelling all the time.
The driving of the Hyundai car agreed with the committees to cancel all overtimes.
Just because of the often scheduled overtimes, the committees have declared the preparation of the staff on Monday.
He confirmed that Hyundai Peter Vanek's speaker car.
However, the leadership wants to agree with the experts on another annual Sabbath change.
We can't reject our production plan, it's essential, therefore it was proposed a volunteer at the same time on Saturday 19, by making two changes, said Vanique.
Server Seven.cz wrote that the company of employees who work Sabbath exchange offered bonus 400 Kč.
This people will get back for the work on November 28th.
According to Vanica, the company decided to change the way of motivating employees for a timely proposed.
Or let them pay a payment for overtime or they can choose a replacement free of 28.
Furthermore, all employees of the Sabbath exchange will receive payable holidays and dinners.
In view of the most urgent and inflammable point of view of the workers and the protesting employees, which have stopped the production last week, the leadership of the afternoon decided on the immediate basis of the cancellation of all transitional periods for the month's month, Vanek said.
Car employees were required practically every day after eight-hour exchange to work a long time of two-hour period.
After the signature of the agreement, the committee shall revoke the staff facility
Next negotiation between car and professionals shall be successful on Wednesday afternoon.
The Boss of the Committees Peter Kuchař in the middle said that if they agree to comply with the requests and sign the common document, they are prepared to cancel the staff capacity.
The situation in the car was discontinued last week in the middle of approximately 400 employees spontaneously due to inconsistent transitions.
They also protested against bad payment and data shickens.
The leader insisted that the employees should do at the time for compliance with car supply requirements.
Professors in their Monday statement requested also that the staff would not be acquired by any sanctions by employees who stopped the production by the past center.
In the past of the time, the committee by the company requests to take a minimum time job.
Moreover, they want to pay a 5000 crown in the year.
Hyundai's car is now employing 2000 people.
With the same production, the company split down in November.
In the season, it made approximately 80,000 cars, and its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Revelation: Substance that also takes HIV's 'free' virus
The Czech and German team tests new associations that can slow HIV virus spread in the body.
Clause of the advantage of the improved substance is that it also takes viruses that have already been obtained against immune medicinal products.
This fact, in some cases, is overwhelming that the association with the virus variant does not act as strong as some of the treatment already available.
AIDS disease cannot be treated yet.
However, patients may prolong the lives of a mixture of medicines that prevent HIV in the body.
Their use, however, takes place a number of advanced agents.
Furthermore, incomplete polygamity of virus is the result of the development of resistent viruses, against which the medicines are already ineffective.
The work of experts from the three Academia’d ČR institutions, from the VHCHT Praha and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to arrange the virus resistance.
They showed that the substances called metacarbonate affect the protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV virus.
Metacarboranas are associated with bovine, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These associations block the spread of virus other than all the medicines used today, and therefore they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, the employees are joined with new 'bettered' associations prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their links to viral protein.
Metacarbonates have a single three-dimensional structure: two multi-sized cells of atomos of bar, hydrocarbon and carbon are connected with the metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Training and disturbing virus
HIV protease is a HIV virus protease, which is necessary for life cycle.
Without HIV protease of HIV-virus inflammation, it would not reduce adult infectional particulate.
When we stop HIV protease, we will also stop the spread of virus in the patient body, they explain in the print report issued by the Constitution of organic chemicals and biochemies Academy'd CR.
In the work published in the magazine Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, they describe a series of associations in which two pairs of clothes (see table) are connected to a short organic string that is further systematicly modified.
About something worse, but more complex
The effect of this series of anti-HIV protease substances was tested in the scrupules and also in the opposite (resistance) variants obtained from HIV virus patients.
The effect of metacarbonates on the enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, but their non-effective effect on resistant variants on which the medicines are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of the mechanism and their other characteristics such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical adjustments both from metal carboanas makes interesting associations for further research relating to the admission of HIV drugs, Pavlína Manager, structural biological laboratory of organic chemical and biochemic constitution and the Constitution of the molecular genetic Academy.
The ODS left to Fischer, he's preventing.
Boss ODS Mirek Topolánek marked an approved budget for the next year for "terrible" and the Government of Prime Minister Jana Fischer should consider further existence.
The ODS exposure signed the president of the Government for strong announcements.
He's keeping his analysis sometimes.
Vice-President ODS Peter sometimes said that the concept of the Official Cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Parties is no longer functioning.
The president of the Government, according to the time, must decide whether it is decided to deal with the minority of growing deficit, whether it is to remain inside Parliament only.
The access to the ODS and social democracy to the problem of public deficits is diameterly different, noted sometimes.
In the middle of the average, it adopted the budget for 2010, but with the left-hand changes for more than 12 billion crowns.
It increased the money for the payment of the national employees, the operation of social services and the direct payment of agricultors.
The Great Government in the address of the social democracy was, however, that they visited the steps of the budget.
The HR should economy with 163 billion crowns.
The ODS went out of the hall before the vote, claimed that the Government's desire that even the changed budget was less wrong than the budgetary provision.
Disappointment and martyrship
The Minister for Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feeling of deceit, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the Government of the current evaluation was still valid.
Sometimes it is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened the decline from the event of adoption of changed opinions, it could seem different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota was charged on Monday after the government to the Prime Minister.
Instead, he pointed out that he considers the next preservation in Âia.
D'em is his disappointment of the budget negotiations.
Fischer is expressed for the further fight against budgetary stages, they do not, in some cases, in the Government, what to do the nominators of the CSSD, who have condemned the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say that it gives demises if the deficiency accepts further deficit laws, such as those relating to disease, income, or new service law.
Topeloon: ODS nomination ministries haven't been dismissed
This is the case of the Minister of Fischer and the entire government.
The Deputy Ministers did not do anything wrong, highlighted Topolanek in the United States text report.
He recalled that several ministerial offices were reporting to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
He emphasized sometimes that if Fischer decides to reject the principle of fighting with a higher level of public financing, "the is absolutely logical and correct that it is based on the left-hand level that is currently in sleeping."
Then he can't count with the support and tolerance of civil democracy.
I didn't think about it, and when it's current, I'll refuse it, he said to the journalists in the prominent defense minister of Martin Barták, who was just appointed by civil democracy in the government.
Prime Minister Fischer went on afternoon to the European Council's negotiations to Brussels.
Premier ODS demanded
At the same time, he stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the modified budget in the middle of the middle of the budget if the Prime Minister of Civil Democrats would not expressly ask for the adoption of the budget.
We don't seem to be poor, we're not small children, but he answered the question whether the ODS, during the political negotiations on the budget, did not affect the presence of the President of the Party in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice my voice was missing.
Since I had delivered my mandate, I realized that in the next months, it would be about the bombing of the sniffling and the destruction of all positive things, he reacted to Topolanek himself.

Philippines' weapons still hold more than 50 people, children left free
Today, arms in the south of Philippines have born 75 people, mostly, a number of basic scholars and their teachers.
It was introduced by the AFP Agency, which was only informed of 65 persons.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours by one factor.

But on Wednesday, they restored peace talks with the Philippines government.
The JAR story relates to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next days, the new Hollywood movie Clinta Eastwooda Invictus comes to the American cinema (official name in Czechish is Invictus: Incorporated), who catchs part of the life story of the former president of the South African Republic of Nelson Mandely.
The role of a worldwide fight against the apartment was located by Morgan Freeman, who himself chose Mandel for his creation years ago.
The first man's role of the Legendary South African champion in the Francoise Pinaire's rugby was deceived by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the photo into the film, it is exhibited from the voices of critics and publics
Nelson Mandela
The whole named Nelson Rolihla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in South Africa.
In 1988 he received Sachar's price for the freedom of thinking, and in 1993 with de Klerke Nobel's peace price.
The president of the South African Republic was 1994-1999.
a great expectation, because it comes to the public at the time when the South African Republic, however, brings up preparations for the world championat in the Balaam, but the media also spread anxiety reports on the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the people from the Black Government.
According to the reporting agency AP, a new movie in JAR is to move throughout the universe, even through a fair exemption against the occupation of the main roles by the Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is proud according to his words for a new movie.
I dreamed about that role for a long time and was well prepared for it.
For many times, I also met Nelson Mandela personally so that, as it is said, I've kept his energy, he's introduced in a conversation after the festival Prime Minister of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandel's personality and message with the movie.
It's the story of the South African Republic, but it's about everyone, added.
In the dress of a national security team
The picture based on the CN presentation of the British writer John Carlina with a freely translated name In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that she had given to appear to the nation are portraiting the South African human rights station during his first presidential election period.
Thus, during the movie, Morgan Freeman is trying to smile two races and after a long time a group of populations, as well as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he also enters in heric role in the southern African national rugby dress on the crossing of the world fire that JAR wins.
For the entrance in the treasure, which is understandable in JAR as so holy, Mandela flipped a large sheep over 14 years ago, mostly in the white public, and obtained recognition of the white people.
Football campaigns may be able to reconnect people to one nation, introduced a rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in 1995 in the national team.
If the pick-up in JAR is improved, it will only be shown.
However, the white South Africans are skeptics, as for example, in a recent conversation for the LN, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to British.
Championate shall be held on 11 June 2010.
To Lounski Mountain transformator for tens of millions of crowns
The fire captured the Transformer of the Cheps company in divorce in the Village of Vüškov in Lounsko.
It contains six units in the fire, according to the speaker of the national guardians of Luke Marvan.
P'hazards wanted to let the transformator burn, but their view was overestimated and fire washing water mixtures, breasts and special hazards.
The cause was a technical complaint, the internal crash of the transformator.
No one was wounded, the hawair according to the speaker of Pavly Mandat does not threaten the safe transport system.
The damage is estimated for a few decades of million crowns, exactly calculating it until the fire is finished.
The destructed transformator will, according to the mandate, replace with a new.
In 10 years of operation of Cheps, there was nothing similar, the commitments of this type are unique, completed.
The supply of electric flow was not, according to the speaking company CHEZ for the North Czechland, Soni Holinger Hendrich's interrupts, the functioning of households, offices or fires of the trafostanic fire did not affect.
A.s. Cheps acts on the territory of Czechland as the exploitant of the transmission system, the electrical management of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 divorces with 67 transformators transfers electricity from transportation to distribution systems and roads at 4339 km long.
Janchura shall give a penalty notice for the negotiation of three heads of the CSSD
The student of the Agency Radim Jančur presents today a penalty notice for the discussion of three social-democracy leaders.
And it's on Michala Haška from the South Homo, Radko Martínka from the Pardubian country and the leader of the Olomouck country of Martin Tesaric.
Janchura put it into the radio journal for twenty minutes.
The complaint relates to the efforts of companies to operate regional road transport in some countries.
All the regions, however, finally signed with Czech loves.
All three captains are attacking us and talking about choosing divorces, and we offered the offer only for what they wanted.
It states we're dearer than the Czech roads, which is not true, because we know the prices of the Czech dragons that have been closed last week.
So we don't have to protect it.
It's for a conversation about the Student Agency, said to the Jančur Radio Journal.
In addition, he noted that he had evidence from all countries that they did not take their steps in accordance with European law.
It therefore prepares for the European Commission.
The chassing of the penalty notice considers further continued the medical show of Mr. Janchura, which serves him as an unpaid advertising of his company and his own persons.
I'm understandingly ready to get my good name and my country and to the same call and the final headmans.
I guess that even at this opportunity, Mr Jančur will show that it is exactly Mr Jančur who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments in the area of regional railway transport.
Janchura has announced that he has invested a number of million crowns in the advertising, which will warn about the unfair step of the countries.
The radio journal said that the campaign after Christmas would be interrupted and wanted to continue in it after the New Year.
He noted that the campaign would be led against corruption as such.
The campaign started Janchura after the country agreed on the operation of regional railway connections with the Czech Dears and on the prohibition of approximately 150 billion crowns had no tenders.
According to Janchura, it is similar to anti-legal acts and in contrast with the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
As a result of the criticism of the train transport in the countries of Janchuro, the lawyer also threatened the CSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't leave it, we can get a bus license.
He represented himself as a lawyer of the CSSD, I know what the lady is about, I won't say his name, he said to the Jančur Radio Journal today.
Waiting against pneumocs will be free and unfaithful
Expectation against pneumocs since January is deteriorated.
It must be the first for families free and equally unfaithful.
However, the vote has already responded that it would be obligation to wait more.
Preparations for the introduction of free expectation against pneumocs.
The medical establishment already defines the maximum vaccine prices paying health insurance.
Professors are also in the process of waiting.
New expectation
Free vacuums for abusive children
Since January, children who were born on August 2 and after may be freely distorted against pneumophotics.
The submin is that there is no expected dose yet.
Whoever starts to shoot the lone or before, he has to make another surprise.
The dose of expectation should be given between 3 and 5 months of child.
She voluntaryly let her children go against pneumocs.
At the same time, parents paid 1600 crowns for one dose and more.
In waiting for the youngest children, four doses are needed.
General experts consider that health insurance is issued at a dose of 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year.
But she's looking for the treatment that children would need without expectation.
Today, for all areas of expectation of children, he gave about 500 thousand per year.
The threatened expectation was carried out by the Janot Package.
Pneumokok causes middle ears disorders, but also serious infections of brain blends and blood disorders.
In the pneumokok infection we die in a year according to monitoring in illnesses up to 28 children to 10 years.
In addition to the Czech Republic, children’s flat expectations against pneumokocs in 40 countries have been carried out.
Will the waiting be obligation?
In addition, however, the views that this expectation could be binding in the future.
Since January, it must be covered by insurance and irregularity.
For example, the leader of the Civil Association of Nalas Rudolf Kalovski would have been obliged to wait better.
His association of pneumokok vaccine is promoting timely.
Professors of the International Association, which have been established, have not been completely satisfied with our voluntary expectations.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we believe that at least this was possible.
I think that's the way we have to stop now, Kalovski's introduced.
The Ministry of Health but the process of expectation against pneumocs does not want to change.
At this point, we don't think about it, said his speaker Vlastimil Srish.
Voluntary expectation has its outcomes, strong doctors
The Chairman of the Professional Society of Practical Child Medicines Han Cabrnoch recognises that he has a voluntary expectation of his failure.
If all children were disturbed, they could be considered to decrease the number of remarks "When this vaccine is so high, we are relatively understood by the political decision that the expectation was restarted as voluntary," however, Cabrnoch says.
Professors expect to let their kitchen go against pneumocs since the next year more than 80 percent of fresh parents.
The expectation against pneumocs is also ahead of the first flat expectation of children to build health security, not to stand.
Insurance should be spent for prevention, so that it takes another treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy the substances themselves.
However, it relates to the care of practical children’s doctors relating to vaccination.
According to the p-intention, vaccines had to buy insurance and the doctors would have received them similarly as state adds substances to final expectations.
But some lawyers feared that the assurances could "extract money from health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to purchase substances and wait until they are insured.
According to estimates, children’s individual practices will invest in a vaccine of 40 thousands per month, which is a significant amount.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
The son of the American Artist 's stealing in Museum'
The son of the renamed American fantastic creator Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to broke pictures of a value of $20 million (12 million) from his father's museum.
The police in Pennsylvania stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was accused of putting 90 images into his vehicle and carrying.
Mr. Frazetta and the other man used to join the museum in the region of Poconco Mountains.
Mr. Frazetta senior, age 81, celebrated the creation of Barbara Conan and Tarzana.
At the time that it happened, the artist was in Florida, as the printing agency introduced Press.
The AP sensed the most appointed police officer, who said that Mr. Frazetta younger could have been motivated to act by persisting family disputes.
Before the police, Mr. Frazett gave a younger swearing statement, 52 years old, that he did so to his father's instruction, "to get into museum in any way and move images into the sweet space," as the Agency said.
Mr. Frazetta senior demanded any authorisation as the Agency said.
Labouriste prevents the planned growth of taxes
The ministries deployed the growth of the tax and reduction of the expenditure notified in the preliminary report on the budget against the criticism of opposition, undertakings and committees.
As Alistair Darling said, Tory's "promarnilied" option to show that he thinks seriously determined to decrease deficit to the time after the elections.
Even the Officer has reached the fuel because of the low and medium-income rate of workers.
According to its opinion, the growth of 0.5 % in social insurance and 1 % in the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Discrimination regarding social insurance
The committees protested that workers with low income were deceived for the recession they did not blame and warned before "problems".
The social insurance increases - growth makes approximately 3 billion pounds per year - which encouraged the community of employees who have noticed that it is the tax of employment while it should be to re-economy.
This increase, limiting these incomes more than 20000 pounds per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
Key BODY PBR
Social insurance is increased by more than 0,5 % from April 2011
Economy is worse than expected, by 4.75 % in this year
New version of 50 % of bankers' bonuses
Increasing 1% fire tax for recepts in small fires
Decrease of taxes for electrical cars and electricity
Increasing income currency by 2,5 %
According to the estimate of the State financial administration, some incomes of 30000 litres are decreased by 90 litres per year and some income 40000 litres are decreased by 190 litres, while some income of 10000 litres increases by 110 litres.
The Ministers notified that their deficiency reduction goes to half until 2013 means "complicated decisions", but they continued that 60 % of special taxes should be 5 % of people with maximum income.
The Minister of Finance Stephen Timms emphasized that the increase in taxes and expenditure restrictions would be "cape in the ocean" compared to what it would be necessary.
"It's a big number. This will allow us to reduce deficit to half, which you're absolutely a basic requirement for the next four years," BBC told.
Mr. Timms stated that he is convinced that economic growth should be reached on an override of the year.
But the development of the prognoses for future economic growth - which will affect the amount of the necessary loans and how deficit will be decreased - must be broken up after the Office has been brought to the review of previous amounts.
In this year, the economic decrease was about 4.75% - far worse than the decrease of 3.5% in April - because the loans were three billion pounds higher than previously considered.
Foreground opportunity'
Conservatives who started a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning against the "debts crisis", marked the planned $789 billion for the next six years for an unfortunate.
The Ministers failed to present a pleasant plan, as it could be done, added, "chinetics" gave this decision to the time of the elections, which must be run by June 2010.
"They did not add anything important to be executable," said the County Minister of Finance Philip Hammond. "They had the possibility to do it, but they lost it."
"All important notices will be made after choices if we win them"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labouriste's market is that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from the future clusters to a distance from the Tory's people who want to decrease the deficit of more and more range.
But the liberal democracy claims that money obtained by increased taxation and reduction of expenditure should be used to support expenditure in the next year and not to reduce deficit, and arguing that the plans are "placed on sand".
The political commenter BBC Nick Robinson stated about the time of communication - for example, the inflation above will increase and will reach the failure of the dose payment in April next - that it could lead to the accusation of office in the election campaign, if money would have been hardly returned for a year after.
However, the market for special aid will be granted if people need it very much and the revision will be revised in September 2010.
Suspected budget
Although the ministers did not publish expenditure details after 2011, the economics claimed that the reduction of public expenditure would only be the beginning of the average limitations.
The recognised Institute of Budget Studies reported that the office numbers indicate significant clusters in many areas, potentially in the building include transport, high school and defence.
"It's still very painful," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important declarations will come after elections, if we win them," added Roger Bootle, the economic revisor of Deloitte revisors.
"It was a report of a suspicional preliminary budget, markets perform it."
The FBI's conducting research in the "American Republic of Pakistan"
The FBI's conducting an investigation in Pakistan at five Americans who are suspicious of extremists.
The men were arrested for an attack on the house in Sargoda in the East Panjab province, as the BBC announced to the American Majesty in Pakistan.
The FBI reported that it was an investigation of whether it was the same men who were announced as an unknown in the last month in their residence in Virginia.
The United States Ministry noted that it was also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them are stated that they are p'em from Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian forefathers and the final funerals from Jemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in what submins they were arrested and in what circumstances they stayed there," told speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI, Katherine Schweit, reported that the agency was informed about the prison and was in contact with the families of the wrong-doing students.
"We cooperate with the Pakistan authorities, and they determined their identity and respect for their behavior here and whether it's about sinful students," she said.
Pakistan's grandmothers in Washington found that men were arrested in a house of uncles of one of them.
The house was the middle of the local police's interest, and the case has not yet been charged against arrested men.
Mr. Hillry Clinton refused to comment on arrests, reported the printing agency Re日s, but said that the United States had to "cooperate a lot of areas with Afghanistan and Pakistan in the discovery of the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and training people".
The loss of these five students from the house in North Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Rejection of Amnesty for Iran Tirans.
The situation in the maintenance of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, as reported by the Amnesty International Group's report.
The report describes in detail the " torture methods" in the regime before and after the controverse presidential elections in June.
One of the men indicated that he was a bit and fired by cigarettes, and another pointed out that he was threatened by violence.
Iran has reacted to the above criticism of this report on the maintenance of human rights.
Officials marked this critical as a political motive.
In Iran, thousands of people were imprisoned and tens were killed after the contrary choice of President Mahmuda Ahmadinejadad, which led to the greatest street democracy from the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
The tens of them were rejected, and the complainants condemned the last five persons to death.
The BBC writer in Teheran John Leyne, now located in London, noted that the highest leader of the Ajatolahs Alali Chomejní first announced the inappropriacy of some ways of torture and prohibited their conduct in the corrigement of Karizak.
But since that time, no legal power criticism has been tolerated, as our writer said.
Injust recognition
Amnesty International felt a report of the 26-year-old student of the tech of Ibrahim Methari, which pointed out that he was accused of "working Facebook network" and protests against election outcomes.
"They were often in my face," he said in the responsibility.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my legs, on my head... they threatened me with the correction and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed the false recognition and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half in ignorance, Amnesty said.
In August, the President's candidate Mehdi Charroubi was arrested after the elections and was taught to die and the finals were violated.
The Iranian higher State officers rejected the accusation of violation, but they admitted that it was affected by torture.
Amnesty also indicated the case of an ancient case, which indicated that it was held in the container with 75 other persons for a period of more than eight weeks in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian Parliament and Justice had established committees for the investigation of authorised disasters and reactions of the government, but said that the mandate and powers of the authorities were unexpected and that the findings of the parliamentary committees were needed to be published.
The group noted that at least 90 persons were arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
In the town park, a lyxing swimming was created
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to change memory in Bristol to the leadership road.
The assembly road for the park was attached to 16 half-professional lingeries and snowboardists to competite on financial prices.
On the top of the River Road in the Brandon Hill Park, a short-scooking pool was 100 m ahead of the Chessar road.
The student of the fourth year of the medical doctor John Hickman said that it was a wonderful view from the top of the leadership, but that it was a pretty delicate.
It was a wonderful view of the licking lights of the city down.
There were some of the best liars and snowboardists throughout the country -- some of them are talents," he added.
The prices were made for the best bottles - or maneves on the leadership road.
After the quarter dinner travel, the snow was left to spread.
Keep them and me
Can I be a French Muslim?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secondary state.
In the time when the Swiss electors called after the prohibition of building mines and generally broadcasts about the data islamization of Europe, John Bowen, the American Academy wrote and informed and thought of whether the Muslims could integrate - and whether they are integrated - to one of the most uninterpretated secular companies of the continent.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became the surprises of the authors of the last work, "Why do the French have no heads" (2006), this elegant and discussed study on the difficult issues that they share and employ the country for 15 years and whose effects are still feeling today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen has a broader and more ambitional conclusion.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to do not only what politicians and media have said about islam in France, but what has happened on the basis.
He spent all months in mixtures, schools and institutions, which are now concerned about 5 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He's a good listener, plays debates between teachers and students about questions that are most concerned.
Should I have to enter in a woman's bond in a mix or in a workshop (or in both places)?
Should the young Muslim be learned about the development and gay rights?
Can the Muslim be a man who isn't Muslim?
Does Muslim have the right to use an interestingly oriented bank system to get a hypotech?
These are, probably, worldly conflicting issues which are discussed and which are part of everyday life more than the political drama that works with media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other generally known persons, without exception of Tarika Ramadana, Arabia, Muslim researcher and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation will try to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in the modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are uncertain to the French or European Islamic idea.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen has interviewed are attached to the domain that this is the anti-selephis of the purists of Sunni Islam, associated in Saudi Arabia - this group is small, but affects the European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
The question is how far the French politicians (and the intellectual elite that thus arrputates the latch public) are given the ideas of pluralism.
It is that the Muslims have probably less experience in the issues of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to do historical compromises with the secondary Republic.
More than the pragmatism development tried to "reduce values".
After reading this book, someone may have the inclination to say, "Yes, but not now."
The most uncomfortable views of the world
Arktis changes more dramaticly than the end of the planet's life.
About the ice covers alarming, which affects animals and their survivals as nowhere else.
The interests of the economies, gaseous and fisheries companies must be focused on new natural water resources, together with diplomates, lawyers and writers in their waking.
Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, contains the natural history of the North icon, the polar medium.
It is well known with complex history and whale-fishing procedures that describes the tradition of polar investigators who have tried to strengthen the white bear.
Meeting Nelson's ad ́s with a courageous fourteen-year-old boat, who fought only with the cold of the muschet is mytus, but all the rest is true.
Young beverages who flew for their bodies just killed mothers were arrested and sent to zoo and circus.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar mediums came up once in a circus station.
Even today the zoo has a typical surface million times less than it is that it has one adult in the divorce. Climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis is a part of the final writers and historians, and often turns back to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although the jail is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where the helicopter and the Indians are hunted on the floor, and all are armed by the executive attacking hands that strike their profit.
Ironically, it is that it is playing in the water north of these two captives of the nations and the ice will finally be the greatest.
In his new book "Po ice" Alun Anderson, former New Scientist editor, offers an responsibility for the Arctic and an appealing view of how it can change the future.
Not on all the answers.
Neither ororologists and oceanographics have adequate response to changes.
It's for a lack of tests.
At the end of 19th and beginning of the 20th century, Fridtjof Nansena's research travels indicated how the ice fleeting moves.
The poor for the cold wars, then, were drawn up by translations when they were underflowing.
The satellite investigation and the spread sond field in ice floors are a useful supplement, but many still do thanks to unrestricted individuals who camp in the winter.
Mr. Anderson is watching the outstanding world of the sleeping system inside the arctic ice created by the flowing of frozen water, which is brushing in the wheat.
But from the above of the beverage to microscopic miracles, it's all been determined to be determined as soon as the ice moves, which sometimes plays between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... that can be we.
6000 marine farmers placed funeral tombs in Arlington
De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled by seven hours a bus to put a simple soldier in the grave of a soldier who never met.
For and the rest of the marine farmers who traveled from Johnson's camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, at the National Sepultures in Arlington, to enjoy the funeral, it was the day when he delivered the hold to men and women who had ever taken the same roof.
In a few months when we get married, we can be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
And when that happens to us, I want someone to do the same for me to show me my mind as I'm just trying to do.
He was one of more than 6000 volunteers who saved the Sabbath to put the veterans on the funeral in a few divisions at the Arlington court act.
In 1992 Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington in the state, started this tradition when he and a few other people decided to get a few hundred funerals in Arlington.
Now this is 18 years old tradition when Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen are undertaking this road every year and standing in different cities on the road to honor the memory of military members and the victims of terrorism.
Worcestesters are not looking for wins, other than America, which are placed in other states.
In this year, the volunteers placed more than 16000 people on the Arlington grave, on the Pentagon Territory, on the tombs of the National Sepulture Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City, and in the memory of the flight number 93 United Airlines in Shanksville in Pennsylvania.
In the second year, Walmart's delivery is more than $150,000 for purchasing and transport.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, noted that she was traveling to Arlington to honor her husband, an armed host of armed forces.
Because her husband wasn't buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said that it was her way to return what she did to the victim.
It's a little way citizens can support our units, she said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
The volunteers of the heavy substance passed into the plastics after the surroundings and coverages.
The volunteers were intended to the elder tombs of the first and second world war and of the war in Vietnam because they were not visited as often as newer tombs.
We were positive when the children played and together holded their hands when they transported a young battle to our long buried stones.
Each circle was darkly green with a small red cloud of birds upstairs.
Approximately § in the 60th section, where the number of veterinarians from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan was buried, remained quiet.
The United Services Organizations have developed 1000% for the Department's Deliverance, but the disturbance of the current war has just filled this.
Some weeped sincerely, others prayed, and families and friends kept one another in cold air.
Some read the voice named, thrown into stones, while others adorned to see small black white names attached to a milk floor, where they have not yet been placed in the grave stones.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shot their tears from their eyes before her son's grave.
She went eight hours from Zanesfield in Ohio to visit the latest rest of the Sergeant of the Maritime Worker David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should never forget why we are free, my son paid for it, rules.
"And when I was gone, I want to be the one who's going to get up."
American Government supplier captured by Cuban Government officials
The Cuban Government arrested the American Government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country as the Ministerial officers introduced on Saturday.
A supplier who has not yet been identified worked for the development alternatives Inc. with the seat in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officers, together with the American Interest Section in Hawaii, seeked access to the arrested one who was arrested 5.
Certain accusation was not published, but according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for anything that is referred to as "period."
All such anti-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, lead to the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-control graphics and words are considered to be serious criminal acts.
There is a young bloging community in Cuba, led by the archaeological comment of Yoani Sánchez, which often writes about how she and her husband are monitored and charged by government agents.
Mrs Sánchez repeatedly requested the authorisation to leave the country so that it could take the prices, but the authorisation was cancelled.
The maintenance of the American supplier may be an investigator of growing pressure between the Communist Castro Brother, Governing in Cuba, and the Obama Administrative, which was followed as "containing tactics" in improving the relations with the island.
As the first report of the New York Times prison on Friday night.
The New American Policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes specific steps, such as the release of political legislation and creates more space for opposition, the United States will have a reciprocal step.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed on Cuba, although these are new and searched commodities in the country where the average payment of the State employee does $15 per month.
The Cuban Government has granted the normal citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are used by a frequency before sending text messages because the 15-minute phone talk would be more than one daily payment.
The use of the Internet on the island is extraordinary.
It is available in dear hotels and for their visits and at some government adjudications, such as universities.
The Kubans who are often trying to be declared must notify their names to the government.
Access to many websites is banned.
It's frequency to keep America on Cuba.
Most of the United States citizens in Cuba are outside the networks for triple acts such as feeding drugs, Gloria Berben, printing officer of the American Interest Section in Hawaii.
Mrs. Berben said she could not provide more information about the procedure.
The prison and the detention were democratic.
Such activities would be legal in any other opening company - let's give free mobile phones - are on Cuba a criminal act, said Miguel Vivanco, Director of the American Programme for Human Rights, which has recently published an unnecessary report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, this Cuba", as a charge for the installation of Raula Castra as a leader of the country and a replacement for the elderly brother Fidel.
Vivanco noted that complaints are often arrested, condemned and imprisoned in one day.
He noted that any solution would be more political and that the Cuban government often causes negative reactions in the United States, just when these two countries are focused on a more comprehensive dialogue.
The Pakistanian work of the State administration is aware of the disturbance of the sending of men to Afghanistan.
The Pakistan authorities discovered on Saturday a data leader of spiking about the sending of five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill the American units members there, and said that they hoped that this case could help to discover a broad network of terrorist verbs that follow the Internet and search radicalized young men.
Researchers noted that they were watching for a wide range of persons known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after first discovered, when one of these men published a comment, which approved terrorist attacks has a YouTube video site.
Saifillah took the leading of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, trying to help them get to the remote Pakistan in the Pakistan domestic tribes, which is the home of al-Kaida and its camps for the training of terrorists.
But the Pakistanian rapporteur officer, who reported the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to testify the commanders of Al-Kajda and that men were not part of the trial of infiltrating into the terrorist network.
Thus, after a few days to the east quarter of Sarghoda, far from the horrible mountains northwest, which became a refuge of terrorists.
They were considered as a cover unit.
The reasons why they were exhausted, the officer who spoke of the conservation of anonymity as regards the sensitivity of the case.
The officer noted that men were not afraid and still tried to get an agreement to get access to the camps of al-Kaida when they were arrested by the execution of Pakistan's rights.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was heard by the FBI - highlights the critical role of the conspirators in identifying potential terrorists, and maybe, which is much more important, to determine who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks on 11 September 2001, the American expert service has assigned the highest priority to the attempts to place human rows to al-Kaida.
Organizers work as guardians, who are not sufficiently serious in their commitment to the Holy War and those who could be teachers.
The American false recruits were detailed at al-Kaidy's special examination, the analysis.
However, they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because, due to their potential access to America's objectives and their propagation value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an elder analytic in the NEFA opinion with the seat in the United States, noted that terrorist groups have also become more careful in the past years, which will enable them to come, because the American reporting agencies have gained experts on their advertising methods.
We are trying to go into these groups, not better than to act in accordance with their model of collection, which has already been so followed?
This model is one of those who are much more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Kodani, requested the climate "actions"
Tens of protestants walked on the streets this Sabbath and requested a more significant action on climate than the negotiators in the city conference center of Bell.
Protestants indicated the number of statistics of this event, but the police insisted that the amount was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and the worst of masked activists put a few small stocks near the group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On the day when the small income of the climate discussions that the United Nations sponsored, thousands of activists passed through the city and weared transparency with the Ethiopian titles "This is not planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish, which said "The Land says 'soft'."
The protest has been made to celebrate a few of the Danish models and photographs of Helena Christiansen, which suggested that she was traveling to her mother's parents in Peru and provided me information about the unfortunate state of the country on which the impact of climate changes continues to be affected.
This is a part of the reason why we decided to join this big step -- to go through the world and call for the world's leadership to present a just, ambitional and binding agreement, she said.
It's not a easy job, but it's necessary to perform it, it can't be avoided.
The police prohibited protestants to draw close to the Bell center and noticed that she had 19 persons, in the first place, because they had a mask or had a knife with herself.
These activities are prohibited in accordance with Denmark's rights during the demonstration.
According to one of the unemployed wheels that would not want to be identified because it is involved in climate roofs, activist masking as sports and in black clothes have placed a number of places near the Codecanic main channel near a number of ministers.
They agitated at the buildings, introduced, started with lights, but then followed "a few big explosions."
Inside the Congress Centre, people broke around the television education to follow the travel during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not go into the domain of key officers, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When he was asked whether the demonstration would have been influenced on international negotiations, he answered English "Atually, that is something that I was not aware of" (is actually something I don't know).
Then he continued in the chinch, and he said, "Because it's spread, I can't hear what's going out."
He watched whether the travel was painful or helpful depending on the views of everyone.
It is to see the focus of the broad public and different sectors and the subject of climate changes, he said.
In other words, "I can also say that it is the violation of the deeds or the freedom of the rest of the people.
Test data discovered continuously sustaining racial differences
The Federal Certificate from last week of knowledge of mathematics was a welcome part of the good news about the public school of Columbia.
Although the surrounding is far to be highly executive systems of the country, the testimony has shown more progress in the fourth and eight classs in the last two years than in the cities of the Atlantic, Chicago and New York.
But what remains behind the last numbers of the National Ateist Centre for Progress in School is the survival differences in knowledge achieved between Afro-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average outcome of white white whites of the fourth class of Columbia in the past two years increased from 267 to 270 points (perhaps of 500), but in their African species, there were only three points, from 209 to 212.
The scope in the achieved knowledge increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress in Africans in the eighth class remains basically balanced, with the exception of statistically unsignified one of 245 to 245.
The average output in white wheels was not included in test outputs because the sample size was not sufficiently large.
The image at the horizon of six years is not just encouraged.
The division between white and black jackets of the fourth class in 2003, when the first NAEP was carried out in the circuit, was 60 points of the stage (262 to 202).
Although the achieved outcome in children from both groups has improved during this period, the division has drawn close to 58.
Some appointments of training in the surrounding area in the last week have concluded that the outcomes, celebrated by Michelle A. Rhee's secrets and the older Adrian M. Fentym (D) were more stimulated in white students, where they had already been high results.
This would say that we have increased the summary of the support of those at the highest end of the stage, which is problematic and anxious, Jeff ́ith, Executive Director D.C. Voice, a non-profit group, which involves the equality of training in the area.
I don't go up and down for two or three points, said a member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth class of the basic school in Eaton.
In criticizing the administration of Mrs. Rhee often, Mrs Brown stated that the report on test outcome means a middle-school in the city is in a lossy state and requires attention.
It's obvious that you want to see claims and I respect it.
But what's terrible that we did not almost spend any time and energy that was needed for our medium-school.
Mrs. Rhee said that the attempt to circuit is to continue searching for better ways related to the needs of students with low results.
This fall, for example, are some scholars trained in the use of new bases read, the Wilson reading system, related to students of higher schools and students of high schools, who could not control the foundations of reading before in their knee career, significantly depends on their kind of schools.
The daily mathematical and basic lessons of math in the sixth class, highlighting games and experiences of real life that have been reached in the surrounding of the former director Clifford Janeyi, is myself to add to the top of the NAEP progress, which has been reported last week.
And I just think they had to continue working and do the best of the students who stayed under classes, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others have noted that NAEP's outcomes explained the question whether Mrs. Rhee could continue to increase the total performance of the system and continue to provide further money and employment for schools with low performance, which is necessary to reduce differences.
It's a certain profitable dilemma, Mrs. Michel Rheeov, said Bruce Fuller, professor of learning at the California University in Berkeley, where he studies test results in towns.
The conventional correction procedure is to promote school reforms and administrative reforms located in the worst parts of Columbia.
This can lead to political doses that contradict the important agency.
However, the expenditure belongs to the rest of the cities managers who are trying to maintain the mean range between white and black.
We have to focus on building a large school system.
We need to use our school family so that all families, notwithstanding where they live, may be able to make their child a great public learning.
Mr. Janey, now the director of the school in New York, said in the interview this week that the main element of decreasing the difference between the achieved results is the prolongation of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the circuit to achieve the rights of school.
You have to get up to 200 days to make changes, Mr. Janey said, who closed with his school teachers' association for a school year in 185 days, which is a "sign" for the search for the most important increase in the next year.
Make higher education parts of the better future
The coastal bus went into Gettysburg's hotel with a voice breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, rose up and relaxed on white columns, circle fasads and smaragd green traces.
Gracielini parents tried to graduate a high school in El Salvador.
Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never gone to the ground of a railway.
Now she and the other eight-party girls in the group were studying Gettysburg, where school was 38690 dollars per year, their position was more than fearing visiting potential students.
Yes! That's it! she called Graciel who would have studied the medical when he offered them to enter the building.
Gentlemen, the rules were thoughtful when they made them a low proportion of professors to students.
Pennsylvania's rail was one of the seven who visited on their triday engagement and now were completely reported by the future report: The question is not whether you will enter the railway.
The question is from where.
However, this is a weakening problem regarding the high number of children of Spanish immigrants born in the United States, who are exhausted from high schools or are pregnant as non-evolutionary, but there are statistics of those who receive further education and so enter the middle class.
The fifth of this "sue generation" of Spanish boys from the rail - aware outcome that many of their immigrant parents, the majority of the Mexicans and the Middle-American people, have reached the United States without finishing high school.
The story of their success is important, the investigators are aware that it highlights their point of road for the generation that played a border role in the field of work forces of the country.
Those who have reached high school education say they had a natural attitude to school and natural rebellion and attempt to succeed.
Many parents also had high goals to their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of the American School.
But school programmes also play an extraordinary role in the help of Graciele and millions of children that would have ever resolved a series - especially if these efforts were overtime.
We see that children's beauty from groups with low income, whose parents have no experience and ability to help them in the system, which is not a simple principle at each individual point, says Patricia Gándar, researcher at the Californian University in Davis, where students from Latin America studied.
We have to think about it, and we have offered this kid a mysterious network in the pre-school in all ways to get a high school.
The Federal Programme, which financed Graciely's commitment on the road, is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (appropriately) provides more than 300 million dollars annually for local school systems for launching further preparatory programs, starting for students from small school groups and continueing until these students end high school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, of whom more than 1% has entered into the school, according to the data of the United States Ministry of School.
The Iraq Ministry of Fisheries has reached agreements with 10 farming companies
Without prejudice to the concerns of violence and political stability, the Iraq Government has been able to enable a significant agricultural company to reconstruct its unnecessary infrastructure during two events running on Saturday.
Ten agreements concluded by the Iraq Ministry of Field Industrie with foreign farming companies, which indicates that Chinese, Russia and European agriculture companies are prepared to play a significant role in the restoration of Iraq's farming industry, protected by decades of wars and sanctions.
America's companies moved to two of the 10 fields.
Seven American companies paid for a second one that started on Friday.
Only one offered a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on the field that was taken in June.
The scarlet of American farming giants in the opened Iraq farming industry surprised the analysis.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and the place of the American companies you have here in the first place on the Asiat and European travel, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, online reporting.
It's gonna be before anything else will be in Iraq to sell.
Anxieties of security, highlighted by a mass coordinated by bomb attacks on Wednesday and Political Instability, like download of American armies, probably reflect American companies from a much more intense company in Iraq, which is demonstratively the third largest surface reserves, say analytics.
The American companies were in some cases in a disagreement, particularly the Chinese and the final governments controlled energy company have significantly lower operating costs and are more attractive to risk because they do not correspond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and O日al Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies who concluded agreements with the Ministry.
Previous American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhips, who maintained close contacts with the Iraq Ministry of Industrial Industrie and offered technical assistance in the past years, left with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholders in two of the contracts assigned at the end of this week.
State Chinese National Petroleum Corp. shared in offers in more contracts than all the other companies and went with large shares in contracts in two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to make it with the main economic force, as well as the power, said the speaker of the Ministry of Agriculture of Assam Jihad.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to competition and fulfil their commitments against Iraq.
Communities which were pre-selected for the presentation of offers, which were then compared to the ministries according to the price of barley and the Ministry, are willing to pay for the increase in the outcome of the current level on each field.
The al-Kaidy spy planner was obviously killed in Pakistan.
In the impact of the American rackets at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, it was apparently killed the spice planner of the Al-Kajda operations, as told by the American Anti-Terrorist Division of Friday.
As confirmed, it could be a second death attack on one of the highest terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when a number of cracked on their cars near the city of Miran Sáh in the North Vaziristan province, according to American resources and Pakistan officials.
The local offices have felt that the rackets were removed from the airport without the type of which it operates in the range of illegal domestic tribes.
They were listed on a white car that passed to the Afghanistan border when he was arrested, the officer and the Pakistanian citizen expert agent who called from Miran Shah.
The Officer noted that local weapons were attached to the point and enjoyed what was left of "total destructed body".
The local authorities were not able to verify the identity of the victims, but two American anti-terrorist officers cited an unspecified witness who said that Somali was after death.
Somali was described as a highly established military operation planner for al-Kajda, who managed terrorist groups operations outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was engaged in the refunding worldwide, said the higher officer who would not be appointed, which indicated the sensitive respect of American airports in Pakistan.
He remained in such a central position, probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the highest leadership of Al-Kajda and on the basis of them, he could have planned terrorist attacks.
Another American officer said that Somalia had been in the al-Kajda hierarchy and was well linked to the final extremist groups in the region.
He didn't have to be a generally known person for some Americans, but that he didn't be humiliated in any way to call for us and our associates, said the other officer.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second highly established leader of al-Kaidy or Taliban who should be killed since September when the same attack was killed by the Namdin Jalolov, the leader of the military group in the past of the domestic tribes and three other poperative leaders.
The time of the attacks started with the pilot airports has been decreased from the average of about six operations per month to two, according to the records of Long War, the website, managed by the nazi group.
Decrease may have a decrease in the improved terrorist group tactics that have made steps to restrict their vulnerableness by also murdering the persons who were suspicious of being informators.
The Universal Delegate of the United Nations in Kabul was departed.
The United Nations Supreme Delegate of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday, that he would like to leave from his own position in March and end the so abusing period, which was charged by a large corruption in the election of the president in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
It comes to Eide's department because Obam's administration decided to send another 30000 American soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations delegate noted that he supported growth, but expressed anxiety that the United States time period for decreasing the status that begins in 18 months should be a challenge to the Government of the remaining NATO States to obtain their strength.
We need to work in the building of Afghanistan security forces and send the correct signal to Afghanistan that they have confidence in the international community, Eide introduced in the phone interview from Kabul.
The accepted commitment must be adequate.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and the remaining military forces to increase the number of international civilian employees assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The growth on the side of armed forces must be copied from civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not rejecting, but simply fulfilling the promise that he gave his family in March 2008 that it was only two years in Cabul.
He said he wanted to report the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now stated that he would need time to find a refund.
As I said, it's the highest time to look at the follower, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the department of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the United Nations officials, the Ban began searching for a refund.
The officers noted that it was decided between Staffan di Mistrua, who had a Swedish-Italian pı and had previously conducted the United Nations mission in Bagdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, France, who had previously conducted the United Nations peace operation.
The Eide position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused of president Hamid Karzai, who wins in the earthly presidential elections from masking the presence of massive election machines.
Eide dismissed this statement, but he noted that Galgraith's accusation -- which was released -- "determinedly harmed the mission because there was a high degree of skepsis in view of the international principles" at the election.
Eide noted that he attended a meeting with the highest representative of the citizens in order to coordinate the deployment of efforts in the United States force leading in Afghanistan.
He also urged the United Nations leadership to enable his representatives to gain more work from the United States and the rest of the western countries that would contribute to the Afghanistan mission, so he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is required properly.
Eide expressed a disappointment over the restriction of his efforts in Afghanistan and noted that the United Nations difficult Regulation on the capture of undergroups and its ability to use skills.
The United Nations rules are that I had the opportunity to get only one person from May, he said.
It's a disaster and I can't continue.
Gates: Iran faces other sanctions
The Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world power will soon take Iran "only significant sanction" because of the lack of employment in discussions on his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in Northern Iraq during the weekly road in the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, bagates the views of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
It's not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the question of the soldier's probably development.
One of the things that depend on me is whether I have learned about something from Iraq in the last six years, [it] is an incredible ignorance in the war.
The ambam's administrative decision is at the package of sanctions that could include the Iran military and political elitis, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect the common Iranians.
He said that the "country of consequences and detentions" would require "to take the Iranian government to feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer extraordinaryly" sanctions.
According to the Friday statement issued by the speaker of the White House Robert Gibbs, the administration involved the European leader in warning that Iran would bring serious results if he did not carry out its nuclear programme in full compliance with the United Nations Committee for Nuclear Security and its supervisory authority, the International Agency for Atomic Energy.
Iran's awareness that he wants to develop his professional knowledge only for peaceful people.
In the discussions in January 1 October, he pointed out that he wanted to return to the discussions on the restriction of his nuclear programme and agreed that he would provide a significant part of its resources of the rich uran in exchange for the necessary fuel for the reacter to conduct medical research.
It has been established for such a agreement as a way to determine confidence between both parties and to gain time for negotiations.
However, since that time, Iran seems to decline from the provisional agreements - partly because, because the Iranian leadership is divided in view of whether to engage in the United States.
It is honestly said, in the case of Iraq's firmness towards the international community in the case of certain opinions he agreed at the beginning of October, I think that it has brought the international community, including Russia and China, together on the road, which is not about the termology of additional sanctions against Ireland, said Gates.
President Obama set the final term for Iran on 31st to answer us before he returned to search for other choices in the field of investigation, which is called Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions".
In the statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission in the United Nations judged on Thursday what it called "unsubordinated and unsubmitted" before some members of the Security Committee on Iranian Nuclear Activities and claimed that he wanted to continue in conversations with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with the Irish Ministerial President Nouri al-Maliki before he flew to Kurdistan, rich on the floor to meet soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
It endures high pressure between Kurda and the Iraq Arabic, particularly because of the border, own rights and the distribution of revenue.
Gtes urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflicts to prevent the maintenance of the United States plans to restrict the number of American soldiers from 115000 to 50000 to the end of August.
Gates also tried to disturb Kurdish anxiety from the sustaining depression. The United States official places felt Gates when he communicated Massud Barzaani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in the United Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In ancient China, the change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up with propagandist plates on which they read that "The Mother of Earth is too exhausted to enjoy more children" and "Every child also means one more tomb."
Then they learned that when the official government places in Shanghai were alarmed by low generations and older populations in their city, immediately changed the course in this year and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediately and decided: Never.
We have always abandoned all our time and energy just to one child.
We haven't left anything for the other, says Wang, 31 years old, a human resource manager who has a 8-month son.
For more than 30 years, China's policy to have only one child was introduced and thus created two generations only a notoric and appealed children, affectedly affected by the "Small Empires", threatening the population crisis.
The average ratio decreased 1.8 children to a couple compared to six before the political entry into force, according to the United Nations data.
The division of the population, where the population level of 60 years and higher is expected to grow from 16,7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31,1 per cent in 2050. This is far above the total average of 20 per cent.
Inequality is more rich coast cities with population with high school education, for example in Shanghai.
Loni people in about 60 years old and higher were 22 percent in Shanghai registered people, while the birth was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, manager of the Shanghai town Commission for the population and family planning, said, many couples have to have children to "help to reduce the proportion of the older population and to reduce the growth of work forces in the future".
He says that it's "being old, it doesn't mean to be rich -- like in developed countries, such as Japan or Sweden."
Advanced calm
As the country was introduced in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is probably the most contradictory mandate of the communist party.
Two who violated the policy faced unrepentant repentances -- three times their annual payment in some -- and discrimination in the work.
China's official places have promoted a policy that has helped the country to prevent the critical loss of natural resources, while human rights chargers were condemned in promoting the policy.
In the foreign area, some officials have invited pregnant women to be born in the second child.
Moreover, many two had to be sexually selective, leading to the unnaturally high relationship of men against women.
In the past years, the population officials have been gradually smaller in their settlement to a child's policy.
In 2004, they have actually granted exception - including cities, national minorities and cases when men and women were single - and in 2007, they have measured the dix of their passphrases, which are a strong line.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor of the population research institution of the Peking University, said that the officers of the Central Government had already discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was one.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city, which sent down an aggression campaign for encouraging to more generations.
Instead of the night, there were plates, who invited parents to have only one child, replaced by copies of Regulations, detailedly described how to have another child and how to ask for authorisation.
The town administration sent officers for the planning of family and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and to deal with flights under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, the family planning officers introduced.
Disturbing response
Although officers in a foreign town around Shanghai mentioned an increasing interest in two who wanted to have another child after the campaign started, the majority of the cities did not make any changes.
The urban area of Huinan with the population 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
The disappointed officers in Shanghai stated that, even though the campaign has been born in the city in 2010, only about 165000 - quite higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, the leader of the family planning committee in the Shanghai Fourth Caolu, stated that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to give it the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that she had two children and was legally allowed to them.
But as many Chinese who have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by government.
Without a dotational mysterious network, the choice could be unresponsibility.
Western people consider a child's policy wrongly as a conflicting legal issue, says Yang, a building engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in relation to the first child.
Yeah, we were preserved to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples use the psychological dung weight.
Wang, human resource manager, says they want only one child because she was also the only one: "We were the center of our families and all cared about us.
We weren't used to provide care and we didn't want to care for others.
Chen Sieian, 42 years old, who is a government translatorship company, made it much more uncovered.
For two-carrier parents in the middle class who reduced birth, he said that being successful means to be selfish.
Today, 20 and 30 years of age are viewing parents as the first days of China's experience with capitalism, and they do not want this way of life for themselves, says.
Just one kid claims an enormal demand for parents' time, says.
Mother has to sacrifice at least two years of her community life.
Then there are still difficult issues of space -- "You must stop your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You must have a summary prepared at the time when the child is nine months for a good pre-school education.
Most of his friends want to please one child, says Che, but not two.
We're the first generation with higher food standards, he says.
We don't want to offer too many victims.
The United Nations group has drawn up a plan for destruction.
The United Nations sponsored climate - characterised remotely unpopulated positions and mutual consideration -- again on Friday, it focused on the release of a document that implies ambitional decreasing the quantity of glass gases during the next 40 years with industrialized nations, the inconsistency of the burden in the nearest term.
The text that can provide the east of the final political agreement on the regulation of glass gases highlights the remaining obstacles as it lights the road forward.
But it was to see an important progress in negotiations that passed wrong time with more than 100 world leaders who would come to Codana next week.
The work created by the United Nations ad hoc group, this text unlikely indicates how much money the poor countries should provide to those poor in order to organize global heating short-term and time.
And provides the entire election palette for key issues, including how to develop and control the future economics so that they can limit their output of carbon and what the top level of global temperature growth should be, which political factors will still be able to tolerate.
This provides a large dose of flex, says John Coequyt, the top representative of the Washington Club of Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, construction of 180 pages of the text of the negotiation to what the spice officer of the climate issues of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as "a large image".
It sets out the burdens for my agreement, whereas industrial nations could together limit their levels to 25 to 45 per cent in comparison with 1990 levels, while the main development countries could reduce their levels to 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Commonly, the country would decrease between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union negotiated on Friday the promise that it would offer 3.6 billion dollars during the next three years to help the poorer countries accept the adaptation to climate changes -- from the potential of smoking and drying to the prohibition of solving.
But on Friday, the same type of verb fire tools that were overwhelmed during discussions last week.
The U.S. Special Sender for climate issues, Todd Star, refused the speech, which requires mandatory restrictions for gases for industrial countries in comparison with the voluntaryness of the main developing economy if they were not financed by the developed world.
The movement signaled that Obam's administration had set a stronger line against China as Bush's officials just two years ago.
The United States will not access without transfer of main development countries and the implementation of actions, said Star, who also observed that the text was not sufficient to ensure restrictions and should be verified by external observers.
Staren performed this comment for a hour after the Chinese headquarters of He Yafei had communicated to the American main negotiator about climate issues that the lack of "sellic understanding" or "unresponsibility" led to the report that the United States would not help China financially so that it could be prepared for global heating.
With the future of the economic roads of the main world powers in the creation, the tachynics and the developing world, both between the industrial world and the economic development.
The current struggle leads to the preservation of individual economys rather than to maintain the planet, between China and the United States in respect of the fulfilment of their relevant obligations, while poor people warn that two decades of the most affected countries of the world ignore the deep emperation for the implementation of further actions.
Ricardo Ulate, the delegate of Kosovo, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting for the costs of limiting gases, while the vulnerable countries became much more aggressive in searching for a way to prevent the large issuers of responsibilities in their actions.
It's a game that the new economic hegemonie is developing, Ulate said, which also serves as regional adviser in regional climate changes in Mexico and Central America for international protection of nature.
Some of the countries who are the most vulnerable effects of climate changes indicated that they would like to continue the legally binding agreements in Codan, but most of the majors, said that the best outcome of discussions would be a political agreement.
The alignment of the small islands, which has 43 members, created a 24-page agreement last Friday.
Arturge-Metzger, who conducted international climate negotiations in the benefits of the European Commission, said that the promotion from small island nations "was a political impact on the entire polite process" partly because they are now united and require action from growing economy, such as China and India.
The action was a new importance when delegates focused on the need to resolve the number of remaining issues of controversy before the Government heads agree.
High positions of officers, such as the Indian Ministry of Life Protection of Jairam Rames and the Chinese Ministry, came out of the airport and passed by the Bella centre to the closed door of meetings and new works, so they could address the claims that will be dealt with next week.
The total number of meetings - when 13,000 people were transferred daily from and to the congress center, the cytars playing activists inscened in the night ironising views of countries that they thought they were sent and affected the transfer of hands to the paper rather than by electronic mail -- controlled challenges.
Intensity is only a surprise: in Codan, all the key ministers were present and earlier in the middle of 60 heads of the States.
We have reached high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Ministry of Global Policy at the International Protection of Nature.
They're getting hard weights.
British first train with 140 miles per hour pre-defined the feelings this Monday
at 5:13 on Monday the star cut the darkness on the sign of the drag, which meaned the revolution of transportation in British.
The high-quality personal impact in the country will reach 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford in Kentu to St Pancras and overcome the distance of 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and put into the first high-quality personal adjustment outside LLndyn.
He hopes that the new service, where appropriate, connects British with the international networks of trains and connects large Midland, north and Scotland with London.
Conflicted steadfast waters should reduce transport times in personal transport and travel travel and travel from aircraft and cars to railway, and can reduce carbon and eliminate straightways.
Theoretics have been allowed to get three main political parties for this vision.
But tens of milliards of liberal frees necessary to build a new national railway network, an inevitable fight against projects and anxieties about the deterioration of life have now increased the construction of British high-speak-rates.
High Speed Two (HS2), the company created in January to provide a implementable study to the government, transmitted its report to Lord Adonis 30's report, as Times' reported.
She gave him a detailed map of the travel of another planned stage high-quality network.
The new traveling of London to the West Midland has been proposed to five meters in towns and quarters, where it could be a problem to touch the life center.
In the opened country, the final road was planned up to 25 m.
HS2 also assumes to specify three options for a high-quality network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer the jail.
The preliminary choice is the configuration of the letter of Y when a high-quality trace should lead to West Midland.
Trat should be shared near Birmingham with one-party traveling from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One trace should lead to Scotland.
"It seems to have happened to the most effective choice," said the railway engineer.
As soon as it's done, the carrier time between London and Edinburk will be shortened for two hours and 40 minutes.
By the stage opened before 2025, it could enable the traveler to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes in comparison with more than one hour in presentation.
The trains should be enabled to drive 2250 miles per hour, which would result from the British network in Europe.
The starting trace is already used in order to carry the weapons in the length of 400 m , which would be able to transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 conferences could operate every hour on London - Birmingham.
It means that the London terminal would be able to serve in the case of a need of up to 20000 travelers in an hour.
In view of the restriction of the ability, the existing stations would be extended in order to capture a high-quality network.
Professors of the railway industry claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offers such a potential.
Lord Adonis will notify whether or not to implement this scheme, but general public consequences and planning procedures means how the final decision will not take place before the general elections.
Even if he introduces a car to the movement, the network should be built on parts.
The clouds should first be introduced to the operation, not to high-economy traits, but already existing traits north of Birmingham and to keep the railtimes between London and Scotland over three hours.
It is considered a decision-making point to ensure the transition from the aircraft to the train, the orientation point for the revolution on the railway.
Tax chargers furnished the hypotech of 75,000 pounds on the Tory Ornangeria
Alan Duncan, the main-seed lay holders of Tory's officers in the missionary song, have furnished the tax payers thousands of liberties of costs last year for the orangery that he built in his house in the election area.
the speaker's foreign party, degraded by David Cameron because he was depressed that the lawyers lived "from the ships", he increased his hypoteca to 75,000 pounds to build an extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to make a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month for tax chargers.
The general authorities have approved the claims of time and have not been heard by Sir Thomasen Leg, who carried out the control of the expenditure members.
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of the Parliament, has two double-site houses in the village of Rutland and Melton.
The houses have a value of about a million pounds.
There is a kitchen, a residence room and a food, but the financial authority agreed that Mr. Duncan has more space.
Last year he added to the house a winter garden, which is in plans called "foreign".
Neighbors describe it as a "beach for entertainment and hospitality".
Mr Duncan was not requested to provide an increased explanation for the latest control by the Committee for General Standards and Privileges in the latest equation of the hypoteque.
The committee told him last month that he violated the rules after reviewing his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the pupilary security on hypoteque to 271406 pounds from his ownership in London to the house in his election area, which he bought in 1991, before he became a member of the lawyer.
The documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan ordered approximately 1400 pounds per month in the interest of the hypoteca to March of the year.
In April, his charges increased to more than 1800 pounds per month.
The interest of the RBS hypothetic payment of Mr Du Papana could not be changed at this time, which indicates that all of this was intended to finance the loan for 75000 pounds.
In 2007, the standard RBS variable of the hypothetic payment decreased from 7.94 per cent by 4 per cent in March of this year, where it remained.
The final document of the General Agency shows that Mr Duncan continued to complain 1250 pounds per month in May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as a shadow leader of the House in September after one secret reporter filmed him and said the deputy must survive "to the department" after the expenditure scandal.
"In principle, it's popular, you have to live in the assignment, and it's with you as with s**t."
He said, "I lost money for my garden, my charge, and a little break on what was necessary.
And I could prompt all the fucking part, but I'm not going to do it."
A missionary, a million of former career as a robber, was first invited to explain his publications in May, when it was shown that he had proposed thousands of fun for his garden, even before he approved the financial authority that it could "be considered to be excessive".
One of the activists buried a jaw in the face of a sign of li'a in the tra'case of Mr Du'an to protest after it was discovered that he had ordered 4000 pounds for three years.
When he was asked to increase the hypothesis last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of the increase of the resource, which was approved as well as by the financial authority, so the Lee."
He added: "it is not a conflicting question of hiding and calling or violating the rules or something else.
It's absolutely equal to the line down, according to rules, legal, and that's all.
This would not be a lot of other ways more clean or easier."
Come on, all of you watch the chat on the Brighton Coast with an advent calendar.
Coast chats in Brighton found a new sense of life in a widespread month as an interactive advent calendar.
Besides, the alternative church and the group that encourages Duco's survival of creativity invited 24 owners to get their chats for every day in the branch, and to use Christmas collies as the theme of this extent.
The event started when the visitors enabled them to view the last chat every day from 17.30 to 18.30, and the bishop bread and covered wine freely provided.
The selected colleagues included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas when the chat represented the work of Janetty Tozer, local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, assistant in the television marketing from Hove, is a priest without a stipendium in the chichester dizezez and leader Beyond.
He said: "We want to do religion much more important for people in the postchristian society.
"Why do we have a church to expect people to come into an alien old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in a proud way.
"The idea of the advent calendar in the chat came just as a conversation with some friends during the dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsing place, and we have tried to try and present it by the way."

We can't say, it's time for it, the Benin singer Angelique Kidjo's announced.
In Africa, rivers and water flows are dry, and we can walk in them today, and it has never been possible before.
First in the history of the climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the fighting for another world approached the environmental organizations.
The French European Messenger José Bová, one of the positions of fighting for another world, said that he came to Codea with the goal of "building climate and social justice". "The currently no division between the fight against global warming and fighting for another world."

The subjects of the landscape and the record will be strengthened in the reform of the general gimnasia, Chatel declared.
The Ministry of School Luc Chatel stated on Sunday during the JDD magazine that the subjects and headquarters will be "forced" in the reform of general gimnasia, despite their learning already in the past year with accuracy.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for everyone will be the same program from the general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the Minister, "they need to end with the coverage", because, according to specialisation S, they are not already related to precise practices" but "the best students are in it."
The EC and L specialisations cannot be for any subspecialisations, continue and highlight: "I have not heard many stories and intellectuals that would have difficulted to not find a record and a copy of professionals in the last year."
The investigation of the Official Agency, which published the Humanity Journal on Saturday, showed that seven French from ten (69%) did not agree with the Governing Project for the cancellation of the obligation learning of the record and the registry in the maturity year with the specialisation of S, thus many intellectuals and factors criticized this distortion, as well as some members of the right.
Instead, the Minister added that "nothing comes into consideration" to cancel the philosophy in the specialisation programme for the Maturity Year.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of educational education, while 16 organizations (studiants and committees) invited to mobilize the Sunday project, which, according to them, offers a pedagogic education of future gimnasia professors.
The Minister explained at the beginning of the year’s study of the Master Study 2 (M2) an acceptable test for their work and at the end of the year that verifys their ability to learn.
Professional stages will be involved during the second year of the Master Study and the first year before the students will be trained as a professor-stagist.
Recover all the loads that will be offered before the receiving operation, you will get more experiences with the cup, as well as 300 hours, continued.
The Minister also announced that "personal right to education", which still does not exist in national education.
He again confirmed the project for the cancellation of the school map until 2012.
At the Electrical University of the School, the highest schools have 15 minutes to convince the climate.
Fifty minutes for the presentation of the Code summit objectives: this is the call he announced at the conference of Jean Jouzel, a multi-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Development Professors (GIEC) to highlight the University of Ecole in Northern Ulm Street.
As an AFP reporter reported, Laureat Nobel's peace price was opened first of the "Ernest" seminar, which is a single-day seminar composed of 15 minutes of professional contributions, which will be covered and replaced by the public.
We wanted to do something that would come to people and on the basis of which they should be more pleased to learn something more, he explained at the occasion of 22 years Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who received a name according to the fish from the local lake that students named so.
Once a twenty-fire experts of individual discipline will be chosen and stated that the selection is based on their charism.
About the heating of the climate "We can talk for hours, but we can also fix the basic objectives for a few minutes" said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before fifty listeners without pre-prepared notes, only using graphs.
It is part of our work, highlighted with the view that the listeners know that "Codany's based on very seriously prepared foundations".
Videos on these suggestions will be located on the school web from 15st.
The next seminar "Ernest" is planned on Friday and other will follow regularly every two months.
Latest in payments: distortions overseers, planned measures
On Friday, the Committees of Overseers announced "general mobilization", since they request that the premies and transitional refunds be paid to them at Christmas holidays.
The prison FO (2. Supervisory Bodies) requested employees who would have a service to participate in demonstrations that ended on Wednesday before the periodic equipment, and to "lock them" and thus warn them on "the stole of their limits".
The CGT for the Years Supervisors (three committees of this sector) invited them to "convocate meetings in individual facilities and start primary mobilization" with "inadmissible and inacceptable" that "times and payments for work at night, on Sundays and holidays" which were made in October were not threatened in the province.
The Federal Union of Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa) is "inviting the total mobilisation... to demonstrate uncomfortableness and disturbance".
The Governing Board and the Ministry of Justice explain that the cross-term increased in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but ensure that debts will be reduced in January.
The office concluded that Michèle Alliot-Mariova had sent a notification to the Committees of Foreign Supervisors, which ensures that the payment will be carried out next month.
I know about the efforts that the legislational staff aims at ensuring the functioning and modernization of our legislation system, writes ministerially in its communication.
I have ordered the Administrative Directory to take immediate measures to add the Ministry of Alliot-Maria, which has resulted in a bad evaluation of the number of times, in the future.
Thus, the December salary will be low, with the exception of the management of workers, which provides the glorious premium for the implementation and fulfilling of the objectives, Ufap/Unsa, and for those "the budget is located".
It's simply a scandal, the interregional FO Union in Marseille and announced her decision to boycot "all meetings and calls".
Workers will not come to work on Sunday or on the holidays, if the payments for these days of October will be paid in the same way in the past, the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne will also be threatened.
In the time when we still give more jobs and more jobs without making us available another staff, it is comfortable to allow the employees to pay the lowest position for this, the CGT prison overseers in Bordeaux.
According to the committees, there is not the same way in all regions, some are better than the final.
Nevertheless, in any case of financial resources because not so, the General Secretary Ufap, Jean-François Forget, found.
Both claims that he gives "better gifts" on Friday than those who get
The American President Barack Obama, who is prepared for his first breakfast with his family in the White House, believed the "gods" of Oprah Winfrey's screen that he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I get."
The president and his wife, Michelle, talked in a special issue of the order that will be sent to the ABC station on Sunday evening about how they want to celebrate Christmas Festivals and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the small fourth partner of the family will get his advantage.
Jesus has also boa, said Michelle Obam with that the peak will also "obviously" receive a gift, as it comes from the levels of the preliminary order.
And Michelle Obam also threatened the statement of her husband on the quality of gifts that he gets, "I certainly don't, I gave you the prime gifts," she hurt the president.
Well, of course, he was required to agree with the president, but immediately with the humor he showed the finger on the pearl copper of the first lady, "Who then gave you this?"
In this very uncommonly released order, with a famous modernizer, which solemnly supported Barack Obam in his presidential campaign, the husbands of Obam also discussed their unbeliefed gifts that they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a round with ten degrees of translation, but also a basketball meat, which was able to meet him on his chenish father's wedding, only very rare.
I see how I saw my father who came to look at us on the breakfast, and how he gave me that basketball sword, the president told me.

Euro-2009/Small Basin: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Francouz Frédérick Bousquet, a three-fold medalist for the world's mastership in 2009 in the large basen, received a title for Europe's Mistership in 2009 in the small basen in Istanbul in a discipline, especially 50m free way.
On the day of the magicity, the combinations were allowed, only three world records fell, even though they were expected much more.
One of them overcome the Hungarian travel Evelyn Verras a 200-m pool travel and two remaining russian man's staff on 4x50 m pool travel.
A big grief for Bousquet, who made a deal on a world record of 50 m in a free way, whose holder is already in a large basement (20.94).
In one of the two king's disciplines, 50m free way, he won 28 years of France with 20.53 seconds finally in the finish, where ten ships first started instead of the eight running.
Bousquet struck Croatia Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia Sergei Fesicova (20.84), but he could not overcome the world record (20.30), as he assumed.
We can dream about something better, but I said, if the world record is in my reach, I'll try.
Like Bousquet, all vessels had combinations made from polyuretan, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
Combines have helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, which is the first host in 1999 on the same competition.
The use of the combination this time did not help Germans Paul Bi Mann, a double-fold world master in a large basen in Rome, who had a world record on the hands of the world.
The young boat couldn't overcome the record that holds 400 meters free way (3:32.77), but yet wins with another most time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian leader Nikito Lobintseve (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glassner (3:36.82)
I didn't get everything into that bathroom.
I knew that this time I wouldn't get the world record, but I was able to deal with my title and I fulfilled my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious concurrence in the future, explained Bi'mann.

The second injured life is in danger, according to police resources, evidently have been affected by living important authorities.
The pregnant woman then took herself and was transferred to the hospital "in a shock," said the police source.
The armed man who was obviously under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as he introduced the police resource, then fled to the street, still on the bulevard of Jean Jaurès.
He hurt two more, obviously in a case: a thirty-five-year-old man, the second seriously.
What happened to all of this isn't totally worthwhile, because everything was played at dinner hours.
He was weakened by two knifes that weared the cross behind his back, he said at the head of the Alliance Syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Presse.
A number of surroundings, including young people, have tried to stop and rearma, according to the testimony of the conserved AFPs.
I saw some 30-year-old guy in the green bunde.
Three young people tried to catch him.

United States: Lawyer of Poland again requests the end of the criminal proceeding
The Polish-France Revisor Romana Polandski again requested on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) to stop the penalty against his client, currently located in his Swiss residence because of the midst of the afery that occurred for thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the repository of the film "Pianist" criticized before three judges of the second court of the second period in California, a serious mistake that occurred during the judgment in the time of the event in 1977.
I'm asking for the stop of running now and immediately, the lawyer Hummel introduced and added that from the behavior of the judge who then decided in the matter, Laurence Rittenband "he had a shift in his back".
According to him, the judge (which had already died) had to act firmly with the State representative who told him that Roman Polandski deserved to take advice – which is a serious offence against the law.
Information about this conversation was found in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, searched and requested), from the mouth of the State representative, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally announced at the end of September that he was lying to the author's document.
In the case that the court refuses to stop the penalty, the lawyer Hummel will request the execution of a court accounting for which he will be able to submit evidence of his claim.
The complainant repeated what has already been said in the first state, that no serious simplification of a request to stop the penalty until Roman Polandski is left before the court.
The 76th year-old register fled from the United States in 1978, before the court made a trial in the matter of "unlawful sex ́k" with an unflying girl in 13 years.
Since that time, he has never returned to the United States territory.
The representative of the prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polandski " should be there to participate in the courting."
We want to show not only Roman Polaski, but also the other complained that it is possible to flee?
It's the opinion that the register "demands the court of kindness and rejects his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to make a decision has also emphasized that there are other alternatives to avoid.
Mr Hummel wasn't alone who asked to stop Romana Polanski's penalty.
For the representative of the victim, Samantha Geimer also asked again for the end of the penalty.
She recalled that her client would still not carry out the estimated burden every time the case of Poland is dealt with and added, "No one in this room can say that the process was just."
Thirty-two years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September by order of the United States
After more than two months behind the networks, he was released in the home procedure in his chalupe in Gstaadu, where he waited for the event.
Wall Street ends without direction, he's locking him a stationary dollar.

Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106,41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, introduced Mace ́cksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
It's staying hard, the volume of trade has been very decreased, and I think it's going to be until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and that "they have helped to improve the market in the area of economic relief," the analysis of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, small trade markets increased by 1.3% in November, which was already a second month after itself and much more than expected.
According to the preliminary estimate of the index of Michigan, the confidence of American consumers also returned and in the past month increased strongly to .4 against 67.4.
However, the indexs were increased by a new growth of the euro dollar price, which is the highest than two months, which "which presses down the economy-sensitive sector," Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank said.
Technological actions lose the ground under the feet.
The market with valuable papers has fallen.

According to David's son, the reports about Hallydaye's status are very positive.
The reports of Johnny Hallydaye's status are "very positive", as his son David struck us at his Friday arrival to the airport in Los Angeles, where he arrived to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for a few days.
The reports are very positive.
He's very strong and everything runs very well, David Hallyday announced when he arrived from Paris a minute after 13 hours of local time (21 hours of world time)
The son of songs, who acted calmly, declared that "what the most" would be delivered to the Los Angeles Cedars-Sinai hospital, in which Johny Hallyday was accepting on Monday because of the operational infection, after the operation of the outermost interoperable platelet, which was found in Paris on November 26.
According to the print statement, the night was sing in Los Angeles from dàu "investiged into an artificial sleep", which is to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor of Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles already listed in an artificial sleep. The hospitalization occurred from an infection after the operation of the remote inter-road platelet performed on November 26, Paris.
Because of serious damage caused by this principle, a singer had to be reoperated by night from midnight to Thursday .
According to the AFP photograph, his wife Laeticia participated on Friday in the French school representation in Los Angeles, who visits their daughter Jade.
The Presidency of the Orthodox Surgery and the traumatology of the hospital la Pitié-Salpētrière, Yves Catoné, announced that to songs to Los Angeles on Monday.
The manufacturer strongly accused Dr. Stéphana Delajouxe, neurochirurg, who sang on November 26, operated on Clinique International du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us that it was a massacre.
Chirurgs from Los Angeles announced that they were rebelled, Mr. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of the future court, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus thinks Johnny Hallyday's gone too much to Los Angeles and allowed his Paris chirurg.
I personally talked with the doctor phone, and he noticed that this road was not a problem, which surprised me very much because I had already suffered a two-fold grip of the interoperable platelets.
A few minutes ago at the RTL station, the song was obviously flying after a Paris operation without a train, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very known in artificial cross.
He operated Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before she died to a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he acted at that time.
In 2007, he also operated Charlotte Gainsbourg's heat when removed the hematome, which resulted in the hepatic blooding in the brain.
It is, however, a doctor with dark reputation, who has sometimes been condemned in cases of deficiency of medical care, for tax outcomes and foolishness.
A lawyer of the medical coma Olivier Metzner marked him as "a man without a snuck", which is "regularly" called before the medical room and who can't even "recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed things on Friday by his lawyer David Koubbi.
He announced that the progress had "deeply good progress" and the postoperative investigation was "normal".
Operation was not a hemorrhagic character, so the introduction of the train was not necessary," added.
The health problems of the song have grown since the year, and, in any case, it seems that the next turn is staying with the questionnaire.
It is obvious that the term of renewal of the planned tour on January 8 (Amiens, n.e.) appears too close, declared Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and invites the New Centre to continue to use their shortcut.
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDemFrançoise Bayroua, reacted on Friday to the attempt of the President of the New Centre, Herv Morin on the accuracy of the former Giscard party, which should not be used in any media under a threat of criminal trial.
Herve Morin publicly announced his intention to adhere to the UDF shortcut by François Bayrou not worth carrying her inheritance after giving his left hand.
The Minister of Defence, whose partner is UMP, had to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of New Centre (NC).
This step was supported by Mr Hervego de Charetta (ex-UMP now for NC), which is assigned to the property of the UDF marks because he first allowed it to register in 2004 in the National Institute of Industry (l'Institut national de la propriete industrial).
But on Friday evening, the Committee of the UDF Association of Françoise Bayroua, who are not intended to be exhausted, came out of his silence and gave the formal request of the Minister and the lawyers to stop using the shortcut and returned to the property of protective signs under the threat of the penalty.
In recent days, you have increased anxiety statement of your political movement + retake UDF+ shortcut, writes the Association in your letter signed 19 those of 24 members of the Committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis from Alliance Centrist.
Besides, you considered appropriate to locate on your propagation materials and on the welcome website of your name+Nouveau centre+, with the slogan +UDF today+, see also signatures of a letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this shortcut, the UDF committee, which requests the NC's movement immediately to remove all UDF changes of the name of UDF from all the propagation materials in a lot (these) websites."
In addition, Herv de Charrette asks "to give the property of the protection marks to the legitimate owners".
You will not do so, we will return to courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warning the signatures.
In his letter, it states that UDF is a fully political movement in 1978, and they believe that Mr. Morin and his friends "selected " the department in 2007 " to create competitive movement, as others in 2002, to establish the UMP.
The movement of New Centre has therefore no right to use the UDF shortcut (Union for la democracy française).
In addition, they assume that the latest UDF convention voted in 2007 for the connection to the MOD for three years and for the establishment of the committee for "moreal and material interests" of the association based on Valérym Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervego de Charrette, the Committee continues "when he registered a protective mark", "he has not been "three years of member of the UDF", but UMP.
He used the non-existing registration of acronyms in a scandal and subhydrated way to act in this way on its own.
This integrity begins to turn into criminal acts, they declare, and then with ironic expressions to the NC strategy: "We seem to be more valuable as in politics, so in the current life to create a name for ourselves than to get out of an anonymity of subhydrous adoption of the names that we have no right to."
The case of Liliane Bettencourtov : François-Marie Banier will be condemned for a disuse of weakness.
On Friday, the Court in Nanterre decided to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banira and to judge whether he used the state of the weakness of the 80 billion billion to prepare her for a part of her detention, whereby her daughter Liliana Bettencourt was guilty.
Photograph (62 years), known by its famous photographs, will be sentenced on 15 and 16 April 2010 for a disuse of weakness, which is a criminal action for which the penalty is recorded in a maximum of 3 years and a penalty of EUR 375 000.
This Decision confirms that the process will be running in the case that can be marked as a family victory of one of the most richest family in France, in which the mother and her daughter are attacked and fighting the management of the Cosmetic Empire L'Oréal.
Furthermore, the 15th Court also ordered a medical investigation in 87 years of Liliana Bettencourt to conduct a college of three doctors.
L'Oreal's heritage and main actor refused to submit such investigations, not, of course, for the submission of the national representatives offered in Nanterre during the investigation.
Physicians who will be chosen on Friday should prepare a report by 10 March 2010 and also express whether Lilian Bettencourt could be taken into the state of weakness and during the period.
I think he's gonna get her down.
I'm talking about her, he announced after the hearing of Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kieman.
In the case of the lawyer Françoise Bettencourtov-Meyers, Oliviera Metzner, this decision welcomed the Court.
It's a good news. Experts will show that with this old lady who is protecting, he's manipulated (M. Banier).
There are two years that the only daughter of Liliana Bettencourt started a criminal proceeding against François-Marie Banier, the photographs and allumbers who are guilty that he has used the state of the weakness of her mother in order to gain a billion euros in the form of shocks, contracts on life insurance or images of the masters.
Therefore, Liliane Bettencourt rejected that it would be manipulated by a photograph that he considers a friend.
While the court had to judge the right of the complaint given to Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the Court of Justice with a time changed at the family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer presented three letters that his customer sent to her notebook (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) and expressed her disloyalty to the wife of François Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter of 2003, Lilian Bettencourt adds, according to a lawyer, "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for 15 years once and twice daily.
Since she gave her, I could never talk to Françoise."
The State Representative in Nanterre re-considered that the complainant's negotiation was not authorised, and that the supervisory judge in these days refused her request for the initiation of procedures to issue legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt's fully able to reach the court, is not protected or in caution.
Nobody else to act for her," confirmed the prosecution representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers would be issued in the time of initiation of the process.
Administrative revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
Nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intellectuals was unusual...
For more than ten years in the management of large companies against the employees with fire access to users before the marketing revolution, it is that the employees should comply with the "values" designed from the top, as before, when they needed to introduce products from the heads of manufacturing technicians.
As a customer became the center of business companies, the marketing revolution compared the marketing strategy to obtain the market with the right direction... and when authoritary efforts to introduce products, different from customer preferences, are regularly returned!
Pasi’s access to employees can lead to demoralization.
Suicide in France Telecom, PSA or Renault firms are only a visible part of a much greater general phenomenon that contains mainly manager codes.
This demobilization affects increasingly the development of all intellectual society, including research and development, and what is more important, economic intelligence.
In fact, the EI "requires... active access and ability to predict" from all participants and requires the employees commitments that are completely contrary to the income of authoritary management.
That is why we call for a manager revolution that should have the goal of introducing work into the business interest center as the customer.
Relati_ the benefit of the internal investigations of public opinion.
Internal investigations of public opinion - as a questionnaire submitted to the employees of Orange - contribute to the revolution in manager procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid no one.
Mostly because I've already convinced myself that the face in the face of the newness is going to be a structure after different divisions, primarily to... what she did!
In addition, because authorisation, as one of the pathology of power, is increasing with the coverage of its own failures.
And finally, because the majority of the leaders' work has a simple view of human behavior.
Because they are high schools for engineers, they have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
The idea's pleasantness wins an old behaviorist theory, currently revived "neuroconscience" from the United States and broadly spread without any more knowledge of the institutions and media.
With the possibility of moving "with" (sic) managers involved, he showed the recent Ipsos Agency investigation on Figaro.fr pages, which only confirms the management work in their position of mechanical management, inadequate for today's world.
Increase and measure the factors of mobilisation.
Instead, the manager revolution is necessary for the proper function of modern enterprises, it assumes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It is based on all purposes and practices of management : For employees, the commitments against the company may only be possible if they appear to be a ́a ́clock to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of the motivation of employees will only be killed in the study Motivation analysis.
These studies showed that they evaluated their enterprises on the basis of a detailed doxy, which will enable them to evaluate what they offer to achieve their live objectives.
The identification and measuring of these mobilization factors can be controlled, predicted and anticipated by the management of human resources on the right road.
This creates a living ground for the development of solid and effective economic intellectuals.
A declaration from Osla: "The Just War" Obama served praise on the right side.
The American rights welcomed the statement Barack Obama before it in Osla, satisfied with the fact that Nobel's peace price for 2009 was held by the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who first had assessed the grant of the price of Obam on October 9 this time, including Sarah Palins, were the former candidates to the Vice-President in the elections in 2008.
I liked what he said, Palin, the Museum of the right Republican wheel, for the US Today journal, and added that she was "necessary" in her memories that are just growing up to this subject.
War is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to have to work, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to stay there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his preacherGeorge W. Bush, justified the sending of forces in Osla on Thursday, and used the proof to explain his decision to send another 30 000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
The next Obam's counterfeit, Newt Gingrich, assessed that the president took a very good job in Osla.
I think the statement was really very good, blessed by the former president of the Sneemous representatives, who appreciated the change of the president's "existence of evil in the world".
In my way, I thought this statement was completely historical, and Gingrich announced during the discussion in the "The Takeaway" series.
The former lawyer, which some believe as a potential Republican candidate in the elections of the president for 2012, was expected to see the "levitic President" to remind the members of the Nobel Price Committee " that they would not be free and could not deliver the price for peace if the use of forces did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, the former author of George W. Bush, now editor of Washington Post, Obama presented "very American statement".
Not only as a "global community", but "he spoke as a American president" and reminded the Europeans that they lived in a safe bubble that they did not themselves, and that they did not do too much to keep it," Gerson assessed.
Among the few insatisfactors from a series of rights belong to the Bush Earth Earth, the former walletman of the United Nations John Bolton, who expressed a "unified, uninspired and without inspiration", as he said on the National Review Online websites.
To the left of the president, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is scared in view of Barack Obam, justifying the use of force.
"When we put war into the pack of justice, we can easily prevent the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the medium-level print remains a glorious position against the president.
Although Los Angeles Times continues to consider the payment of the price of the peace of Obam as a preliminary, he assessed his output as "advice" and it also for a speaker known as his talent.
The declaration from Osla should serve as a guide to the international decision in the solution of conflicts, in the fight against poverty and attack," the Californian newspaper is depressed.
Obama, "he made a statement which was necessary", assessed New York Times, and the expression indicated "for simple and educative".
Road transporter: three maratons to a agreement that saves the delivery of the resources on Christmas.
After three marathons acting, the TRF and the only organization of employees remained until the end, on Friday evening to the agreement, which ended the challenge to the staff and threat that was over the delivery of Christmas resources.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, during the Friday signing of the agreement, issued "freeness" after a number of negotiations that began in the middle of the agreement.
After the second night, the negotiators will discuss on Friday soon with the view that the version of the Agreement will be signed as soon as at the end of the afternoon.
Yet, three employees organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have been dismissed from the negotiation.
But there was a need for more than six hours of meeting that started at 11 hours to all agree and 18 hours to sign the agreement.
This conflict would "seem very hurt to businesses" and "will threaten the danger of breaking the feasts at the end of the year", Bussereau declared.
The text text contains an increase in the amount of 4% in the lowest payments (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% in the highest payments (international transport).
The hour payment for the lowest payments shall be increased from 8.72 EUR to 9.06.
It's not much, but it's a lot of effort, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Today we're ordering our members not to block the blocks, no blocks of resources center.
But there can be more than a few opposers who are not peaceable, "added.
Philippe Grillot, President TLF, welcomed "the correct agreement", even though it was difficult to admit an increase in high payments as regards the international competition. "
Accordingly, 170 euros per month will be increased in the lowest averages and 100 to 120 euros in the highest.
It is a healthy understanding agreement and respect for employees, declared CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "heso-contract".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also proposes revalorisation of travel expenditure at 3% and a report on the status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also enable to address the question of 13 payments and the modernisation of collective composition.
Bussereau recalled "super 100 million euros on taxes from business payments" which was the subject of the change in government law to us for the budget for 2009, which was voted on Thursday to Friday the National Conference.
The Government requires the Senate to vote "conform" vote.
The signature allows this Agreement to apply first to enterprises which are members of this organization, in the case of the enlargement of the Ministry of Work.
The consequence "in the shortest termin," Bussereau dismissed.
The whole process can only disappoint the unconcorded organization of employees.
The FNTR organisation is talking about "bad trade" because 100 million euros "which was offered to the sector in the compensation of a part of carbon tax."
The State Secretary for Transport has invited us to negotiate the emergency, not as a result of a mutual analysis, but to avoid breaking the rocks in the nearest holiday holidays, the Unostra moved.
For the organization of the other, the agreement will be threatened in the next 12 months "to bury a large amount of small and medium-sized enterprises from the campaign".
RER A: Transport interruption for weekend, committees are not satisfied with the RATP carrier.
The interruption of transport on the line of RER A, which is the largest town transport line in France, will also continue during the weekend, since the Friday negotiation between the committees and the RATP management of the second day of the staff has not led to any specific outcome in the question of the premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, then, the days of the important purchase weekend before Christmas, the trains will be driven only between 10 and 20 hours, on the main range ( between La Defence and Nation) will drive each other train, outside this area only one of the four.
The SNCF connection will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and the travellers will so be forced to stop another train.
Trade houses Galeries Lafayette, which is expected every day more than 200 000 customers, welcomed the fact that "RaTP tried to ensure the connection with big business houses".
Link RER A leads from the western to east of Paris aglomeration.
The RATP seat is held from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Wednesday, there was one of the two trains in the carriage, and practically no adjustment was eating outside the puzzle, as it was in the plan.
Like on Thursday, the people of Ile de France were organized differently, and he did not control the injury on the stakeholders.
So so soon it was at Saint-Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) a lot less people than usually, otherwise because they missed kids and students.
Jack Nbakin, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he arose about "hours and half earlier to have certainty that he will come on time".
Saint-Lazare's payments were not completed, the SNCF State railway reported, and the highest number of guardians and guards were predicted.
RER A facilities operated SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut came or left from the Saint-Lazare cover with an addition to the metro.
Other Valley meetings will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will evaluate the results of the weekend afternoon meeting with the leadership of the committees as "firm".
The RER leads to negotiations on the special Protocol on the RER A Capital Flags on all pages, the adjustment of work and time, the progress of the career, etc.
However, it does not matter to drivers who require a deserved premium, according to Thierry Garona (Assembly J.).
The RATP has even rejected the claims regarding the premium, which deteriorated from the CGT by "not able to solve the problem, while the travellers and SNCF did it."
At a new meeting, which is planned on Monday, "reexamining the submissions of the application," he explained the RATP transport companies.
What was the reason why the professionals think that the business "works out of weekend traveling pleasures."
At the afternoon, approximately 150 drivers had a business committee in his Paris seat.
Thus, the leadership that afterwards refused any debate during the staff was decided to meet.
It is dangerous that the conflict will also be extended on RER B on Wednesday, after Unsa and independent will announce the stakeholder's preparation.
The committees request a premium from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, from which 30 euros of variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South (Jij), Indépendants (On independence)) and strive to deteriorate work on this line, which transfers a million travellers daily.
The RER Officers shall produce a carriage of 2200 to 2700 euro gross salaries and 600 to 650 euro premiums for an irregular work period and for work on Sunday and holidays.
The Turkish Justice has resolved for the Kurdish party and this decision has a difficult result with herself.
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court decided to revoke the main pro-kurdic parties in the country, which immediately had a protest in the Kurd Community on the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may make a significant complication of the task of the Government who is trying to give the Kurdish community to a friendly hand and try to finish 25 years of conflict.
The Partie for the Democratic Society (DTP) has been solved because it has become "the decline of the activities of the threatening independence of the State and its unpartial units," reporters said the President of the Supreme Court of Hasim Kilic after four days of negotiation.
The decision was adopted uniquely by 11 judges when the party needed seven votes, Kiliç introduced and added that 37 side frames of her President Ahmeta Turkey and ladies Aysely Tuglukov had prohibited political life for five years.
The Court also announced the cancellation of the parliamentary immunity, which Mr Turk and Mrs Tugluc had enjoyed, and the confiscation of the party's ownership in the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP party has 21 Classes in Parliament (from 500).
The leadership of the Party has already warned before the verdict that the lawyers would leave Parliament before they acted in it as Members without political responsibilities.
The decision is to continue the process started in 2007 by the Cascate Court Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of obeying the "commands" of the Working Parties of Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries are viewed as a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is a legal political vitry of rebels from PKK.
The Party assures that it has no "basic connection" with the PKK but refuses to mark it as a terrorist organization and calls for a government to negotiate with it.
The Verdict of the Court comes on the moment when the Government gives the Kurdish Community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and trys to limit the support of the Kurds against the PKK and to end such a conflict.
The DTP leader confirmed that the party's resolution could lead to the renewal of pressure on the south-east of Anatolie, where many demonstrations have been made in the last weeks against the submitts to which the leader of PKK Abdullah Öcalan has been held to the police centres.
From the notification of justice, thousands of demonstrators have been stored before the DTP seat in Diyarbakir, a large city in the south-east, which is mostly Kurds.
The police used the wearing granates and water works, the demonstrators again shot Molotov's cocktails or shot stones from the palms.
It also demonstrated some hundred people in Istanbul.
After the statement of the verdict, Mr Turk stated that justice decision was only "the deterioration of deficiency".
Turkey cannot resolve this question (Kurds, etc.) by the prohibition of the party, reported in pressure.
The Government established by the islamic movement also condemned this decision.
We're from the principle against the distortion of the parties.
It doesn't solve anything, the Minister for Energy Tanner Yildiz announced.
This decision is a complete department of the democratic attacks, which the government has started, commented by the Politologist Ahmet Insel.
We can expect a reaction from the PKK, added.
On Thursday, the PKK was registered to one of the most murdered attacks north Turkey who killed seven soldiers in three days ago.
Snow can come
That's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to shake the citizens, he says the leader of the winter division of the FES Technical Services.
But so that his employees could try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could be the first weekend, according to the horologists.
It is prepared over 300 employees and 120 vehicles to take care of snow and ice.
However, the FES acts in accordance with the precise plan.
Once they snow in Frankfurt completely and the temperatures fall under zero, they come to 20 such appeal A big-sympache, Brauburger explains.
These incidences include the main and travel travel travels such as Newe Street and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the arrivals for actors, the local public transport lines, the areas and the streets with a decrease like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts within three hours.
In the case of need, there is a maximum of three hours to buy a wall of salt that is better holding around 1040 kilometers.
That's why the FES starts in three hours a night, "to be the roads free, until the carrying up to employment."
It's uncomfortable when it snows at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the leader of the winter division of technical services, "for nobody's willing to make the shoppers a place."
First, when so weak, there are a series of communications on arrival and communications, including the Council-Beil-Straße.
The last priority has side and side road.
Brauburger knows they're going to get there.
In five hours, the FES's road will go, mainly dangerous places and transitions will be cleaned.
FES can't take care of all cyclose.
In Frankfurt, there is a special service that follows from 22 to 4.30 primarily, says Brauburger.
Since the ledge is created on them, the weapons go forth immediately as soon as the temperature falls under two degrees.
In the case of need, they're called by the police too.
Dinosaur collapses
Tawa hallae seemed to be associated with other dinosaures: the animal was two metres long and 1,50 metres high, running after two strong back-coats, had a long-term leaf with a stinged, slow teeth, short fronts with sleeve trees and a long ocas.
If this kind lived for a few million years after, it would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the Texas in Austin and colleagues in the quarter magazine Science writes that Tawa Hallae was but one of the first dinosaures with these physical characters.
The animal lived approximately 215 million years ago in the New Mexico today, which was at the same time in the suck of the supercontinent of Pange.
Tawa opens a new window to earlier evolution of dinosaures, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot of neighborhoods, extensions and known early dinosaures.
In 2006 Nesbitt and other paleontologists started in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes, on one day, we found twelve dinosaures of bones, which is not known for trias, informs the member of the Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones identifyed men as a new species.
They collected the rest of five units during the sepulchre.
Find confirms the theory of the early history of dinosaures.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Indians Hopi.
For Sterling Nesbitta, it's an unusual finding: "The phosphosphysics of the trias are very rare, often they'll find only single cells."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this injury without exemption.
Especially sensitive this finding is not, but confirms some theory about the early history of dinosaures, perhaps Martin Sander from the University of Bonna.
According to the current view, dinosaurers first discovered about 230 million years ago.
With the oldest phosphilies, it is not complete, therefore the adding of predinosaur is a very difficult thing.
Experts discuss, for example, when they are still divided into three most important lines of development: the mass-food terapeuticals, which later belonged to Tyranosaurus king, Velociraptor and birds, the fourth sauropodice and their family, and the nature of Ornithischia (Ptakopan), for example Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa Hallae is after Nesbita analysis and his colleagues are therapy.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the Tawa Hallae Leb, researchers, for example, found evidence of air vacuums, which also have the beauty of the birds.
The breathing of birds is more efficient than the sugars.
At Tawa Hallae, even the bones of the coat were apparently filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most priority teropode with air vacuums, says Randall Irmis.
Since the family lines of huge sauropods had also late air vacuums and light bones, this useful innovation was probably a common front of both groups.
At least three waves in North America
Since the most primary dinosaures lived in South America yet, the exporters were exporting that they were still in the first place.
According to this, three lines of development have been divided soon and spread from South America to all continents that, then, as supercontinent Pange, have made a single earthquake.
It would also say that the team found the rest of two others with Tawa Hallae, not especially the poor family terapeuts.
These three can't be buried from one common, immigrated forefathers argument.
We believe that it has occurred at least three-year-old whales in North America, says Alan Turner from American Museum of Natural History in New York, together with a study.
Of course, there is also a resolution.
One other older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of the most difficult dinosaures, lives in Poland today, says the bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give dohromades a drawn image because there remained very many primitive dinosaur phosphilies in South America, while the remaining continents are rarely found.
As the dinosaures have shown that a relatively rare sideline of plasma species has developed to governing land operators during the middle of the earth, it remains a deceived.
During the trias, dinosaures shared their live space with many other beaches, such as the predecessors of today’s crocodiles and flying hairs and without numbering other jackets.
About the end of the tria, dinosaures spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while the family died and spread trias and jury.
The history of success failed
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It could have reached the mass measurement, which Dinosaur's overlide accidentally, but not the beaches.
Or the dinosaures have better adjusted, so they could exhaust competition.
The history of success wasn't everyone fully.
About 150 million years later, he helped a different group of animals, who also developed in triason and lived in shadow since that time: the swimming.
Solidarity from Vienna after Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatures are international.
Professors are on the list: Toronto, of Cambria, Witness universities or Berkeley in California.
They connected to Neapol, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paul, Berlin or Brem.
The police settlement of the obsessed casino of the French Goethe University was concerned about the world's destruction.
278 professors and teachers of Goeth's universities, but also high schools throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America solidarize with protesting students in the Westend campus.
In the statement by German and English, the President "not "approved" by the police officer.
Because the walls and artistic works were disturbed, the University President Werner Mâer-Estler left the building that were conceived last week by students and advertising.
On the other hand, five students were hurt.
The damage of the things, the signators, does not justifie "the violent release of self-organized students and teachers of the police orders".
The decline represents "unacceptable principle" for the freedom of research and existence.
The relief to vandalism serves to "injustice and criminalization of protest" and takes attention from the contents.
Presidency has cancelled the necessary discussion.
Preventing calls to stop criminal proceedings.
It states that the majority of existing people did not support any damage.
Authorized Protection
Verdi and the German Community of Affairs are also solidarized with students.
Protest is a legitimate expression that grows anxiety about its own future, says the secret earthly youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hesen Ministry of Eve Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has yet followed the procedure of the university president and police.
We're grateful to the University President.
Destruction and occupation are completely inacceptable, said on Thursday in the Current Stunde (Current Hour) in the Weisbaden's earthly snow.
We have a understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of the vandalism, said the leader of the earthly dream for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, they saw the SPD, Green and Links' opposition fractions.
The CDU takes the slow walls for a criminalization of protest, said Janine Wissler.
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of students, there was a claim.
Linke delivered us, who invites the Minister inside to submit a report on the police settlement.
New Silicon-Valley
For a long time, it was payable for a secret city that was not accessible for visits from the West.
Greenograd, one of the ten periods of Moscow's main city, in the Soviet Swazi, was a closely guarded locality where a secret army research was conducted.
Today, this period is considered with 216 000 inhabitants, a distance of 37 km from the Moscow center, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres located here.
Since September 2008, the Greenhouse representatives have contacted the French Deck Centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several visits and signed in the middle of Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol of Hard Cooperation".
The Russian delegation led the Moscow majority of Jurij Rosljak and the prefect from the Greenograd Anatolij Sēnov, who signed for Frankfurt the leader reporter for the planning of Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, the representatives of the FIZ and the small and medium-sized enterprises will be conducted by natural scientific research at the seminar in Greenograd.
Scientific exchange
It's about the turnover of the deck.
It also refers to economic relations.
The FIZ firms will be allowed to catch on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian companies want to get orders in Germany.
Greenograd is a seat of significant Russian research institutions and companies.
They need to belong to the Moscow electronic technology establishment, a large concern of Sitronics and Russian Elektronica.
The period was founded in 1958 as a "socialistic planned city" for weapons research.
Greenograd (the literal translation "Green City") obtained its name according to the landscape in which research equipment are located.
Stuttgart Speed
The size of Stuttgart 21 is not ready enough.
For the project beneficiaries, it is simply "new heart of Europe".
All right. S21 is more than the launch of instructions, more than the monstrous building that is at the main city of Badenska-Württemberska for a decade in a lost building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 80s.
The main stations with railways that ended in the center of the city were then considered a transport-technical phosil of the 19th century, which act as rapidly modern railways, because there was a very much time to overcome the locomotive backwards.
Busy, I'm gonna stop, go on -- so it should work.
That's why the heads are mixed: in Frankfurt and Mnich.
And in Stuttgart: transitional instructions, which are about half the road of the trans-European railway directors between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, therefore the slogan of "Europe's heart".
It is actually started with S21, although visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with.
The very ambitional projectors themselves knew that the start of the building in Hessen and in the Bavarian Great County is almost unfinancial.
Since there are modern hydrocarbons with motor vehicles and drivers on both sides, they have no main reliefs on the problem of improving and exiting.
However: Stuttgart 21 starts a very new ICE trace in Ulma.
The earthly and communal policies have sentenced it.
The roads cooperate, even because the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic is a tax charger and not a state counterpart.
Urbanisticly, the project can be apologized in a way otherwise.
There will be a new city space that - if we believe the computer images of projectors - will include a lot of green.
For the railway transport system, S21 is damaged.
Transitional resources and trate building are intended for personal transport, which - typically in the 80s - has been added to a huge growth.
Then there was no competition in the floods.
Modern transport policy must, however, go first to strengthen cost transport, because railway transport is far more ecological than cost cars on the road.
But the new tragedy is not due to the low-leaving steps suitable for costs.
More important is that S21 is directly touching many other railway projects.
There were six billion euros to be buried in Sweden.
It's an official number.
Experts are considered real ten to 15 billion.
It is evident that in the next decade, there will be no financing for further portfolio points and nice network places.
There are sixty-first projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the building of about 180 kilometers of the long road through the Rina valley.
Since 1987, it has been made a slow time on this road.
There'd be a need to be worthwhile.
But S21 will be so quick.
The road of the Rina valley becomes a hair of international cost transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The Government shall examine the decision on aircraft
The Earth Government has been opened in the Western Snow of Wiesbaden if it is against the Court of Justice of Hessen (VGH) on the prohibition of nights and let it be revised.
Coalice CDU/FDP granted experts to legally examine more than 400 pages of VGH, said the Ministry of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel today wrote that it would have to re-modify the Night Prohibition of the flight in the case of a planned northwest ranvage of the French airport.
The authorisation of 17 years between 23 and 5 hours, as the Earth Government assumes, does not comply with the law of the protection of the population against the night aircraft.
Coal must be decided by 4 January if it will require a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticized this department and demanded the Government's representative to address the revision of the Social Administration Court in Libya.
The SPD Fraction Boss Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invited CDU and FDP to return to the promises about the prohibition of nights that she gave before the choice. Otherwise it is possible to be assessed as "break of the word".
It's damnly difficult if you can keep your word, the leader of the Green Tarek Al-Wazir said in the ship of the FDP optional slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the expression of Schäfer-Gümbel, the earthly government is trying to get to its night-flights by "transfering rights and tricks".
Exact legal control is his time.
Koalice doesn't want to work on the basis of "the first income".
We need realistic decisions, said Stefan Mıer (FDP).
His fractions for the prohibition of nights were never like the opposition.
American banks paying aid
America, the crises of the gross banks are discharged by the state paths.
Bank of America paid aid in the average from the Tarp Bank Reserve Fund for a total of $45 billion (approximately $30 billion).
According to the report of the American station NCBC, the Citigroup also plans to pay State aid.
The constitutions so want to leave the restriction to accept money - limitation of bonus payments to the managers and refunds of high taxes.
Bank of America has been acquired in investors thanks to changed obligations well 19 billion dollars of pure money.
The rest of the amount was taken from its stock, which was filled outside otherwise by the sales of the branches.
Kenneth Lewis' bank boss in the middle of the evening expressly thanked the American taxer: The money injection helped us to overcome a difficult time.
The monetary establishment harmed the financial crisis on the top of the bank by taking Merrill Lynch's investment bank.
Citigroup wants to be released from its obligations against the State by providing money on the market.
The NCBC informed the resources that this American bank could have been able to notify the increase of approximately 20 billion dollars on Thursday.
The speaker Citigroup didn't want to do it.
In June, the Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley have already been helped.
Quick Option
It was just more than waiting.
The station presented the representative only two weeks after the ZDF Governing Board extracted from the Office of Chefredator Nikolaus Brender.
Yesterday night, the grammium wanted to agree with that person.
Peter Frey, the leader of ZDF study in the main town in Berlin, was marked as a favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially not to overcome the process.
However, the role could also be that they did not want to damage ZDF Markuse Schächter's inhibitor if this would not have passed by the Governing Board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, supports nine of the 14 members of the gram.
The voting outcome was not known before the conclusion of this issue.
Two weeks ago, he spent in the Governing Board of Schächter with his opinion to continue with Nikolaus Brender for the next five years.
For Brender, only seven members were voted, seven were against him.
The EU's administration Council has also signaled a few weeks ago the election that it does not want to confirm Brender in the Office.
The opposite against the shepherd organised the Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused further detention in the Office of the highly-determined chairman by the argument that Brender had decreased the monitoring quota of ZDF reporting.
Thus, until a short time before the election, protests were criticized by the political impact on the ZDF.
Consequently, in the debate, even 35 national laws who value the Coach's procedure as an anti-degradation.
It wasn't for anything.
About
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, my pedagogics and my romantics.
Then he worked for Southwest and Frankfurter's view.
1983, Frey went to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Next station: 1988 to 1990 a personal reporter of the shepherd; 1991/92 a letter in Washington; to 1998 the leader and moderator of the "Morgenmagazins"; to 2001 the leader of ZDF policy; since that time the leader of ZDF.
After Brender, who was chosen in the middle of a professional periodic of Medium Magazine a journalist of the year, the meeting, announced Green that they gave a constitutional complaint.
Love’s anti-candidate in the Governing Board, Russian-Falc Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that social countries should modify the ZDF state association so that the personal charges of the in-balance could not be blocked with politically motivated.
Beck, however, also refused to remove partial policies from the ZDF Supervisory Council.
Brender's supposed representative Peter Frey recommended a smart shock-sheet - unless Brender's meeting criticised for this strong gram.
Thanks to this evidence of reporting independence, he could nominate him to the place of the shepherds without loss of faces as well as Schächter, so he could be released by the Governing Board, without being suspicious that the party would be sent to the office.
In the lateral arithmetic, Frey is so close to the left liberals.
Haram's freedom
Partial success for students: After the year of establishment, the Ministers of Culture finally entered on Thursday in the Spanish Country: In the Ministry of Culture and High School Directors, both parties agreed that it was the will of improving studies for bacteria and magistrates.
Students should be able to carry out their study in the future.
In particular, it was agreed to reduce the burden by tests: In general, each study module should be completed once.
Furthermore, the work of students should be revised, and it should be ensured "real and famous peace".
Policy and high schools want to simplify the recognition of tests between high schools in Germany and foreign.
Member States are committed to create more flexible structural tasks for bacteria and magazine studies.
Earth derogations should stop existing.
Lower tests
From the beginning of the student protests in June, Ministers of Culture and University Rectors had clear words about better study in the mouth.
Now they're first filled with specific areas.
The calling Accreditation Council concluded that the number of tests of parts of drasticks are reduced: "Each module will actually be completed only once," it is written in a 30-page report, which is partly to regulate the approval of studies.
"Much lower test burden," said the President of the Accreditation Council of Reinhold Grimm, "the mistakes must be stopped, which has extremely limited the graduation of the study."
To that end, it must be "successfulness of study" in the future "decisive criteria" in the implementation.
Modules and contents " must be firmly checked" to "no limitation of students at the election
Seminars."
Students should have a "commit to a space that allows and supports its own initiative".
The rules should be paid by approval of new studies, after review, but also for existing studies.
This is needed to "reaccredit" every five years – which, however, means that it will take up until 2015 before all studies will be checked.
These are responsible for ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation Councils established by social countries.
Cultural Ministers invited the "social" country in October to act on the agencies so that it was not too big and the test regime is not too strict.
In individual countries, universities and high schools have already agreed with the Territory Ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country has yet promised the additional initiative of the Portuguese-Falc for further development of the Bolonic process.
High schools of money should mainly play conservation programmes and study advice, and strengthen experimental and foreign authorities.
They want countries and high schools to charge ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to give to Parliament a new high school law.
It states that only one single test should be required to finish the study module.
Study training should be even more flexible, to ensure recognition of tests from other high schools and to facilitate access to the director.
All studies in the country should be checked by the end of the next year.
Governments and oppositions re-considered studies in the country on Thursday.
Along with the praise, the criticism of the resolution was also fallen.
The Social Representative of High School Groups, Juso, invited the creation of educational policies not to be discovered in the future of "without closed doors" ministers and high school directors.
Latestly after the station, students should "to speak at least a word" also as a person concerned.
The future academics also received support from the president of High School Directors (HRK), Margrety Wintermantel: "We need student experience", said on Thursday on a meeting with the Ministry of Culture, with which HRK was discussed on the common reform report.
According to the Committees of Education and Education (GEW) the Bonn Resolution was not sufficiently far away: they require a legal sentence that would enable each individual with a bacalian title access to a constitutional teacher study.
Secondly, social countries have to ensure that there are enough places available tomorrow for today's generation of bacteria students in the studio areas with the best studies, said the member of the GEW Andreas Keller.
Society countries have to work far more transferred.
But the Culture Ministers did not focus on free access to the magister programs.
More than a note under the boat to Herta Mâer
To get to Germany and out there is a nice, almost no control..." the introduction line of Werner Sünner's basic basic basic, which is the subject of the experience of a dissident who has received freedom in this exhibition of language.
Werner Sōner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banata, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bukurešti, and posted as a lector of a child’s kidney lattership, and 1982 moved to Frankfurt over Mohan.
Sōner was described by different literary prices, 1993 was transferred by poetry at the Legendary French Goethe University, and since 2002 he was the leader of the Hessen Fora in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A significant microliterary distortion was made on Wednesday on one seminar in Mnich, on which the "Germany" was in Romania in the mirror and the broad view of its security acts.
Obviously, the disappointed and infected Sōner left a statement in which the Romanian writers, Richard Wagner, William Totoke, Franz Hodjak and Helmut Frauendorfer, are recognized to cooperate as a secret informator of the Roman Secret Service of Security.
Along with some of the presents, Söder got the German language price in 1989.
Increasingly started the convergence, first in 1971.
I am, Sünner continued, "that was someone who didn't care enough of trying to scare the Security side."
The warner Werner Sünner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the granting of Nobel's price of Herta Mâer and its unexpected literary arrangements with the mechanisms of the Dictatoral Government, and in particular the community of German authors who are buried from Romania, is deteriorated by the case that indicates the depth and shame of the political system based on control and spicing.
Werner Sünner isn't, at least if it can be said according to the accurate state of knowledge, but it's only a coach, but it's also a victim.
In the Security Acts, the secret agent Walter's role played, said after Michael Markel's recognition and refused to affect himself by Walter's secret agent.
"Then he's stuck me in all the basic points," says Markel.
He has moral obligation to do this note.
The declaration of the speaker was in this form and before this public was unexpected, but the recognition of the former disident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not completely surprising.
Herta Mıer wrote already in July when she read her own acts, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant booking for spikes Security.
The investigation, it can be assumed, will speculate, and in some cases, as well as the name is hidden by the crying name Sorin, Voice and Walter.
Otherwise than in the foreign, while a very certain review of the Stazi ingredient, the manipulation with the remainder of the Security control is still very difused.
In the past years, the systematic light was mature and limited.
One of the Birthler Offices, which corresponds to the National Council to the processing of Security (CNSAS), was first established in 1999, has been issued more longer since that time.
Since 2005, there is a law governing the management of documents.
That the former members of the Security have still a great impact in Romania, he introduced a discussion in which one of the former Security boss from the Temeshvara issued a refusal evaluation carrier.
His psychology says, finally, it was only heard once.
The potential confirmation was completely uncovered in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, in the case of Sōner, as well as in relation to the slaughtered offence, there are inevitable questions.
The special reaction of listeners to Sünner's recognition allows us to expect that the continuation of this holiday will determine the desire to be determined more than after the adding of the wine and the study.
For the geneze of Herty Mâer's work, who accepted Nobel's price yesterday, it's more than a note under the star.
Hard Champions League income
It seemed as if a purely dressed trade representative from a divorced holiday party on which the manufacturer of the sports goods of sweetness was sold when he entered the fourth hours after half night into the called mercedes C class C new trainer VfBr Christian Gross in the delivery of the sponsor's oral coloured piece.
A man with a marvelous dance was allowed to carry him in another city.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol wasn't in the game, and the drunken lucky was a 55-year-old man also a little.
It was a good evening, but tomorrow he'll continue working.
Or it just takes it.
The words of the employed Switzerland at the first three days: "We have reached the ocmifinals", which is in Champions League thanks to the warmth3:1 over the Urziceni Union from Romania, "but we can't let us succeed: it will be brutally strong fight against the construction."
"The far more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the execution from the king's class and in the ordinary ligue days in Mouchi.
And avoid renewed clear weaknesses after three Maricy (5.), Träsche (8) and Pogrebnyaka (11).
Losing
Osmifinal Champions League (conditions 16./17. + 23./24 February/ advocate 9.10. + 16./17 March) will be lost in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel’s tremendous approach will therefore be maintained.
Not only in a genuine medical that added to the infinite Stuttgart professionals during a short time of self-consciousness, willingness to sat down and joy of games.
I went to the players, and I told them that they had to focus on their strong pages and I asked them to be more courageous, explained the medical of the soul Gross so simplely deceive a successful reception, which, but for the action of Babbel's therapy, did not show any more.
He reflected a certain magic, admitted Babbel's designer Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in Balabe, there are some things that you wouldn't think likely."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a multi-day stop caused of hurt, became his dynamic immediately the best player at the spell, tried to describe the founded "fenomen" with the words "free" and the work of the procedures of the new overseer: "It's a man who is radical and requires discipline.
That's what we're currently doing."
This was obviously missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns President Horst Heldt
The VFB Stuttgart's more stealing.
As Gross, players and managers do not want to appreciate the victory against the weak replacement and the entirely heavy defence of the Roman host.
They would also win in Glasgow before a terrible wake after destruction 0:4 in Leverkusean, Khedir considers.
And sports, President Horst Heldt, reminded that although one goal was achieved in the sight, the other is still far.
We're not behind water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after the first victory after three months, it was caused by weekend events, who were purely lived in the form of television conversation with Jens Lehman's officer quickly before the start of the storage.
There's a decision that acts other than Jens, he responsed Heldt to Lehman's critical force.
He predicted the representation of the weak lead and decided to change the trainer after the pressure of pubertal fans.
Even when he was canceled his free day after the bathroom, Lehmann marked as a sign of missing sovereignty and dependence.
Lehman's expressions "formulated pure egoism", he revealed Heldt and announced the consequences for the officer.
Both fourteen people will have no joy in life.
Everyone is too different with the finals that without the work of a collected training team, it would not be so strong and fightable players.
Babbel and his assistants had a "great share in success," they said Heldt and Lehmann on the basis of a single vote - and a man with an igelite chain agreed.
The subject of the world’s magicity in a difficult weight
Injurious dual in Bern: Kevin Johnson's prosecutor continued to provoke words and gestures of the world Master of Vitalia Klicz.
However, after twelve strong rounds, the Ukrainian took his title in a difficult weight of the WBC boxer organization.
The judge of decisions was a single vote.
Hamburg - Vitalia Click remains a world master in a box in a hard weight.
The 38-year WBC champion struck the night on the Sabbath in Bern America Kevin Johnson on a single vote (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klikka, this is the third successful deal of the title after its return in October 2008.
Earlier, the Ukrainian was two times a world master of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen to those who were all expected.
The call improved his balance on 39 victories in 41 professional consequences, twice he was hurt due to damage.
The caller Johnson was first killed in the 24th ambassador.
Before approximately 17,000 birds in Bern arena, he drived 2,02 meters high Click a band mainly with his left.
About 11 meters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Click Ear, but was downloaded before the ears of the world's master, so Click couldn't make a decisioning worm with his dangerous right.
That's what Johnson made to the caller a little bit and just tried to get into the other rounds.
Although the call caused words and gestures, his walls, but the master of the world just a little bit.
But it's just the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who struggled with Click with twelve rounds.
The caller took care of breaking in the main city of Switzerland before the battle.
He hurt the Click as a "reverse zombies" that "not right."
During the weight on Friday, the shampion went out, he dropped Johnson from the nose of the sun brain, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Click Return
The call remained unexpected after its return on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of breaking, he struck Samuel Peter in Berlin in Nigeria and took out his "she" wheel WBC, who had to take away before it without fighting.
In this year, he struck in the campaigns of Juan Carlose Gomeze from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
In this camp, I only got one and physically, in a good form, I've made the Click back to the ring.
His dream remains, but all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the master of the world of WBO and IBF.
WBA's wearing but Brit David Haye, after he sat on November from the throne 2,13 metres high of Nikolay Vulajev.
Haye rejected the fight against Click in the summer, which was planned in September.
It is evidently planning his promoting company against Click at the London Wembley Stadium.
The case of Kun\z
The main attack from opposition: The Chief of the Green Jürgen Trittin signed for bad information about the affair of Kun's Defense Minister of Guttenberg for lies.
SPD and Linke (Le日) calls the office to explain.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest announcements to the attack on Kun, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defense of Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has allowed a household claim.
The Minister for Death Bombing two cisters in September said "consciously false," the leader of the Green Jürgen Trittin said in the Saturday reporting order ARD "Tageshow".
Let's call it a cloud expression: Lhal.
The order to kill was issued in the non-compliance with the rules of international security support forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the basis of the news that the NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Wednesday, it was revealed that the attack was only on the destruction of the charged cars, but on the target killing of two Taliban leaders.
At the American attack, which the German Commander Kun·zu, Colonel Klein, requested to kill or hurt up to 142 people, was held by NATO.
Green, SPD and Linke invited Angela Merkel's college office on Saturday to make it up immediately before the Summit and also explained what Guttenberg had done about this event.
Mrs. Merkel must explain whether the strategy for the purpose of killing is part of the Afghanistan Social Policy - and if the Office of the Office, Bundeswehr and the rapporteur service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and the colleague of the Green Renate Künst.
Ulrich Wilhelm's speaking government denied the criticism.
The Office of the Office has no effect on the specific Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, said.
On Saturday, the vote of doubts on the counting of the Ministry on the background of the release of the General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenberg were correctly and completely informed about the attack on the cisterns.
It was officially indicated that they had to support the existence of NATO communications and shut down sensitive details to the Minister.
However, from the surroundings of both top officials, they had warned the Defense Minister for Affairs for a number of reports, including the bilateral document of Major Colonel Klein and one of the military police reports.
"Frankfurter Generaler Sonntags Zeitung" reports that Wichert had to request in a letter to explain.
It is said he hasn't received any answer yet.
The Ministry did not vote on Sabbath and pointed out that this would be resolved in the Research Committee on Social Snow, which will be established in the next centre.
The world of dreams
Some see the images in a careful state and hear voices that the finals do not see and do not hear.
Not only psychologically sick or in drug-conjunction, the border between imagination and anxiety.
As soon as it comes to sleep, everything's fine.
We're locked with the closed eyes in our dark room, we're moving to be surrounded with the most beautiful ideas and fantastic overwhelming.
But whoever lives in the watch of dream, sees and hears things that endlessly do not see and do not hear, pays in the western world a lot for foolish or drug dependent, or at least as a strange.
However, such images and voices are not only in the psychiatrics of sick or in drugs.
The same neuronal processes that allow us to place houses, to draw images or to write Romans are here and there to make sure that the limits between dreams, imagination and lusts are crossed.
The dreams changed status can be produced in different images, in the best case we call them vision, in worst blades.
Although the initiator and the initiator can be different, however, the mysteries of Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlose Castanedy, the shamanic states of blows, psychosis and hallucination can be removed from similar processes.
Halucinations or visions will occur if the equality of neuronal brain transmissioners - mainly dopamine, norradrenaline, serotonine and acetylcholin - and interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complicated hallucinations and bleeding thoughts are very often produced in schizofren psychosis.
Gravity is not too much over him.
The association between blue and dream was employed by philosophy and physicians from ancient times.
Aristoteles understood the hallucination as a form of dream in a safe state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, found in 1861 "a great similarity of blowing with dreams," for Sigmund Freud was even a dream of "psychosis, with all insensitiveness, overallness, injury."
It's 2001, Henning T. changes into comics.
His body is bilateral and crystally colored.
Gravitation has no power over him, it's up at the room street.
It feels tough.
Following him, he's stumbled with bloody red grims, cutting teeth.
He follows him, he's buried into hard, fire-boots, he's hit with him on the wall, he feels pain on the whole body.
Voices, bad voices are threatened from walls and from lusts.
He can't breathe the voices that he gives him and hurt.
Henning T. takes two cabs out of the stereo, gets them into the swimming and puts it up on the rock.
He's stuck on one player, and he's getting a knife around his leg.
Shut up.
The smiley's allowing.
Learn, with the voices of the congregation, carrying his bubines, "Go to the clinic and let it be treated!"
Today, Henning T. 40 years old, he lived six acute psychosis, last two years ago, first nearly 20 years ago.
The LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is schizoafecti and paranoic psychosis, other than maniodepressive, take medicines against depression, mania, schizofrenia.
He learned to live with his sickness, he's married for three years.
I lived the worst fear and the deepest doubts in psychology, he says.
Examples are terrible
Approximately one percent of people are sick at least once for the life of schizophenia, in psychiatric clinics it is the most frequently treated disease after depression.
In acute shizofrene psychosis, they can no longer distinguish the internal and external world, enough to a survived condition that can lead to hallucination, size, related illusion or dilution illusion.
Especially extended is hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or lead dialogues.
Not even optical hallucinations are unusual.
It is not able to distinguish significantly from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter destructive signals, the income has been broken.
Like the dream opens psychotics, the ideas and fantasies that are buried from the deepest layers of the domain.
Reality in psychology is focused on an entity, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, the top doctor of the General Psychiatry University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Sch ́frenik is located in the center of action, everything has a significance related to it.
In addition, it gets into the pass roll, becomes, like in the dream, powerful events and can't form them actively.
As a result, Sch’frenica often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not the most possible in them, the prospects are terrible, the wake up.
Once for life to live hallucination
Other than in the dream, says Fuchss, "the mental and spatial structure that man has in psychology is mainly kept."
Blood thoughts and hallucination are based on reality, to decrease the survival occurs in reality.
The scientists still stand before the trial, why our brain is just doing such shifts.
Excellent states can lead to the short-term loss of relationship with reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone's going to develop in psychology.
It seems that there is genetic dispensation for schizophrenia, but studies in doubles showed that genes are not the only specific factor.
Scientists are exciting from the fact that the affected persons have a minimum brain damage.
We believe that in the early stage of development, the neurological disorder of the brain, such as the virus disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains anxious about the violation of the neuron system that has not been demonstrated for a long time.
The roles also play the effects of the environment - stress or traumatic experiences can be the psychotic initiator if available to it.
Halucinogenic drugs can also start psychosis because they include in the transmission system.
When our brain gets closed
It is greedy that psychotronics suffer with their hallucinations, and to release them, dear medicines, others give money for drugs to get them, says the psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lübecka.
If we have overlooks as pleasant or inappropriate, there is often only a question.
Kasten has already collected ten years of reports about hallucinations and overwhelming, in the remote year, interpreted its outcomes in the book "The Irreale World in Our Head" (The Inreal World in our head).
Although the hallucination belongs to typical psychosis, many other diseases are also surprisingly surprised.
In the case of psychological disorders such as ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≥ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤
Surprisingly, he hallucines for real submines and the brain of a healthy person.
Halucinations, according to Kastena, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally affected.
They appear when parts of the brain in which sensational consideration is processed are too active or less pressured; if our brain is closed, or when the stimulation is missing.
Drogs can start this status as well as brain damage or psychiatric.
But also take stimulation, stress, concerns with love or other exceptional states.
In the newer studies, a third of the questions was that at least one time in their lives had a hallucination.
In 2005, Sarah K. 16 is in the small town of Meklenbury-East-Sealand and goes to a nearby gymnasium.
Actually, a totally normal girl.
If they weren't the forms and voices.
The stops may be that it's a big and dark hair.
When she answers, she's talking about her with a surprise, no one sees and doesn't hear this guy.
These lazy girls are thinking of a picked snow, but Sarah K. hate, she knows.
He's up, he's hearing, and he's seeing that boy, totally the same as he's hearing and seeing a girl sitting next to him in the lavage.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a good feeling. He's got that boyfriend.
I'm crazy? I'm sometimes asking.
But he knows that this guy and others are not real and they're going to disappear again.
In the night, the revelations are more deeper.
Often, they're overlooked.
When he sits in the class, he can't follow a lesson more times, because the teacher in his eyes and ears just represents a new partner, but he explains all the finally listening and visiblely on the mathematical equation table.
In the night, the revelations are more spectacular.
When he waits in his dark room for a sleep that comes too late and too late, he can often discern whether it's up or if he's sleeping, whether images he sees, grimas, or girls with bleeding wounds on his hands and feet appear in front of its opened or closed eyes.
Let me go in the room, she's crying for those positions.
She doesn't tell parents and friends about it, they would think she was crazy.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Vloni made maturity and lived with her friend.
A year ago the hallucination arose.
Since the time that Casten's psychologist contacted on the Internet, he knows exactly that she wasn't crazy.
Overlooks are also arts of disfellowship
Someone is socially isolated or is distorted by stimulation, he will have a great probability of hallucination, says Kasten.
I think the brain doesn't have enough employment, and he cares about his entertainment.
Sarah K., the only one, had as a little girl fear of the rest of the children, often played alone.
Her hallucination started when she learned at 13 years that the man who told her father since he thought it was not her own father.
Because in visual and acustic hallucinations are active the same brain, which also process real collections and sounds, it is to be achieved, such as Sarah K. hard, distinguishing the blood and reality from itself. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is playing in the brain, also the reality is shown there.
Halucinations are also images that allow the brain to appear, so they act so real."
The night dreams also evaluate Kasten as the form of hallucination.
Halucination of healthy people is not primarily different from hallucination in acute psychosis.
In contrast to the skizofrenics, psychical health of people can identify their blades as unreasonable.
That is why the case advises his patients to evaluate the hallucination as an extraordinary capacity.
Food condition between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, the imaginary experience is patologyized in our world, Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chef of Psychiatric and psychotherapeutic clinics of Florence-Nightingale hospitals in Düsseldorfu.
Psychology is a hard, suffering disease, but it also brings positive, creativeness - the overwhelming is also the art of disfellowship.
Schmidt-Degenhard examined the so-called oneuroid form of residence, a special form of dream changed.
Oneuroid states are highly complex, detailed fiktiv dreams that the concerned considers to be elected and cannot even distinguish them from cautious state.
Oneuroid status appears in extremely caused trauma or disease, such as patients with polyradical occupation, who live in a full-domain of motor protection.
When a man is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps a permanent, complete incapacity of movement, he replaces life threatening reality with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
It's a second of the condition between dream and hallucination.
Because in reality, it is not possible to be able to have an act of action, to change the world, but reality is present to the imagination.
Intensity; form of support for senses and transfer of senses into such insatisfactory, which allows people to have their own ability to form, to go through a moment to lose the domain.
Everything is real, even after it is in the vessels
Also, the historian of the art Peter Cornelius日usen describes his uneuroid lives in his book "Herzwechsel" (Switch heart) as a saved action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when the cardiovascular cardiovascular cardiovascular operation was released by his domain on a few-day road, while his body was inevitably lying on an intensity unit.
See the world that created, visited the foreigner's time and places: It becomes an old man stuck on bed, in the treasury sanatorium, robots watch his health.
He lives in an early middle age between a road that produces a weak substance from blood.
On the engine, the Greek brings it into his own authority, on the nervous bed surfs on the piece in Alâch and hits the Korean mafia.
It's totally crazy into the imaginary, everything's real, even after it's in the wrestling.
These internal roads are mainly different to any sleep.
The dream is a different state, he describes his success.
In contrast to dreams, the intervals of these mental roads are evident in years and in inappropriate details.
Even clearer and more intensive than the experience.
The intensity of this survival breaks the horizons of our other real experiences, says the psychiater Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, one-euro states, psychosis, hallucination and drugs are shown as well as in the close state of our internal images of the outermost.
Any change in the state of Domain, the psychologist Kasten, can lead to deformation of what we call reality.
The reality that can also be rejoicing.
Snow can come
Burda
On May 27 to take children's chargement
The new leadership Kallen is a transitional solution: Hubert Burd wants to deliver his business into the hands of both children, said SPIEGEL.
Holding has to be a 100 percent family in the future.
Hamburg - Company Hubert Burd sees his business in his children's hands.
Both kids will inherit in 27 years and have a strong income to the business, says the 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
We've made details carefully.
The question is, if they are also active in the company, to be addressed until then.
And the question if he has the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put 7500 employees in heads of their children if they are not sufficiently able.
That would kill like kids, so business.
Burda announced on Thursday that since January, he was downloaded from the presidency of the representative and named his representative Paul-Bernhard Kallena.
52-year Kallen is a representative member of Burdy since 1999.
First he had anxiety.
In the case of Popostna, the company's ownership was responsibility and after Jürgen Todenhaver's release, also direct marketing, citizens, Tisk and Finance.
First of all, none of the members of the family is in charge.
The boy of Burd is 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallena's name also serves to it, and he told Burd.
Holding should also belong to a 100 percent family in the future, says Burd.
In view of the cases of Schickedanz and Shaeffler, Burd said that neither family businesses had any surety before the business: "It was touched by fires that were allowed to defeat the desires of speculators and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had a "sound of the world power," he says Burd.
I don't want to be a political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play a world ligue with "Time", these trades are too big.

Miscellaneous
Birthday is near, and it is the time when it is appropriate to find out what the celebrities wear, and to adjust to it and its celebration shadow.
It is very important to highlight the law, which is needed to have on the domicile.
We'll note a few of them.
The song Fergie chose extravagant and very complicated.
Endsa in Barcelona, with electromobile
The Energy Society ends and the Barcelone Board founded 'Live Officer'.
It is a project to develop and promote electricity in the capital city of Catalan.
The LIVE Office (Electromobile Logistics) will set and will conduct the road plan for the introduction of electric cars in the city and ensuring the mobility agreements, will create, coordinate and propose contributions, etc.
It will also develop projectMOVELE, promote electromobile, collecte views and results of activities in the involved sectors.
In general, it is to support this transport channel of the future.
3 'Electrical Cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only town that is involved in the project of electromobilization in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla are also connected to the project.
It is about three cities who have chosen the Government in the MOVELE Plan to support the exploitation of electric cars.
The Energy Society endsa has already signed the Catholic Government.
The aim is to support research and development in the Catholic autonomous activities.
This also includes energy-related activities and mainly energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative with the ends' initiative regarding electrical mobilisation.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively implements a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VerDE.
It's the time'time for the car industry.
The president of the Government José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero foretold that the Spanish car industry, the main export sector of the State, waits for the "time periods".
In the economic report of the Government's President for 2009, Zapatero broadcasts the measures taken during the year to support the car sector.
"without the Competition Plan for the Car industry, we would be waiting for the status of leave, closing some of our main productive undertakings," said the President of the Government.
"By this plan and the desire of individual labels to continue to act in Spain in this high competitive sector, a certain period of calm is added to the future, which is our main export sector."
In this regard, he stressed that the competition plan, which is part of the Integral Car Sektor Plan (PIA), appointed 800 million for 19 producers projects and 137 supported fires which mobilised investments exceeding 3 billion Eur.
The President of the Government explained that this investment was intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and for the remaining processes.
He also highlighted government measures for the application of support and changed the 2000E plan, which is applied in cooperation with autonomous and car labels.
According to the statement of the president, this plan was enabled to reduce 6% of the medium cold in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, and strengthened the "valuable growth" of the records, particularly by "40 per cent in November".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first International Room of Classical Vehicles will be opened, which is a space for meeting professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will run on 5-7 February 2010 in the Madrid Casa de Campo.

Mazda3 i-Stop: preservation of sports
Although it is appropriate to show that the career to the surroundings has no negative effect on sport.
And therefore Mazda3 has a building system of delay and starting engine - also baptized as-Stop, which is the equipment that are currently available only with the benzin engine 2.0 150 horse.
This second generationMazda3 is marked by good characteristics that it has reached as a whole.
Surface adjustment, vehicle execution, residence, behaviour, mechanism, system i-Stop...
All these aspects are exciting in Mazda3.
The front seats of the driver's places have exciting ergonomies and are very fixed.
The callant is too extraordinary.
With the composition of tools and consoles, we will conclude that Mazda continues in Japan's trend in developing a future stick design with many buttons and eggs and a distinct red and blue color.
This is partly a part of our presentation of Honda Civic.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrast to the frequency of German products and particularly more with Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to hurt.
As usually, this Japanese compact product represents more than a sufficient space for four adults who want a very comfortable drive.
Moreover, it is necessary to mention a large legacy space and regular face.
The automatic stop and starting engine system is still available only with a benzin engine for two litres and 150 horse forces for a six-adequate hand-transfer.
This engine is a real layer. It's very nice, indicating a decreased level of sound, its performance and the lower degree.
Although the most requested Mazda3 is in the version of diel, everyone who doesn't find so many kilometers per year should not pull this i-Stop with a benzine engine, because it is indicated to a more comfortable commodity in the road and the decrease.
As regards equipment, the version selected to test is called Sportive and includes more series of elements.
Serial equipment should be mentioned in the main system of monitoring of leaders (RVM), which prevents the appearance of a dead angle, knowledge and stability, control, internal sensor sensitive to light, palub computer with a large screen, parking knife, single climatisation, sensor of rain and light, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and road of 17-pillars.
And if the equipment wasn't enough, this version was equipped with Pack Premium, for appendix 1.500 euro: adaptable lights of doublexenon and sound BOSE with CD holder, other than parts.
Closure
About 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is especially the quality of the materials used, its operation and its high level of equipment.
Moreover, people who do not find more than a miles per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with a benzin engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only income of this model is its highest price that makes 21.770 euros in the implementation of Luxury and 23.270 euros in the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a large dose of satisfaction for each day.
Luxury 'Premier'
L. A. has a red cow, a hand like the hands of Penélope, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars were more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of 'Nine'. (Foto: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usually, chose the dark 'lady'.
FonPeek Address
Peek is extremely limited, serves only to browse mail, without the possibility of viewing a certain type of attachment or to surf on the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of glory in the United States when the magazine Time assessed her as one of the products of the year.
It's more difficult to see her outside, but this idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
For a distance from smartphones, Peek is highly low price and monthly payments, less than half amount, for example for iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new equipment: one is exclusively designed for Twitter, the other on the basis of a free data service, but it is necessary to pay for Peek a six-six-six-six-six-sized amount.
FonPeek, represented yesterday in Le Web action, is a European version of finding and the third of its change.
It's limited as his American protester, but it brings surprise.
The monthly price for maintenance makes approximately 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People who travel with a smartphone already mean to come about the data service after crossing the border or not long-term search for a WiFi café (or connecting to Fon) so that they can see the mail.
The idea with rooming at a fixed price is incrediblely attractive and should be established for a long time.
Yes, some operators have a special way and a plan, but according to my experience, a person would need a doctor from the physics to understand them, and a very good brilliant to read the miniature letter.
The European Commission continues to require decreasing roaming tariffs so that they are accessible for all Europe, which still does not have a bleeding.
There's a damage of use of data services outside the home country.
The fact that such a device such as FonPeek (is interesting that it still has the name of Fon if it does not have WiFi) will reach this type of tariff means that operators start thinking differently and consider different offers that would compensate their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offers book downloads and other searches on the Internet.
No s'y, no complication.
This equipment is connected and applied when purchasing, never after months.
And that's exactly what I'm expecting to happen once in the case ofFonPeek, it's about the possibility of buying with a permanent access such as Peek has already been implemented in the United States.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the mail on my phone, thank you.
I'm expecting it, because I think it's the best guy for the need.
It would be interesting if the same system was used on the computer.
The color that Michelle loves
Yellow is certainly a favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama's arrival to the president of the United States, she chose clothes and cabs in this color, she also chose the same color when she delivered it at the second most important moment of his life: the transfer of Nobel's peace price in Osla.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it was a similar color - yellowed with triple effects - in both cases it was a classic completion - clothes, bags and cabs of the same substance - a large height or lime.
In the first view, the first lady of the United States decided to walk in the tracks of the Astria Princess and wear similar clothes.
The file from which the clothing is prepared makes both models significantly different.
At the opportunity of the arrival to Michelle, she used a big resort, in Osla, with a calamity.
Changes and supplements: green bottles with a middle-height underfall, a currently similar model, but in gold colour.
It also wears different: this cordol, before the hair is released.
75% of the working mothers have a job in relation to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in younger women who are going to arrange a child.
This is the outcome of the study "Future and work" of the Spanish women's career, which CSIC conducted in cooperation with the woman's Institute.
9.737 women attended from 15 to 75 years of age and results are unique: 75% of the working mothers have an opportunity on the labour market from mothers.
It emphasizes that at the beginning of the partnership, there are many divisions in view of a number of children according to whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the house, work on partial account or do not have stable jobs, start living with their partner earlier, earlier born the first child and generally have more children.
On the other hand, women with stability employment, especially in the public sector, partnership and maternity, and have less offspring.
"The women from 35 to 49 years have the first child's stability in the average of 3.7 years from the beginning of a partnership. This number makes 4,1 in the case of women, where their stability employment has developed the largest part of their lives and thus have to replace the partnership and children's arrival.
The type of call has the same powerful influence on motherhood, even if it is less affected by the start of the relationship with a partner," explains Margarita Delgado, which is in the CSIC research.
Another factor that affects women during the closure of the spouse is a degree of education.
Research shows that the higher level of education is even higher when women come and have their first child.
The differences are also between women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of 35 to 49 years of primary and higher education, women born their first child in 25,1 p. 32,
"There is another division between women depending on their education.
Women with primary education are given and born the first child before they find stable employment, while women with a middle or higher education are acting on the opposite way to get stability employment, before the wedding and the birth of the first child," Delgado states.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris just added a new name to its pressing list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
Since the next year, the German herd has become the face of different products of this tag under the universal password 'Because I'm worth it'.
The representative 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant international levels, is added to another glorious personalityL'Oreal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spain Penélope.
Before it, they entered the Evangeline Lilly's heretic club and Freeda Pinto ('Millionary of Chatrche').
The Panish part of this cosmetics mark is also represented by significant characteristics:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelinin partner in 'The Lost').
British Mode Prices
British owners have a lot of things to talk about mode.
Their most important representatives - instruments and models, former and now - have met on the annual transmission of prices in London, Royal Court os Justice.
Nobody missed the meeting.
Ancient Jerry Hall model and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen by the best model of the year.
Poker Manuela Vicenta
Manuel Vicent provides in 'Esova Poker' (Alfaguara, illustration of Fernando Vicente) thirty recorders of the recorders with whom he met in his literary life (and in some cases and in the current life).
It does not do so in fearful and predictable genres (biographic similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to creature.
The road brings a surprise, and Vicent doesn't care about roads or inspiration.
This book is a wonderful reading benefit, even when reading again.
Here's some watch.
About Albert Camus: "I found on the pages of this book that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but the spirit of impulse, even physical, the same as what I feel, but it can't be known: the benefit of the anti-duty, the moral without the fault and the innocentness without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, a Alegoric Christian, wrote for his own nature and never the intellectual, something between the insight and the ignorance, with a blinding poetical humor, without meaning, as if it was the shock of a knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been charged with this woman for all thirteen years, citizenship, pleasure and recreation, which is the privilege of reaching heaven through the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssea issued in Paris in 1922, Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eighty tops of the universal literature, which is needed to overcome from the north side, from which the best time will be seen."
About William Faulkner, "He was a strange man.
He said about himself that he was the inheritance of a shipmater from the ship, otherwise he was the son of a black crocodile.
In both cases, it was a great dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer captured the pool of this man from Mnich to bring his call to the night of the 20th century in his literary image, fleeing from himself and calling to the future, and moving to the wheels."
About Dorothy Parker, "Every of them fell and prayed, "God, my dear, let me stop writing as a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "In his grave, Spenser's verses were cut off: 'The dream will come,/ after the storm a calm present,/ after the war of rest,/ after the full-valuable life of death."
About Virginia Wolf: "He also took his depression into his commitments.
The husband completely agreed to tell him that Eduard VII followed her among the asalks or that the birds sang Greek.
No man was so patient and loved in a neurotic, whose literary talent goes in hand with foolishness."
About Pio Barrow: "What else did Martha Santos do than to fix Joyce on Baroy?
What else happened to Benet than to let Baroy fix Faulkner's weapons?
What was the matter with the Destination, except to be glorified in the work of the man's glory?"
Agression of the white
Last week my seventy-year mother passed our fourth, during the period of Fuenlabrada, and a group of youths in 15 to 18 years passed by the rod and our dog, the cross saved from the weight weight of a maximum of six kilograms, without one word, they bought it twice and severely hurt.
Our disappointment is more important that we will not see anything fun in such an aggression against a small and unprofit animal that was also on the leadership.
And that choke of old lady after this incident, when she shot with these individuals, she began to be afraid of her own security, because such a devil who attacks the animal is able to do the same thing to the woman, the child, the old man or anyone who is weaker than he himself.
It happened at five hours afternoon, on Wednesday, in a calm quarter.
Peisek was crying all day.
Of course, we made a complaint on the nearest Commissionership, but we doubt that it was something, and we didn't call for a loving question, we notice that these white murders were Spanish nationals.
The injury has made us, and they have announced this.
We don't understand what's happening with today's youth when they enjoy suffering from the undefensive animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't understand where the right growth has been shared, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for helm use
In collaboration with the Spanish Transport Safety Support (Fesvial), a campaign started to support the use of helm, mainly in younger engines, as both of these entities today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of the use of helma, because it is the only thing that can be avoided by the injury of the head and death in the case of a accident in the motorcycle drive.
The company Michelin states that this campaign is part of their commitments to transport security, which "signifies more than to explore and produce more safer products" and confirmed that it is trying to comply with this area and otherwise in the form of instruction and information campaign.
This new campaign for supporting the use of the helma at the motorcycle, under the password 'To be or not to be', is the first stage when up to over 500 fairs of motorcycles will be located in developments to get to the most largest public.
Finally, Michelin warned that the transport security "is a continuous problem" of this company, which is a manufacturer of pneumatics for two-fold vehicles, and its main goal is a continuous increase in the safety of products.
The sale of light use vehicles is increased
After two years, the market of easily useful vehicles begins to be remembered.
All 9.425 vehicles established in November in Spain represented an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and more than 22 months of sustainable incidence, according to the numeric data of the Anfac producers' pattern organisation and sellers of Ganvam.
However, a good data is better to give to the Quarantine, since November 2008 is a significant bad period of comparison and represented 60% of decreasing compared to the previous year.
The investigation is that, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of vehicles notified in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous year.
From January, 95.853 vehicles were sold, including all possible vehicles falling into the category of light use vehicles: personal car derivates, pick ups, supplies, lower cost cars and light trucks/cars.
And not even clouds that most damage the request, even though they bought private persons, the majority of purchases performed smaller and medium-sized companies, and in the meantime, 100% cases are financing for third-party.
In order to restrict the closure of bank credit resources, additional factors such as the stop of activities or the continuation of bad economic resources should be added.
In the Danemark, as part of personal vehicles, the 2000E purchasing support has not been too helped.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention rates on the animal and medium-small plants that are intended to buy a light-used car up to 3.5 tonnes with CO2 level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the amount of operation was confirmed.
Just yesterday, they reminded that it was necessary to take special attention to the management of these vehicles and also the industrial vehicles (camons and buses).
The sales association assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to loni and, according to the calculation of sales in private vehicles and 4x4 will be decreased by 19%.
The help system in the handshot is already mandatory.
Like in the ABS anti-locking system, it will also be with the management of the ESP stability, the helping systems of handshore, all of this will become a obligation to equip European vehicles.
It is already a part of the mandatory equipment of all newly detected personal cars and easily use vehicles, while the rest is set out for the elimination of the failure, which is February 2011.
The EU's measures are aimed at enhancing the protection of travellers, while it works so that it can help to avoid many of them.
The help system of hand-bearing increases the pressure on the bottle in the emergency case, which will prove when the driver is driving.
But he's not able to keep this pressure until the end.
According to the study carried out by the manufacturer of car parts of Bosch, a third of the drivers who had an accident did not lay the wind before the spring, and half of them did not use the power of the spring.
Up to 1.100 accidents
Instead, this aid requires a maximum of the brake system, decreases the strict distance of the vehicle.
According to the studies carried out in the EU solely if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, it could be avoided to 1 100 death accidents related annually to travellers.
The decrease of this number will be even more significant for calculations would prevent one of the four accidents with the impact of persons- after the introduction of such intelligent systems of handcare.
In this case, the vehicle shall be equipped by a system that (radiar or camera) takes obstacles and reports it to the drivers, other than a easily driving.
The driver's response, he'll help him to increase the pressure on the pedal if needed.
The driver does not respond, even in cases where the swimming cannot be prevented, the equipment will affect more inevitably on the floor and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors replaces the plan for Opel to ice
Nick Reilly, the new president of the company General Motors (GM) Europe, of Opel's employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that the production of the new Meriva will be started in the first week of April - probably on 8 April - as Javier Ortega informed, the American manufacturer warns that to fulfil the renewal plan for Opel will need more time.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to make each point of plan first agree with the side concerned.
The final document, which will be submitted first to the employees and then to the governments of individual countries in which the manufacturing facilities are located, will be issued at the late beginning of 2010.
In contrast, GM ensures that Saab’s sale decision should be taken in these days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure of the American producer to take certain decisions first.
GM enables contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to get Volvo, but considers the possibility of the Netherlands Sport Manufacturer of Skyper, who acts under the protection of the Russian Group of Converg.
In the case that it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some assets of Saab from the Chinese company Baic.
It continues to be applied to decide to close at the end of the year of Saab, unless it can't sell.
Travel with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this excellent model, Boxster S engineers from Porsche used as a foundation, and they were able to reduce the weight of 80 kg, thus weight indicates only 75 kg.
Based on the first row, the automatic download box was paid with hand control, with which the weight was decreased by 21 kg; further used by the carriage doors such as GT3, which means other 15 kg less; the elimination of the aircraft, 13; the reduction of the fuel content from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to the decrease of the weight of 7 kg; after the installation of other sports seeds of 12 kg, thanks to the 19-palm rounds of five kilo.
And finally, removal of the CDR-30 audio means more six pounds less and replaced by textile captures means another kilogram.
It also offers a double PDK transmission, a vehicle with a manually classified six-degree box, mainly on the roads of the second class in California, in the mountain ranges with a lot of covered sticks.
His behaviour can only be observed as inappropriate.
Decrease weight does not mean that the asfalt vehicle is not printed.
Moreover, we have not already found such a small and easy model that would, at the same time, translate such security when moving in the box, even in the high levels.
It's a small athlete able to hang the cows at a short drive after the time we need until we order him sprint, screening, and re-using the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to the management that is so communicative as precise, whatever we're identifiing the hands on the volant, it's what the car's doing.
And he's going to do it with the chirurgical accuracy.
Engine sound by voluntary
Sound V6 boxer, with 320 horses (on 10 more than Boxster S) is very shameful and it is possible to strengthen it by the "sport" and the system's ability to modify the engine sound that was already used in Panamary.
Capacity of acceleration is brutal, whether or not, when sowing or recovery.
The locks are strong, but not strong or inappropriate.
Asfalt roads we're walking with Boxster Spyder was quite devastated, but the car got a good demand.
Electronic support was very unnecessary during the driving, and in some cases, we have been able to celebrate on the morning and even on the advanced afternoon.
Definitely this ultra-easy car is one of the most funny in the market because it is something more than just changing Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 for the price of EUR70.831.
'Small Girl'
Friend Karla Lagerfelda, the Coco Cocoon row icon and the possibility of 'starlette' on the views of 'firms', the singer leads his face of evil girls as great as your Chanel cabs.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl' is 'Bag Girl'.
Basconium has made a victory in Israel
The work was acquired by a brilliant victory in 82-91 at its hosting at the complicated Maccabi Electra cross, despite reading absentions in Duska Ivanoa's company, and thus reached the head of his group after the great exhibition of Mirzy Teleto, who with eight three points was the best announcement of the company (29 evaluation).
Vitorie has been able to replace significant non-presentanceHerrmanna, Olesona, Huertase or Micoa with a large dose of saturation and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to gain victory.
Furthermore, the large accuracy of the circuit with 16 three points has contributed much to the final triumph.
The spider started with his head for the blue, who set up on the label from the beginning.
The first four bags for Vitoria were from a distance, which already indicated that they attacked the Israelite community very strongly.
English and Teletovic belonged to the main shooter 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Albanian company decided for the internal game Baraca and the work of Eliyahu, who was adopted by singing and driving when returning to his ping operation to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to be the best in his company with 13 points, although no six' in the Splittera evaluation already indicated that it was the best night for Brazil.
But despite that the bathroom was steadfast until the breakdown, it was not even decided in the least and the Arabs wanted to remember Vitoria that everyone won't at their shoes, and 'Eliase' could win.
Eidson and Pnini were definitely contributing to the "julty" return to the outcome (50-49).
More Inadequate
The members of Ivanovic, injury, but not dead, needed a few precise hers to get a breath, and thereafter the Mirza Teletovic culomet appeared, which three-three teams after himself and with English and Ribase returned the score to a calm amount (54-67), which reached local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The alabs sent their skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they do not allow anyone to prepare them for the first 30 minutes' outcome.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their husbandhood, did not depart and tried to keep the company in life from three points (70-77).
Despite that, and with Splitter expelled for the faul seIvanovic, they did not defeat and protect them well, and even though the Israelites approached a final minute (80-85), the bathroom had already wined aTel A.
Worries disable the Union to fight
The Union was expressly lost in Greece with Olympiacos and left him leading the group B in Eurolise in a stock, which was significant by three attacks from Unicaia, but mainly the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.

Brazil determined the date of Zelay's department
The Brazilian Government has established the time of Manuel Zelayi's maintenance at its Majesty in Tegucigalp.
The meeting president must leave the diplomatic mission at the latest on 27 January 2010, when his mandate is officially finished.
Francisco Catunda, the chargé d’affaires of Brazilian village in the main town of Hundory, confirmed for the TV Globo that "Mel" knows that it must go from the ambassador where it is hidden from September 21.
"It's the fact that on 27 January after the end of his mandate, he must go and look for another attack."

Thank you
After days of wine and rain from the past yarn, when the inflation of actives represented overwhelming markets, it has revealed an uncertainty on the markets, which should not be surprised because it is already a natural situation in the ≥ where the operators make decisions on the future, which are inconscient about themselves.
The medicinal product used by central banks to stabilise the market was the debt of direct purchase of assets and the direct release of liquidity in the nearly zero rate so that financial institutions could purchase assets to discharge.
The Central Banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have already been completed and without doubt their uncoherent liquidity policy, begin to spend a little sand into the cocktail, as the Spanish Central Bank has been acting with its employment in the latest year.
The investors therefore doubt the ability of the world's economy to maintain economic renewal without such a heterodox measures, and the return of risk reduction.
The movement of the bullocks and the differences in the length of the length re-country have obtained points, although they are still very remote irregular levels achieved at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risks, which re-interfered with public debt.
The quality of the United States, Japan and Germany have become a refugee for the selected investment, which has extended the difference in the euro countries against Germany.
Spain was not so stabil, but at that time the Standard & Poor's came and threatened the new review of the decreasing of the Spanish Kingdom.
On the other hand, a certain failure is not useful for delaying residents of moral risks, who have tried to re-employ the conscience of the people responsible for the world economic policy because of deteriorating deficiencies in limiting the credit to employment, where a new day of thanks should be reported.
However, Dubai represents a tribe fight between the emirs for the renewal of power in the emirates, and regarding Greece, we have already seen this before.
The government covering deficit, choices and new governments.
He sold this in Italy after Berlusconim and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barros.
It does not mean that Ecofin will save Hungary from the failure of payments at the beginning of the year and enable the Member State to not comply with its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin will offer the Greek Government to transparency and commit its own citizens to the common responsibility in the need of exceptional measures to reduce its public funds' stability.
If, as we expect, we are before the normalization of the premium of transitional risk, some of the positions at supported positions would be expected.
In the case of Spain, while our differences in the public debt will increase as the debts of European companies, we do not need to be concerned.
Europe's differences are decreasing, and ours will continue to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is only an anecdote. When our primary indicators need a lot of studies to take their renewal scenario and revise their approach scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not mean that for the Spanish economy will be fulfilled.
Again, it seems to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although in the meantime "attentionally, friends of drivers".
Relative sectors
President Iberdrol Ignacio Sanchez Galán was the first intervention before the subcommittee, where the Energy Strategy of Spain has been negotiated in these days in the next two decades.
After his intervention followed by President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasecy, Galan presented a number of comments on the subcommittee behind the closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol Spain, 50,000 million euros are invested until 2020 and more 60,000 million from this date to 2030, if nuclear electricity are currently in operation.
If so, the necessary investment will be 60,000 million and up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investment must be intended not to increase production capacity, but distributing networks and international connections
The question has changed since 2020 and will need to increase the performance.
His offer is focused on gases and corners with carbon oxide capture mechanisms and mainly on renewable energy.
In this case, it seems that new 18,000 MW needs, but with other "supported energy".
Galan, who believes that a woman's law on a sustainable economy, which has just approved the government, corresponds to the line that the undertaking requested, did not want to leave a living as a king decree to support the detention of a national carbon, which resists the political fight against climate changes.
According to his opinion, it is "fairly" in this sense, despite the "accurate" measures, as President Iberdrol called.
Whatever it is, Galan believes that the investment decisions, even though it is, must be taken now because their observation continues and is necessary to be a stability tax collection for their start.
Ferrovial wins 'action' Aer Lingus on ten aircraft
The daughter of Ferrowial for airport services, the Swiss company Swissport, will play the role of the preferential partner of the Irish Aer Lingus for the cost services for ten European airports, where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels belongs to the most important of them.
The agreement from which the economic terms have not yet occurred has been valid to five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Kastilie-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol on cooperation in the creation of the Centre for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The Association assumes investment for 20 million until 2012, from which 50% appear to Ferrowial.
One of the central tasks will be the research of energy efficiency in forests and airports.
Acciona strives to his first distance in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fights for its first concess on the remote part of Australia, which is a market where it already works as a energy and water funding company.
The station of the tunnel is estimated to 1.700 million Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 million euros).
Her supports are the French Bouygues company and the German Hochtief.
The tunnel of 5 km long in the Australian town of Brisbane, on the east coast, became the closest opportunity to sit in this country as a building and concession distant company.
The officer wants to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After choosing public-private cooperation (PPP according to English initiative) for further development of the project in the trade plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of building and operation of the bullet.
The proposals are expected to be submitted in May, and the estimated investment will reach 1.700 million Australian dollars (EUR ≥047 million) and at the last stage of the competition of three concerts with a significant presentation in European buildings.
A group named Transcity is Vice Accion, the only Spanish company in competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
It is one of the largest Australian building companies, and the second with the seat in Italy is one of the largest European specialists for underground buildings.
In contrast with the Akion Group, the Northern Concern is in the game with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French Building Group Bouygues.
The third and last concert that has passed the network has the name LBRJV and shared in it the australian Leighton (dotter of the German building company Hochtief, here confidenced’S), also the local Baulderstone (the property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a significant company specialized for the civil building of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatization, but the difficulty of entering is with him in other ways than the acquisition of local building companies.
It is still an example for Spanish giants in the sector other than the Asian references.
It has obtained a position on the market through its 30% share in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Millions of assets
The acion will focus on the geographical and the greatest expertise for the sector in which it already has a significant presentation through its energy supplier's activities and in the salary trade.
In addition to other assets, the largest park in Waubra (192 MW) is in Victoria and leads a group of enterprises that set up and manage solving equipment in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and to use common energy to access building and infrastructure operation.
The subterraneous road understood by the town of Brisbane, the Office for Infrastructures, named Northern Link (Northern Link), is to join the west distance from Toowongu with the circuit road to Kelvin Grove (see map) at 5 km of the tunnel. It is the greatest action for reducing the transport burden of Brisbane.
The calendar established by local administration plans tasks for the year 2010 and the start of work for the next year.
Although this payable movement would be opened in the past months 2014, the full end of work is planned until 2016.
Tunel started designing in 2005.
It will include two runs in each direction, the system of the electronic mixed and complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane has already offered this invitation Hochtief
It still brings a significant profit of Hochtive, since she announced yesterday with a government estimated to 154 million.
Participation of its local branches, Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with cabel from optical flames.
This will enable access to the Internet to 400,000 people and provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the building project of King George at 27 places in the Australian town of Brisbane. The building work had to start and Hochtief closed the sale for 129 million.
In Britain, particularly in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke in building and operating two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC was assigned tone in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC throughout its Alpine branches obtained an allocation of a tunnel building at 2.5 miles for a distance in Slovenia at a value of 64.5 million euros.
The company received a few days after the work on the extension of the tunnel in Bosruck (Russia) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens her experience in the building of tunnels.
The start of work is planned at the beginning of 2010 and the period of implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got advertising in Renfe

63 million for France Télécom for competition
The Competition Regulatory Authority in France has replaced 63 million euros LFrance Télécom for anti-concurrence behavior in the Caribbean parts of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of firm and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and programmes on the border of the regulation.
This sanction has been purchased by the former French monopol and the State company has purchased more than 560 million euros from 1994 for interrupting their competitors.
There was a de facto increased that France Télécom was viewed as a similar crime as in the past, and thus occurred in recitive.
Commerce with emblems
On the other hand, the French company's mobile side is still a star between other operators and has opened the internet trade to increase income that can be found from voting transfers.
From the beginning, the trade with Orange will be active in France and the Great Britain.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for access to other countries as Spain.
Game in Champions has brought from beginning 476,4 million Madrid and Barce
The Liga of Masters became a source of income for these clubs since its exhibition in 1992.
In the meantime that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made 476,4 million since that time, which makes the third and fifth most productive club in competition.
The list looks at Manchester United.
The list looks at Manchester United.
It is also one of the main resources for large clubs to win the EUFA Master Liga.
Until that competition divided 5.362,5 million euros between 105 partners (of 12 Spanish) which participated in this action from the turnover in 1992/1993, according to EUFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have gone out of this division very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money that he gained, and the only together with Milan, who wined three times the main price.
The current catalan champion and the last victory of Europe's increasing poverty in 1992 is classified on fifth.
The list leads Manchester United and Mnichov Bayern, two companys who were more money in the past Lisa of Masters.
And yet she lost both of her with Barce.
On the other hand, Spain is up to the third country, which has gained most money through Champions, although most titles were obtained from all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Layout
This famous paradox is explained by a complex procedure in the distribution of the money used by the EUFA.
In this year, the authority of the president of Michel Platini is planning to make up 090 million for Champions League.
From these money, the EUFA has 413.1 million for solid payments: each of the 20 clubs participated in a pre-classification rail (although otherwise, Atlético Madrid) has received 2.5 million.
Furthermore, those who have reached have received 3.8 million only for their presence, other than 550,000 euros for each stock.

Each of the last four will get four million.
Shampion wins 9 million, while the second finalist 5.2 million.
The Club will produce at least 7.1 million and maximum 31.2 million on solid payments.
On the other hand, Barça received 2.5 million for victory in the European superpower in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments for which 337.8 million are assigned.
These money shall be divided according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main places and has four places assigned.
Shampion will get 40% allocated money, the second 30%, the third20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of stocks played in this year.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group published yesterday the details of the purchase offer of action, with which it wants to get a top place between 25% and 29.9% of Sos.
This percentage does not bind to make public offers for all valuable papers (options).

The offer is subject to the nomination of eight of the 15 members of the Council.
The Jeresh group provides 15 days to inform the shareholders of their interest in sale.
The CNMV declared that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that he had been connected to the regulatory authority.
The purchase will be made, the price would reach 611.7 million while the capitalisation of Sos is 254.27 million.
Soss continues to change the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to stay on the border of possible offers for purchasing and compensation of the courts of his former leaders, the brothers of Jesus and Jaime Salazars, the election of Mary Luisy Jordan was announced as a leader of the internal audit.
This Decision makes the first woman which has been covered by a high-scale in the food business.
It is a new creation of a place that will be subject to the president of the group.
And it is not taken out of the polemics because the company is still deceived in the legal battle of a data movement of more than 230 million of the Soss brothers of Salazar.
De facto can't rectify the possibility that Sos will discover new fund movements in the next months

New car evaluation tools
In these days, the storms and accidents will produce not only autoservices.
Each day, thousands of cars suffered by a fatal event are transferred to the service where the employer must consider the damage and costs of reality.
No matching event is the same and the calculation of the costs for shares and the time of energy can be long and difficult work.
Calculate manually costs for the costs of the charge from 200,000 to 30,000 euros in total shares and the work of forces can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, this would be a question of minutes
That is why 100% of the scientists are using this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for the assessment of the tasks and maintenance shall collect information provided by manufacturers to prepare and offer a useful tool to their customers.
In Spain Audatex, from the American Solera group, it is a leading company; 80% of the evaluation are carried out with its products.
Other companies competiting in the fields of evaluation and processing information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velazquez, Commerce Director Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers and each of them provide information in another format.
In addition, the quantity of data for processing continues to grow, since more versions, variants and engine solutions have been indicated in the last five years than in the past 15 years.
When the new vehicle comes on the market, these enterprises will start working.
It's a very hot job because it's necessary to catalogue each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and fix its price.
Furthermore, each model is conducted by "intelligent" graphical processing, where it is possible to "build" individual parts of tourist vehicles.
This is a model with massive sale, work can be ready for a week if the process is very ≥.
This is a minority car, which may last three or four months. At present Audatex has 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models that have information belongs to Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
About the rail park they are over 99%.
For the implementation of the documentation and processing of the database, Audatex has eight averages divided worldwide (Spania, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them is specialized for specific marks.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than 100 technicians (normally mechanical experts) working with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros per year in the processing of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are included and customers are available to update every two days.
The processing of this irreparable flow of information allows enterprises to use and provide different products.
The most frequent uses are focused on properties and maintenance, but, according to individual countries, there are also tools for the management of replacement shares or for the calculation of the sales or remaining values of the car.
The only undertaking available to the cotton that informs the value of the vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex is not offering in our country, but in the United States, yes.
With the reporter of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to obtain aid to be used by professionals in the sector.
This undertaking offers ten different tools, while the star product is AudaPlus, a standard solution to the evaluation of the accurate events designated for the experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and easy and hard industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs for shares, it also includes time for the manufacturer's or the lack.
This tool shall be applied according to the use of each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it a little, maximum ten times a month.
Then every insurance that carries thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN enables the full identification of the vehicle and equipment coming from the mounting line only on the basis of the first number of the submotion.
AudaGlass is focused on the vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service for the professional sector on the Internet, which allows you to arrange vehicles with a totally fixed event.
His statistical service is very useful for identifying the trend, performing geodemographic analysis or detecting derogations according to tags or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many model marks have passed through the service of the havary or how many have suffered serious events during certain periods.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company that is being developed in this type of tools.
Furthermore, Gt Estimate sells, which is also designed for a scientist and also provides digital images, access to shares or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is the company of Einsa group based in 1971 as a service provider and a solution to evaluation of damage, hawair or car maintenance
Gt Guía assessment is its historical historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 employees in services, 3.100 scientists and 53 insurance.
The volume of turnover increased by 20% per year in the last three years and EUR 10,8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of the remote year, the process of internationalization of the office in Paris started.
Audatex appeared in Germany in 1966, and in 1979 she was in Spain.
According to the resources of the company, 62% of her brother appear in Europe and 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance and 33,000 services, from which 3,000 in Spain.
The world facturation of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is more than $3.3% in 2008.
In our country, the company wins 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than the lone.
In 2005, the group of Soler stood at $1,000 million and now its share is estimated as a total value of $2,400.
Since 2007, it has been catched in New York and included in a reference index Standard & Poor's.
Internet transport of havaryed vehicles
In October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, the Internet base for sale of cars and motocycles or special vehicles after the event.
The operation assumed 59.5 million euros from 85% of the company, which could increase with 15% remaining in the next year.
The purpose of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This service of evaluation and purchase and sales is exclusively handed to professionals in the sector, such as insurance, scientists,leasures, services, sales of replacement shares and professional sellers who must be registered before the start of the operation.
This platform appeared in 1996 in Germany and managed more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, from which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey appear among the main markets.
Web has currently more than 1.500 registered sellers and 4.000 experts.
It manages 3.000 daily insects and adds approximately 100 new insects every day on the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish legislation, the car number of the transport number was equipped cannot be returned to the operation, but it may be used as a source of replacement shares that were not damaged.
The vehicles with historical value may have an authorised operation, even if they were arranged, after the preliminary procedure.
Start service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller facility Audatex, Audatex ensures that it will only get the budget in four steps: the identification of the vehicle, the search of the replacement, the creation of the budget agency.
Easy to use is a primary submission for these systems, especially for the convincement of professionals in a higher or less manner that are sustainable in the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1.034 vehicles, of which 666, 109 areas, 137 motorcycles, 78 supplies and 44 trucks.
It is natural for use that computer is needed to connect to the Internet.
After the identification of the model to be performed using the sub-transport numbers, the actual graphical display of the model shall be detected and then the necessary replacement share shall be selected.
The user may include variables such as the price of the workshops, supplies or slopes, and then print and deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a tool to evaluate as AudaPlus, but more than a reference directory.
The division between the two systems is that it is oriented on service and does not include an estimate of the work of force.
The costs for the use of this long-term instrument are EUR 350 per year, which the customer may finance.
Today, Audatex is working on this view to be three-dimensional.
This is the innovation that the mechanisms welcome, for example, can choose the door and rotate them to decrease the internal side.
