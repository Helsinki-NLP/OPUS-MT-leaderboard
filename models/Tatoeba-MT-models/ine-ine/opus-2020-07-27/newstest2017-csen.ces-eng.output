The Czech roads invested in the modernization of vehicles over 31 billion.
They have climate and new toilet.
In the past six years, the State transporter invested in modernization of vehicles over 31 billion coron.
A third of the vehicles is currently equipped with climate, about half of the trains has a new system of closed WCs.
However, parts of modernization in individual years, except 2012, are gradually decreased.
Czech roads have invested in the modernization of vehicles over 31 billion crowns in the last six years.
The third of the vehicles is currently the aircraft, about half of the trains have a new system closed WC.
The money charged has been shown in the decreasing of the average age of two years in locomotive and separate units and six years in classic vagons.
The larger part of the investment has made the transporter to regional transport where approximately 60 per cent of the money provided, and 40 per cent of the company invested in renewal vehicles.
The average locomotive and currently the units are 19 years old.
Modernized older vehicles, however, are used as completely new in this indicator.
Without calculating the modernisation of vehicles, the average age of the CHD vehicles would grow in 10 years.
Something older are personal vagons, whose average rate is 23 years at the time of modernization.
The average age of these vehicles would have been 33.4 years.
Classical compositions compounded from vagons and locked locomotive, however, in the last years of Czech and the worldwide railways gradually mixed and replaced by motor or electric units.
During 2011 and 2015, the 280 to 223 cuss locomotives were likely to decrease the number of classic vagons from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of the year.
The carrier was particularly released from the old vehicles equipped with skin seats and doors without the possibility of locking the opening during the driving.
From January to July, he allowed the transporter to rotate 110 of these vehicles.
From investments planned to the vehicle park to achieve in the close future, it is possible for example to introduce a purchase of 50 vagons for ≥ 200 km per hour, which the transporter plans to set on the international line of Praha - Bratislava - Budapest, or a compound for purchase of electric units for foreign traits.
S ·a calculates with up to 30 cups of motor and 20 cups of electric units.
The Offices of the Fourth Year are about illegal advertising, they cannot be released.
We're absolutely weak, recognized.
For the fourth year of the editing online journal Currently.cz follows the story of the billboard in South Czech, which now allows motorists to visit Lipna, where there is not only tourists who are interested in tree corners but also the olympical park.
The remote administrators think that they're standing right there, but they're saying they're not able to do anything with that.
Similar advertisements are hundreds throughout the country, perhaps thousands.
According to the officers, there is a chatting law that is not possible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
It's needed to be a complex birocratic road forward.
Meanwhile, the company changes the name and the office is short on it.
Or the advertising is enough to move a couple of meters and the official process must be restarted.
The Guideline of Roads and Roads a fourth year acknowledged: The main knowledge from the Czech Bupéovic to Lipno stands on our ground at the state road of advertising billboard squarely.
Not for three months, but the officers were left to escape unleavened transmissions with an inserted plaque.
As if no one would be able to stand close to the car, in a 50-meter protective station, where nothing can happen for security.
The road managers claim that billboard can't be easy to consult with a billboard because of the law.
You need to load it and take it away.
"It can't only allow us so," says the Chairman's Guideline of the Road and Valleys of Nina Ledvin, and refers to a complex bureaucratic road, which the removal of the billboard must predict in accordance with the law.
The case of this specific billboard, whose decree has started online journal Currently.cz for detailed monitoring on the jacket, is not unique and shows a general problem that must not state and authorities effectively and solve.
Only in the southern Czech Republic, she counted tens of similar mobile advertisements against the rules close to the vehicle or nearby.
Similarly, there are other countries on that.
"We have the forces of firms to make the leaders remove," confirms the Chairman of the Czech National Agency of Jiří Class, whose colleagues have the similar stories.
According to the Class, there's an injury law that the officers associate.
Forward, the owner of the billboard must hardly cry out to make the advertising gone.
But the boss firem are often inappropriate or know the finth already currently.ch has been described in the past when the problem began to be more detailed: enough mobile stage with advertising to move a couple of meters, and the officers can have the previous challenge to remove the black inzerce to go into the waste.
It's because the office has to determine exactly where illegal billboard is standing.
"When someone moves him and does not agree once, he looks at it as a new equipment, and we have the owner to blame again," explains Jiří Class.
The new law will not help.
The change could bring a new law that will prohibit billboards from September of the next year and limit them to the I. class roads.
Criticals indicate that the rules for the deterioration of illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same as yet.
And the offices are not taking it so.
Companys can continue to make decades to hundreds of million crowns annually and no one can be able on them.
For example, the billboard on Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials well know her: the Czech Republic of the Czech Republic is currently conducting three administrative procedures for billboards.
The company is threatening in every trisetticial procedure.
It is more advertising that has been located without allowing in the I. class's protective street.
The management is not yet finished, says Jaroslav Mraz, the Chairman of the Czech Republic of Transport Board.
The advertising, which is interested at Currently.cz, even though it is not yet figured in these cases, soon to them, but with the greatest probability.
According to the speaker RSD Nina Ledvin, the company did not respond to repeated written challenges to eliminate, and the case would be achieved to the national table and then probably to the magistrate officials.
Commerce Billboard company belongs to those suspicious companies that are not able to contact.
No posts and the official seat on the Crwk cancelled more than six years ago.
There isn't even one who's worth her.
In the past, the company's mail went to the southern businessman of Anton Fischer, who had heard anxiety with the leader of the Czech Mark Hyundai.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard finds and offers it to the investors, but in the past he refused any association.
In the same year, when RSD began to take up the currently.cz interest in the advertising in Lipno, Fischer allowed the State officers to send a letter to the secret company Commerz Billboard to his pen, where the new company seems to be sitting.
However, no one has received from this address to the remote administrators yet.
It's a fucking fight.
Similar silence or untransparency changes in the seat are not unusual.
One company, we gradually gave up to two million crowns, a few years ago.
She just changed her name and ICO, and there was nothing to solve.
The executor returned the case, the advertising continued, maybe in other places.
We are against similar companies and their business practices quite impatient.
It's like a battle with angry monkeys, it admits under the submination of the preservation of anonymity one of the officers.
The new law in this regard is still no one to resolve.
Currently.ch has spoken with a number of lawyers who have faced the problem.
There's no activity yet.
Instead, the lawyers who wanted to prolong the termin for the preservation of billboards in the main Czech communications.
The government refused.
Billboards are not only for the national but also national and general policies very sensitive and sometimes a shizofrene topic.
On the one hand, the Community request is on their limitations, and on the other hand it is self-inspected in pre-election campaigns.
I don't stop the relatively involved idea that if something doesn't work, it's necessary to change the laws.
The agricultors in this year get less wheat, but more wheat and macus, they consider statistics.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistics Authority, the greenhouse glass will be less than 6.7 per cent of the year.
However, the annual level exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
Instead, the glassing of the grid (3.9 per cent) and the maca (2.5 per cent).
It will be 6,7 percent lower than the lone.
The farmers switch about 7.2 million tonnes of bullets.
This is based on a review that the Czech Statistics Authority has published, according to the state of 15 July.
The first review was more pessimistic than a month ago, and he assumed a decimal decline against the lance.
The lone glass of cereals, but it was excessive.
The annual level exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, it'll be higher for the year's shield of the cup and the rock.
The Greek pigs decrease about 3.9 percent more than a year ago when they got under 1.256 million tons.
The annual mask level may be 2.5 per cent higher than lower.
The estimated reduction of the production of cereals is caused by decreasing the hectare expenditure of 3.7 per cent to 5.71 tonnes of he ́ru, so reducing the axis of the area.
The farmers have three percent of the field less.
The ozim wheat, which is the most important wheat for the Czech Republic, is decreased by 3.3 percent in the year according to the assessment.
Farmers sent her to more fields.
However, a lower hectare cost will be signed at the decline, which decreases to 6.04 tonnes.
About five-year statistical decrease is assumed in the cattle of a beer, which is most commonly used for the production of beer.
The decreased decrease of staff areas is 15,2 per cent but even less than the hectare.
Instead, the olive vegetables are born by 6.3 percent more.
It also increases the glass of grass.
The Statistics Agency estimates 1.305 million tonnes, which is more contrary to the lonestrial.
Desktops also increased by 7.3 percent.
The hectare cost, but it will be 3.2 percent lower than the lone.
The annual rates level exceeds the decade average of 13,3 per cent, but the set is on a third-year-old border more than ten years ago.
In the last four years, the field is also coming with a make.
This year, the farmers sent him to 35.543 hectares.
In 2008, when the mob in Czech grows in records of 70,000 hectares, it is a half field.
Thanks to the extension of the literal areas, the annual glass of the maca will be richer.
It is 2.5 percent to 27 423 tonnes.
But the hectare cost will be less than 6.1 percent.

Leaving and empty houses in the centre of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you're walking around them daily.
One of the most crucial examples of unused and empty houses is a light building of an ex-IPB seat in the Senovage site.
She had to work as a hotel for a long time.
But nothing still.
That you need to build a new and new apartments and offices in metropolis?
And what to use the current, often valuable and protected textonics?
Directly in the centre of Prague in the area of Vaklav is a number of active houses, which, even through their position, size and often and memory protection only are empty and eat empty.
Incapacities in the center we have chosen through the Empty Project.ch, which maps the time of empty inability in the Czech territory.
The houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, untransparent relations between companies or belong to a State who does not want them or does not want to be released.
Empty houses are more in Czech than homeless people.
Whether owners pay special tax for them, he wants initiative
They almost shot Fidel Castra, and Hitler's brother lived there.

Clinton's husbands won $10,6 million.
Trump refuses to publish its tax recognition.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, president Bill Clinton, won $10,6 million in the year.
More than a million dollars were put to Clinton on charity.
The majority of Clinton's income -- over six million dollars -- is for their evidence.
Trump rejects his tax recognition.
The candidate of the American Democrats to the presidential office of Hillary Clinton published its tax evidence on Friday, which increased the pressure of her Republican subsidiary Donald Trump to act the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, president Bill Clinton, won $10,6 million in the year, announced the AP Agency.
The majority of Clinton's revenue - over six million dollars - is for their statements, mostly from the period before April 2015 when Clinton started its campaign before elections.
The tax report showed that the husbands of Clinton had taken a federal tax of 34,2 per cent income, and then the tax of the income at the state and local level of nine per cent.
Thus, in total, they paid 43.2 per cent of income.
But Trump has a problem with a similar step, he has not yet decided to publish tax recognition.
It's sure that Donald Trump doesn't pay any tax at all, he wrote Clinton on Twitter a few minutes after his confession was published.
Clinton's repeatedly returning to the secret around Trump's income, in addition to to provoking doubts whether her support is as rich as he claims, the AP Agency has introduced.
Trump's name is estimated to billion dollars.
The lower expenditure would damage the story of the Republican candidate as a successful undertaking.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is candidate to the post of the Vice-President in the Tandem with the former lady, has published a report of his tax charges in the last ten years.
Jointly, their wife, Anne Holton, gave 7.5 percent of their expenditure on charity, and on the lone fees, they took 25.6 per cent of the expenditure.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) the virus was unrespected.
On the north - east of Nigeria, there is an extraordinary expectation of children against the opposite, because there were two children protected by this disease.
In Africa, the consequences were incurred two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian Government announced that in Borno, millions of children and four million other in the states of surrounding.
The Nigerian military rats on Friday, according to the AP Agency, transported vaccines against children's turn to the north-east part of the country in which the islamic terrorists acted from Boko Haram.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the virus had been burning unspecifiedly in many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram in the past defended the expectation and the doctors even killed.
Their attacks also deceived the doctors to get into the place where children were found in turn.
Both obtained battles came with rivers from Nigeria, newly released from Boko Haram.
The Director of the WHO Section responsible for the elimination of the turn of the Michel Zaffran BBC station said that expectation in Nigeria comes for the next week.
In the state of Borno, the islamic radical Boko Haram group acted.
The area was accessible to international organizations and government until the beginning of the year when Boko Haram was in this part of the country in the primary way to weak.
The Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole admitted that the new cases of rotation are a great disappointment for the land, because Nigeria wanted to report that the round was cut off in it next year.
The WHO warned that although the disease had not occurred for two years, she was spread between children.
Now they'll be kids at age of five.
In 2012, the half of all the cases of the world's turn was found in Nigeria.
While in 1988 it was still in 125 countries, it is now only in three - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
Papa met former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the inspired stories of fallen women.
Pape František met twenty former prostitutes that were avoided by the police from the gang of sandwichs.
Papa listened to their hard life stories and invited them to see the future with confidence.
František wanted to warn this meeting of trafficking with people and call for strengthening the fight against him.
Pape František met twenty former prostitutes in Rome, which the police freed from the power of the gang of the sandwich.
The capital of the Catholic Church listened to the inspired stories of the fallen women and then invited them to see the future with confidence, introducing the Vatican speaker.
Among the former prostitutes he visited was six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average square moves around 30.
All of them, according to Vatican during the needed prostitution, were exposed to cruel physical violence.
František wanted to take attention to trafficking with people and call for strengthening the fight against him, introducing the Papa's speaker.
Frantiszek often warns about judges of people in the area of the company.
For example, on Thursday, he enjoyed Syrian birds who arrived in Vatican in April and in June by his personal invitation.
France's going to hit the jahadists' producers.
Without the Muslims' help, it won't happen.
France is in the fight against the radical islamism to help the Muslims themselves.
In addition, the Government of Prime Minister Manuel Valle wants essential changes in the function of mixing and education of spirituality.
We have closed 20 mixtures and prayer.
And they're going to follow, reported the Minister inside.
In the land it works over a hundred jihadists manufactured.
"When the Muslims are helping the state in fighting those who violate public freedom, it will be more difficult for France to ensure this freedom recognition," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, they are determined to preach in mixtures and prayers only the immigrants who were trained in France.
At the same time, he wants to stop financing mixing from the bill.
Currently, about 20 percent of money comes from the foreign for the building of new mixtures, most from Marokko, Algeria and the Pays of Persian Value.
Even so, it is enough to meet the preachers who can seem radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that the Islam is compatible with democracy," added the Prime Minister.
The key to ensuring the fulfillment of these objectives will be the new French islamic mission.
This should work as a bridge between the secondary state and the Muslim minority.
There's no money from the neighborhood.
In the country, the French issue is now implemented in 2005, which was founded by the former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
It had already contributed to the transparency of financial flows between mixtures and countries that fund their building.
But the institutions were soon insulted of the internal division and rivality.
"It's a complete failure," stated Valls recently.
On the French political scene, Charlie Hebdo was deployed in January 2015 in the debate on a new institution that replaces the non-essential order.
All other terrorist attacks in France have succeeded, which, in the name of the Islamic State, have made radicalization of islamists.
The French Minister inside Bernard Cazeneve has recently heard that the new mandate will occur in October.
It will have two main tasks - ensuring the financing of mixing from home resources and also monitoring the property.
In the meantime, it is not a place where it will buy money not only to build new mixtures but also to different educational centres.
But it's thinking about a few of them.
One of them is a special tax or a tax on food hail.
The sales would be paying for food in practice for the certificate.
Then part of these money would just travel to the cash.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French beneficiaries who are released to Mekka.
Every year, they go about 30,000 in the traditional field to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, in the mixtures in the future, only the publishers who have passed by special educational programmes at the French universities should be implemented.
This should ensure that the preaching is in accordance with democracy.
We'll close radical mixtures.
The French government is at the same time in the cover against radicals.
And the other will follow, he has recently announced the Ministry of the Inside.
In France there is no place for those who report hate in mixture and do not respect some principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country, according to estimates, approximately 2500 mixtures and prayers.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are affected by radical islamism.
Since 2012, the offices have exempted approximately 80 money, and in some other decades they consider it.
Not everyone thinks that the government's steps are able to deal with radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do it the same.
This does not happen in mixtures, young people are radicalized on the Internet, introduced Severine Labat, a expert from the National Centre for Research.

The two-second-flow-beginning sticked in 9,969 seconds.
In the main stage, he was waiting for him in the fifth Baugé, which already has a bronz from Ria in the team sprint.
Although Kelemen finally touched the experienced France, however, he looked at the procedure.
With a great performance, the Jason Kenny's gold covered.

The additional maximum (3:51,659), which belonged to the British four years since the olympiade in London, improved more than a second.
Young Doctors press: They want fresh wind in the coast
The representatives of young doctors have meet to approve new steps in their new relationship.
The Council of Youth Physicians (JDC) with the British Medical Association (BMA) must request a full advice for supporting other operating actions from beginning September.
JDC states that the Ministers could not resolve questions on the matter of the matter.
Young doctors and medical students in July announced the refus with BMA agreed.
It was rejected 58 % of its members who had taken the elections.
In the letter to the members published on Thursday night on Twitter, President JDC Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained "and still quiet" to questions that would lead to refusal of the contract.
She said: "In this light, the JDC exercising power by voting decided to reject and request a new formal negotiation in all matters."
In response to silence by the Government today, the JDC Executive Board has formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council with a view to approving the running programme of threatened trade action from the beginning of September.
Spor led young doctors this year to report to six stages, including the first general stages in the NHS history.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawan, rejected after decision to refuse agreed submissions with the BMA recommended.
The members of BMA at meetings before voting before 54,000 young doctors and medical students said that the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After voting, the Minister of Health said that with the medicals in England would be a burden.
Russia and Turkey: the "inactive" association?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian leaders and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce the formal end of eight months of long word war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish anti-palace in the hall of the Palace in Petrohrada, I had the idea that Ankara wanted more demands.
It happened to give up your hands, yes.
But Putin wasn't laughing and at the same time exhibited the heat, and it also according to his demanded standards.
Recept Tayyip Erdogan said repeatedly about his "friendly friend" Mr. Putino - five times, as one of the reports says.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that the relations with Russia would not only return to their level before the crisis, but will be even better.
On the next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was being treated as if nothing was wrong.
According to me, his surprise expressed exactly the opposite.
But the survivoring cold that excited from Putina showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The actual cause of the crisis was the first thing he changed in his introductory words: the Shoot of the Russian War Airport by Tureck on Syrian Aviations.
Moscow's reaction was tough at that time.
Putin split the rounds around him, and Ankara was accused of murdering Moscow.
The worst thing was that it came from a genuine friend.
Rebuilding a trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed.
The controlled media after months led a total campaign against Ankara.
At once, it looked like the Turks could do everything.
More important was the accusation of the higher state representatives that Erdogan’s own family had benefits from the illegal trade with poverty in the parts of Syria controlled by the Islamic State.
The guy's cutting up this.
But the official message came to Peter that it was time to move forward.
The end of the end of this meeting was only because Putin had received a excuse from President Erdogan.
Russia could announce some victory too.
For Ankara, the contributions are an advancement declaration.
In the first row, Erdogan was the past month during an unexpected shot, so he was free of power and therefore all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey also appear to have been exhausted.
There is also an economic motive.
The Russian sanctions had a strong impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights, which each year transport a number of million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey.
This amount was decreased by 90 %.
This is about Russia, tour operators and charter companies, where they are going to breathe when it comes to the renewal of the flights.
It makes it on the Mediterranean road by moving in the conclusion of its own.
Even this week, the state television has promised more flexible fruit and greenine when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey will be allowed again.
"Turiste there, back here," as the report reported in Vedémete's newspapers.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara's going to the West for what he thinks of a chabu reaction to the trial of reverse.
Furthermore, the persistent inviolence of long-term discussions on the entry into the EU and the entrance of Putina - which will press to use and overcome the coal of Turkey with the Western.
The Russian leader certainly obtained bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the chosen bodies after trying to get a gun.
You must understand that for Moscow, who has deeply rooted fear of the change in the regime, it is given.
So the summit in this pumped, direct-sea palace of Russia and Turkey has enabled me to introduce what one of the analyses described me as “incompatible connections”: how the forces of two countries that feel rejected and used by the Western.
Yet, despite the public manifestation of mutual peace, these two countries have fundamental differences.
It is Syria, where Moscow has recently been built in the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on the opposite sides.
It could be said that after the three-hour introduction discussions, both presidents on the print have not yet changed the question.
The Turkish Chairman chose the answers to the question of divisions between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no agreement on the basis of which both States could find a common speech in the issue of Syria.
But after months of enemy - and because of the risk of a complete disaster when the NATO Turkko member struck the Russian war airport - it is certainly better that both leaders speak at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the executive manager of the bank, the RBS mark must be drawn into the role of back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland will lose for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan said the BBC Scotland station that the RBS tag was connected to global ambitions of the bank.
She was deceived when she went eight years ago and had to be solved from the debt.
At that time, strategic labels used the ‘RBS’ to protect the final marks of consumer funds.
There were millions of dollars issued for the sponsoring of the international sport, from the ragby champion of Six Nations after Winbledom's campaign of Andy Marray.
But now it was decided that it was better to give more out of the national marks.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used in Scotland customers, but will run new trades.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the centre and coding action on the burst, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and North Ireland.
There are other, smaller marks for private banking, which will get more in front - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the journey to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered our questions to Ross McEwan.
The BBC station of Scotland said: "The RBS will stop being our investor mark and the label for which our employees work because we now become much more marks."
Because the bank itself became a global mark, it became a global mark and RBS.
Now I say we have no global aspiration anymore, we have an attempt to put on the home scene.
Each of these marks will mean something very different in their own communities and our workers will work under these tags.
RBS has already stated that it has continued to sponsorize the Six Nations championship, prepared the profile of individual sport sponsoring marks.
"The time was a suitable time for us, and they moved to the mark because the fundamental question (which we ask) is how to focus on it, and they became a better customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical when they said that we would be a great bank for customers and they represented those tags.
But together with how we focused on the needs of clients, not on our own, I think that there is a lot of changes.
We can recall these tags again, I think it's been the right time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on the horse of Predilection led to goal 3000. winning
Dector distracts the Spanish after double victory in Newmarket brought him 3000 victories
Jocky Frankie Dettors had 3000 victories in Britain in Newmarket on Friday.
This milk has reached his second victory tonight on his local trace - on the horse of predilection, who trains John Gosden.
The fifty-five-year Italian is the sixteen-year-old cheese, which has achieved such a result in the rain.
His leaders are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug ́ith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-fold champion of the decoration of Detori, who had earlier won on the horse Ghayar, said, "It's special."
I'm very cool because my family's here too.
I'm incredible that it happened in Newmarket, because I've been shot 30 years ago.
It's not a bitter action, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm getting up and I'm very grateful.
Dector collects congratulations when they bring predilection after victory
Two jucky men of this milk have reached in interruptions - a campaign of Richard Johnson and a 20-fold campaign on the pension Sir Anthony McCoy, which led over 4 300 winners during his career.
Lester Piggott, ninethisable winner Derby, 4 493 winners in the career
Frankie is one of the best hooks of modern times, and it is not surprising that he has reached a boy who has reached only a few horsemen before him.
He's a lonely and strong, but it's just his tactic fistron that distinguishes him from the final riders in reality.
He's an amazing ambassador of destructions, his surprise and charism have attached fans to this sport for a long time.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn't just come about weeks and big achievements, he would have 6000 winners!
Of course, Frankie has made a victory in British most part of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a living respect, which is good for British adequate sport, but it is more important that he is an incredible Church.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous years of shock
Since the years of finishes after a year-shopping - Frankie Dettori was a britain's comparable decades of two decades.
It was like a boss on the mountain road.
Increasing number of winners of big trains, including his famous "velope seven" in Ascot, but he also survived the airport and had a prohibition of starting for drugs.
Three years ago, he was stagnous when he returned after 6 months of start, but showed an incredible internal force and all doubters, despite the best form.
And maybe that's the consequences - Dector has already declared that he would continue to carry up at least up to 50 years.
The Russian President Putin lost the presidential office of Sergei Ivanov
The Russian president Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from the Chairman of the Office.
Ivanov was one of the nearest Putin's cooperation after many years.
Thirty-six-year Ivanov was appointed by a special representative for environment and transport.
The Kremla statement states that Putin “slipped Ivanov from his service to the head of the Russian presidential office”, but it was not mentioned.
His place is transferred by Anton Vajno, who was the representative of Ivanov since 2012.
Fourty-four years old Wayno was a diplomate before.
He was born in the main city of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, promoted the Pressive State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the ambassador in Tokyo.
On the websites (Russian) it is noted that the Chairman of the Chairman of the Protocol and the President's offices later.
At the name of Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your State's head's activities in the meaning of laws and controls in which way your guidelines are respected.
Putin on Friday, the Russian TV station pointed out that Ivanov asked her to be released from the station and recommended to replace her rightly.
Convinced smiles?
This step was mysterious to Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was a long time for one of the closest collaborators of Vladimira Putina, and like Putin worked for KGB.
As the president's office head, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At meeting with President Putin, who sent the state television, both men declared that the president's office's office was on their own request.
But the smiles in the camera have only convinced a few people - especially now, closely before the parliamentary elections.
So is it the successor of a mighty struggle?
No one knows that yet.
But the official claim that a man who had ever been viewed as a possible president once wants to lead the Russian ecological policy once had a great uncertainty.
On the Kremlu pages, notes are quoted to Putino, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you to talk to this very urgent post, even to say a problem post, I believed for four years.
I seemed to be a president's head for four years and eight months.
The post of Ivan was taken in January 2011.
Previously, he stopped the president of the government and the Minister of Defence.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and formerly, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 90s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), who replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed by his representative.
When Putin reached the power, he named Ivan as one of his five closest collaborators.
It was even speculated that Ivanov could be a representative of Putina in the front of the state after his second election period, because the third period would be anti-determined for Putina.
But this post took another near Putin's collaboration with Dmitrij Medvedev.
Putin became a Prime Minister before returning to the presidential Office at only three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the mystery of the criminal, was released after the recorder's appointment.
Gibson was involved in the physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The ABC and CBS television stations producing the series reported in the joint declaration of its release.
Gibson, who played a special agent of Aaron Hoōner, apologized on Thursday before he announced his exit.
There were creative divisions on scene and accidents.
I'm sorry that it happened," he said in the statement.
According to the statement of the ABC and CBS TV stations, the details are about how Gibson's station will disappear from the series that follows the stories of the FBI agents' team about something after.
The four-five-year heric, who praised the main role in the Dharm and Greg Sitch, was in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of the criminal and during the last twelve years I gave them heart and soul," Gibson said in his statement, which he delivered on Friday.
I hoped I'd be in it until the end, but it couldn't be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, herds, our team, and especially to the beautiful fans in which this show could have been hoped.
The return of the series to the twelveth series is expected on September 28.
In the town of Banff, they came in the garden of fish.
The man from the town of Banff asked for help to identify the fish that had appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain seems that 75 pounds of fish can be the sand corners that left the water wheat there.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a short film on the Periscope channel in view of his finding that someone could help him to explain how about 5 metres of fish in his garden were found.
Queensferry Crossing: Most now connects with Fife
Project for 1.35 billion frees must be completed until May 2017
The engineers connected the north area and Queensferry Crossing and Viduct - then the bridge now connects with Fife.
It is therefore the first of the four conclusions between the "speaks of floor", which are now completed about each of the three pylons of the pool.
The part of the pool from Fife is now 600 meters long and weights 30,000 tonnes.
There are 10 000 tonnes of iron and 20 000 tonnes of beton and 46 cottons.
The project for 1.35 billion frees must be completed until May 2017.
The economic secretary Keith Brown has visited the building today and was among the first who came from the pe ́ny to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historical moment and a symbolic moment of building Queensferry Crossing.
For this project, we all have witnessed how building engineers used more than 30,000 tonnes of beton and steel for this part of the pool.
Despite the massive dimensions and the weight of the pool, the conclusion between the viduct and the broadband of a delicate operation required extraordinary accuracy.
At its place, there is now more than 79% of the total area of the pool, the beton for the last part of the area is now driven into Rosyth, so the whole area is ready to raise up to the pool.
Michael Martin, leader of the Forth Crossing Brie Constructor project, said: “The conclusion of building every pont is an important milk.
This conclusion represents a tissue of earthquake for this project.
After installing the last part of the road area and connecting it to the widespread North Tower area, we had to close the last space north side - direction to the peʹna.
This we made by providing the northern viduct of 700 miles southern direction.
This was a mass and at the same time a very delicate operation.
Mass because the viduct is 222 metres long, it weighs approximately 6 000 tonnes, and it was necessary to take it with a weight of approximately 3 %.
It's delicate because the tolerance with which he worked was very small - only a few millimeters in every direction.
Everything's been very lucky.
Saving in Moelfree Bay: Three men are “happy that they are alive”
Three men are “happy that they are alive” after the waters fell out of their fishing ships at ́lesey.
Moelfree RNLI's sales station announced a breakfast on Friday at 13:20 of the British Soviet Time after the invasion of the incident in Moelfre's bathroom.
All three men tried to flee in security while their boat continued unsettledly.
"We've seen their boat crossing in their neighborhood and attacked us the worst," said Moelfree Vince Jones.
“The powerful wind took him away from them before we went out,” he added.
Two men saved the local fisheries ship, the third man at 60 years was found without a saved news on the way the battles were held.
Everyone was transferred to the coast of the sauve wood and transfers back to the station of salvation ships
Jones said: “Tree men in the water are happy that they are alive and completely without hurt.
The engine of the ship had a lana for the switch, but it came to his disconnection from the person that led the ship when it came to turn.
Somebody's thrown over those boys holding a protective hand.
The judge refuses to resolve the case because of the Witness woman.
Peter Tluchoř is one of the three cases which, according to the claims, had to get from the Prime Minister of Intime and his current cabinet Jana Nagy's political traffic, thus lucrati post for a political procedure.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Snader, Fuks and Tluchoř enabled him to reject.
Then they appeared on the impact posts in the state firms.
It is therefore why they were also suspicious of the tax and ended for a month in the committee.
According to the court, however, it was unlawful, and they expected a total of 2 million crowns.
The teacher now comes as a witness in the cup, and it is after the command of the High Court.
His wife works in court building on the Fruit Market and resolves civil disputes.
However, he wants to be cautious to judge Helena King (resolves criminal matters - etc. red.) and to preach possible meetings.
The case, obviously, will be concerned by another Prague court surrounding.
The king's guilt has already been two times awarded to John Netime, before Nagy.
It was an informal misuse of military science to follow the first wife of Prime Minister of Time Radka.
In this case, Tluchor wasn't figured.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, it's about an unexpected reaction.
I think the independence can't be so determined to be excluded by the court if the Witnesses have a wife or a family in the court.
I'm afraid he shouldn't judge anything at all, he noticed for a journal.
"I don't think it's like a bullet," he added.
In the case of political traffic is also charged by Roman Boček, former officer.
According to his lawyer, Petra Toman would have an opportunity to succeed.
The Court of Auditors for Prague 1 negotiated on 13 June a complaint by the president of the Prime Minister Petra Nevertime Jana Nagyová (that's not time) and other accused of the disuse of the military report.
The photo is coming with the husband to the court.
She had to resolve the announcements about Peroutk.
For example, the exposure wife had to judge President Miloshe Zeman's announcements on the democratic pre-governmental journalist Ferdinanda Peroutkovi.
He said that he was sympathy with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schools is already dead!
The girl apparently died at the aircraft of associated forces.
She went to Syria with her two old friends and fled along with the lonelies from the London Airport Gatwick.
The British Ministry is inside a report of her death.
Young Londonians who fled from home were secretly transferred to Syria through the Turkish border, according to the police.
Shamima Beguma, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana were designed by the media for their other former associate from the London School Bethnal Green Aëmy.
The case of Loni has caused a huge wave of attention and also pressure between Britain and Turkey.
The British security records believe that about 600 British Muslims have been visited to Syria, from which about 50 young women and girls.
A number of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home represent a terrorist threat for British.
Working dreams for a hundreds of payments.
Very payable jobs you don't even want high school.
That looks like the first view of the actor's work.
And often to the other one.
The result is not only to the Czech situations extremely high payment (in Prague you're working in IT up to 180 000 Kč), but also to extreme advantages.
D'em is a huge lack of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
According to estimates, there are at least 20 000 IT specialists in Czech.
The most searched includes software, developers, network engineers and application specialists according to Grafton's personal agency.
The candidates can choose among some of the job offers.
So it does not support the candidate on the job, but the job on the candidate position, comments Jitka Součova, the marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school isn't needed.
Instead, high school education is not needed for students.
High School Education means a good basis and is a general indicator of the intellectual and educational indicator of the candidate, but it is often not much common with the knowledge of development.
Continue to learn new things, which once the high school is not replaced, says Peter Kubačka, Director Monster Career CZ.
It's most likely to be in Prague.
The salaries of the actors are moved over the Republic's prospect.
For the most money they'll come to Prague and Brna, it's no longer such hit-paradise in the regions.
"The salaries in Brna are comparable to those praises," confirms Cubačka.
The technical directors will reach the highest expenditure.
In Prague and Brna, 120 000 - 180 000 Cz.
In the final regions, it is lower than 80 000 Kč.
Questions are also IT project managers.
When they arrive, they can win 60,000 - 100,000 kids.
The fight is about the absoluteity.
While in some professions, the decisions often must go to the office of work, they do not pay it to the employees.
It is the same that companies should move and pay a professional from another company, and they will be obtained by the absolute.
They can train him according to their own.
They won't be insulted without a tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is in every profession, but the aids are needed at least to listen to English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is needed for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we meet a number of cases when companies are looking for a professionally educational and experienced person and are only satisfied with the average knowledge of English.
However, for example, the employee controls more foreign speech, it is interesting for his employee because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds Director Kubačka.
John in Googl, there they are.
The Czech workers can be silent to the workers in Googla.
Of course, it is a positive job for them, the opportunity to work from home or different decreased accounts, not only for mothers.
"First weeks after the birth of a child, he gives the company awarded four," says Martin Jonek, Google speaker.
Heating also provides health care for employees and family, food, transport, education, wellness or massage directly on the workplace.
Whoever wants to educate is green, and doesn't matter what the new one wants to do.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
Such free is also no longer to be prevented.
healthy dinner (in some places and dinner and dinner) is available every day.
Moreover, in all offices, there are such microcookings where people find a healthy boy, speaker.
And not to get out of anything, so he doesn't want to get into the box that the employees can take home tonight.
What about these incredible advantages in Czech?
Create creative and motivating!
"For Google, it is not important that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, movement or development, ideas and innovative solutions," adds the speaker.
The United Nations criticized Bulgaria for the criminalization of flights.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, U.S. Commissioner for Human Rights, charged Bulgaria on Thursday that systematic violation of human rights on criminalization of flights.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian Government "was a serious concern for Bulgaria's international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in the statement.
He noted that "is especially anxious to be a witness to how important and influential public persons express public support for criminal armed fights, which, in turn, organize hung on flights at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
"One of the most serious problems is that, at the same time, everyone who goes through the Bulgarian territory is automatically arrested," Zeid emphasized.
And what's worse -- they are often punished and conceived - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the land.
Their attempts to go out of the country are criminalized, despite that everyone has the right to leave any country, in particular its own rights, according to international rights.
Bulgaria held 14,000 migrants for the same period for 21,000.
Poquemon Go - health and happiness that will be paid
It's fascinating to watch the world changes.
A number of people in the past decades lamentate that teenages and children are not playing outside and gives the preference to free time in front of screens.
Pokemon leads people from the chat and leads them to activity.
The time spent before screens was swimming on TV, posted on video games and the newest on smart phones.
It's great to follow that activities and activities are not uninterested.
I, of course, talk about the mode that is Pokémon Go, found on stations that first appeared in the video games at the end of the 90s (after there was a drawn series, playing cards and other).
Like in many cultural phenomenons, there has occurred before the introduction of this new game at the beginning of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand to reduce interest.
The introduction in other countries was then delayed because of the potential interest that led to the transfer of servers.
Pokemon Ga got for a few days more than Tinder and the same as Twitter.
How does that work?
In short, players on a smart phone are going out to search for Poquemons who follow GPS, and when they find them, they can be "foto" (by the phone shoot) or "capture".
Manie appreciates the generation that played in the younger game, brings her out of the seat and women out to search for Pokemony.
In the United States, this game has made a significant increase in the number of steps that the "average" person will make every day.
The Cardiogram application for smart hours from Applu, following 35,000 persons, recently reported to Washington Post that during two days since the game started, the number of followed people who practiced every day for 30 minutes went from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who Pokemon Go plays - only sees gross data on levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns trying to "found 30", "release from the gateway" and "being active every day" fell on an unnatural ground, because the majority of public health-related messages are noble and designed to people who don't look well.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who practice regularly reduce the risk of cancer disease or depression.
Physical activity is involved in the control of weight, high blood pressure, sugar and a long list of profits that we can't all indicate here.
But the beauty of the Pokemon Game is in the way people go out and do something that is fun.
So you cover three pillars of health -- movement, fresh air and sunpaper, and fun.
Some people even get new friends when they're junking for pokemen.
As soon as it is, they will, of course, also find the nudity patterns that are looking for any inclination to be able to be able.
Yeah, somebody can go into the door.
What, like?
He's been in the middle.
At their time for smart phones, like Fitbit, they could follow our activity, but they didn't give us to it, and they did something like that in this game.
The news is looking and interested in it at a certain moment.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokemons, there will be further games that will combine and reality with activity in the world and help a number of people in moving for activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles won gold in multiple battles of women
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simon Biles is immune against all that.
Dynamic on the cross.
Don't wear it on the floor.
Everyone's on the right hands.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, a olympical champion.
The nineteenth-year-old American gimnasty went on Thursday directly after the title in multiple battles and finally overcome full lines under olympical reflectors.
The total outcome of 62.1998 confirmed its spring before the silver medalist and the member of the team of Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliyou Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday, during the turning on the board in the terminal, multiple individual battles in sports. Gymnastics on the 2016 Olympics Soviets in the Brazilian Riu de Janeir.
Billes became the fourth American in a series of winning more battle, and the fifth totally when she confirmed her story of the best gimnastics of her generation and perhaps the best at all.
When her total final evaluation was on the table and its long road until this moment, it appeared on the face of the tears.
This success is set up in the same ligue of individual athletes of their time, such as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Billes has dominated her sport last three years, has won 15 medals on the world championates - especially 10 golden. Its glorious compositions are ambitions and accuracy and olympical champion in 1984, Mary Lou Retton called her as the "best gymnast as she had ever seen".
The final test was waiting for her in Brazil, not even between Biles and the rest of the battles, but between herself and the burden of too big expectations.
Anything else than returning home to his family in Spring in Texas with the hand of golden medals, it would be considered disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman are covered after victory of gold and silver medailles in a woman's final multi-flying single on 2016 olympics games in Brazil Riu de Janeiru on Thursday.
The Biles obtained on Wednesday, when she was as a guardian in the celebration of the National Team Coordinator of Marthy Karoly.
Billes continues that during her long road to the top, she never looked forward, but it's not totally true.
The part of its compositions in the simple - that contains a typical three-three salto with a double turn - is placed in a Latin music, which would just go home, to the street outside the olympical arenin in Riu.
That's not a case.
The girl adopted her parents as a bathroom, and her talent discovered the mother of Aimee Boorman's trainer to the bodyway where Boorman was trained and where he gained power.
Competition hasn't spent since 2013 - it's a victory seed that can continue as Billes will.
Although Mustafin took a short leader through two islands, it was just an illusion.
The cladine and simple - where Biles' shampionates worldwide - are waiting.
She returned to her head with 15,433 points to the station - and ended with 15,933 points in the free.
Raisman's kidnapped her as they waited for the final score - only formality - and around red, white and blue shadows appeared to Billes' tears when the desires that she ever wrote in the journal were fulfilled.
Vicon Raisman was so little payment for olympy four years ago, when she shared the third trip with Mustafin, but then eat bronze for the sum of three best compositions.
This time, the twenty-five-year-old team team, which the Americans call "babcha", was about enough forward.
After her simple sends, she sent a gap of air powder, obtained by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles's contribution, which this nineteen-year-old atlete placed on Twitter this week, where he became a complete hit, completely new importance:
Police: Three victims in the case of a series killer shot when listening to music in the car

The mother of a six-year-old child with a microchefale: "His status improves"
Edmund Pi ́uto, as the number of children of his mother, loves songs, players, and, of course, also his mother.
But in a distance from its kind of cups, a microcephalia, which is an investigator of genetic infections that his mother, Elizabeth Pi, did not know during pregnancy.
When he came home first, I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
What's not true - you're prepared for this," she said.
She and her wife Vincent learned that Edmund may never knows and that she may not even survive.
Some doctors even wanted to be placed in the constitution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people did not do this anymore today," explains Pi'ut.
Edmund's walking with a walker.
Until three years, he was not able to sit down, and he's not talking yet.
Some borders are already filling slowly.
He's coming with the bathroom and running on the road.
He also plays much with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth leads the signic word that Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
"We teach him a sign speech," said Pi'ut for CBS News.
But it's not a running sign - says Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephalia may occur from a number of different states: genetic, such as Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused viruses, such as cocktails or Zika.
Symptoms and predicts may be significantly different.
It's too soon for it, and they could say how the effect of Zik's virus on the lives of the deceased.
Pi'ut's on the emotional tax that chooses an uncertain future.
I'm still asking, "What's going on?"
What's going on?
And she's still not sure.
I never wondered what a total predict is at the time, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
Pi'uth has a encouragement report for the mothers of all children suffering by born leaders caused by Zik's virus.
The situation is improved.
You know it's gonna be better.
You'll love your child and your child's gonna love you.

Krautmann said that the ground is strongly invasive from the middle.
The authorities noted that the valuable rain and payable roads requested salvation of residents from their homes during Tangipahoa periods and the cancellation of learning in five school areas.
The WWL station CBS site announced that, according to the older man from Tangipahoa, 200 homes were driving.
The people were evacuated into two churches, which are both shiped, but now.
The foreign elder of Robby Miller said that the offices saved 72 people and seven home animals that have been captured by high water.
In the foreign of Amite and town of Hammond, there were ships for those who were evacuated.
"I'll be able to come home when the water is coming to swallow," he said.
In the area of Tangipahoa in Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed, and local residents were available to a cup with sand that could take up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"Latest big flags we had here in March," said the manager of Lacy Landrum.
It seems to be similar to these pigs.
Rupert Lacy, a crisis manager in Harrison, in Mississippi state, stated that there is a sustainable rain on the March of Persia.
He said that a couple of homes were announced on Thursday, but on Friday, no of them had been revealed in the report.
Keith Townson, leader of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, lives in 40 years.
"I saw water in some places where I never saw it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "the boy shooted as a fucking shot", survived the shot in Philadelphia
According to the police, the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, and this week was a second shot on a child in 6 years in the city.
Parents of the child identified her as Mahaje Brown for CBS Philadel.
Parents say that the boy suffered a few shooting wounds, including weakness, feet, pause and breach, but when he was transported to the hospital, he was at home.
"He took that terrible power, his small body was spread as a rice," said his grandmother's station, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe that.
The boy's in a critical condition in the hospital, and he's undergoing a few operations.
The family for the station stated that the boy should be healed.
He had to go into the first class of the basic school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people shot in Germantown.
Another three men were shot: two in 29 years and one in 32 years.
One of the 29-year-old men is in the critical state, according to CBS Philadela, are two other victims in the stabilised state.
According to the station report, a child was found shot on the front seat of the vehicle with a ninety-five-year-old man in a critical state.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police could check if some of the wounded men could be a shooter.
CBS Philadel’s researcher station noted that there was probably a shot between some armed men.
In the place there were a hosts of an attack type of weapons that belonged to different attack weapons.
I mean, it was absolutely about the continuing battle.
The street was inhabitants on both sides of the traveler.
So it seems that there were a few armed fighting persons who were actively involved here," he said for the station of the Philadelphia police Anthony Ginaldi.
A few houses and vehicles were also placed in a position.
Nobody's arrested and the police is probably exploring video records from the camera.
The next six-year-old child, this time the girl, was shot into the past by the shot on Tuesday before the house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl's retreated, and the police still look for a suspicious.
Why are we Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
Just like this, I'm imagining a woman's gambling team for annual olympical games, and it's just a few of them.
First, I was on every yearly olympy since 1984 and the United States were never so dominant.
And secondly, in this team there are three guys, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the loading of this team, which supplements Aly Raisman, a Jewish pump, and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
The presence of the black and latin Americans on this sport's bridge was also deceived.
The gimnastical number one in the past four years was African.
Simon and Gabby were broken on the first and second point.
That means something.
In the last olympy, Gabby Dougals became a champion of olympics and America was awake.
Now the world could be a witness of an incredible accomplishment of the three-fold world victory of Simon Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, which had leaded to unexpected but mysterious gimnastical figures.
On Wednesday, Simone became a fourth American, who gained gold in a woman's more individual killing.
And the member of the team Aly Raisman got silver.
We're witnesses of the sports top, but it doesn't seem like this in the hours of gimnasty in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie were going to the Olympics team the same way as Aly and Madison.
They're "final five", because the next olympical games team will be composed only from four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karoly's train.
The fact is, however, that gimnastic is financially urgent sports and gimnastics train primarily in private gimnasty clubs that maintain parents who pay costs for trains, equipment, routes, dress, charges for competition, hotel accommodation (for trainers and their confidence and families). And this is not all away.
Most of these sport clubs are in rich areas that can support activities.
In these clubs, all trains and the families of gimnasts and gymnastics are a cost and commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started in the gymnastics.
It is our obligation to bring a gimnasty train, which is more available and available to communities without number of young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I found a gimnasty idea 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or with low costs in Harle for more than 15,000 young people in the city (over the black and Spanish) and we trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (My town), where we will provide quality gymnastic to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and weigh this great olympical sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, intensity and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and the decision of thinking.
This combination means life-life contributions for good health, success in school and work.
Just inspiring this team will send us thousands of young girls who will want to make a gymnastic, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing the "feeling force" and wining the Olympic team of gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of everyone to be released on the road with healthy, strong and successful young women.
After refusing Jeremy Hunt, young doctors are ready to enter the other substances.
Ministers hoped that after the closure of the processed with the British Medical Association (BMA) will end the failure of change, but 58 per cent of 37 000 young doctors who had participated in the elections refused.
Hunt discovered in July the plans for exhaustion with the NHS was in “nobody’s land and another delay would have a damage effect on employees and patients.
Young doctors have already signed a new conjunction that includes changes in night and weekly working procedures with the aim of improving care in non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Committee for Youth Doctors in the report last night, stated: “Young doctors still have serious concerns regarding the injury, especially in the sense that the current working force crisis will grow and then the fair consequence of all the doctors.”
Eight weeks before the first group of physicians goes under a new conjunction, it is necessary to achieve progress and the time is coming.
The efforts of the BMA to resolve conflicts through negotiations have been met with an unexpected involvement of the doctor and often with a stated silence from the Government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, pressure for exciting and resolve the fears of young doctors."
This will not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last stage at the end of April, there were 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits, because sisters and specialists were allowed to represent doctors who were among protestants.
Ministers hoped that after closing the processed with the representative of the British Medical Association (BMA) will conclude the accidents relating to changes.
BMA wants a higher payment for weekend work for 54,000 young doctors who would be subject to the subject.
Daniel Mortimer, president of NHS employees, invited young doctors to not enter any staff.
Mortimer said: “The treatment action will only be reached a little or nothing, but the pressure will occur on already so heavy teams and services and will increase fears, suffering and disturbment for patients, treatment staff and their families.”
In the past two months, we acted with the advice of young doctors, together with the Ministry of Health, and finally reacted positively to their concerns regarding the role of the supervisory and informant.
Employers hoped that the continuing position of involvement in other important issues - such as deployment, flexibility in schools, further training for those who return after breaking the career, costs to school, mutual recognition of objects, study freedom and distribution in payments between sexes - was a evidence of how seriously employees, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health take agreements achieved with BMA in November, November and May.
Medicinal treatment for sixty crowns per day may reduce the risk of infarct
Thousands of patients threatened with infarct will be able to use a drug that is over-containing about sixty coron (two lilies).
Ticagrelor blood bleeding reduces the risk of recovery in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is now given for 12 months after the infarct is produced to reduce the risk of death or other relief.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NHS watchdog NICE recommends to be given to people for four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
An infarct in England suffers about 140 000 people every year, and a quarter of them will reach further salvation or heart death.
The infarct and deaths are caused by the replacement of the tube that produces a relative layer on the walls of artery.
This layer may be cut off, it can result in the surface of grass, the blocking of the blood access to the heart and the result of heart infarct.
When the syringe is released, the cream can continue with the speech, block the blood leading into the brain and cause the brain murder.
People who have already sold an infarct have been exposed to a higher risk of further prevention.
Ticagrelor, which produces the British company AstraZeneca and which is sold under the name of Brilique, decreases the risk of the result of the injury.
It is recommended that patients get 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin two times daily.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the Centre for Assessment of Health, said: “Although the availability of the secondary prevention of treatment is available, there is a quarter of patients who have an infarct and who have other heart-reservation or death - often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repeat may have a significant negative impact on the quality of the patient’s life.
Ticagrelor is demonstrated in combination with aspirin in decreasing the risk of other heart reliefs and death in people who have already been infarct.
We are glad that, in the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand the possibilities of treatment that are available to many thousands of people who will be able to suffer.
Because information on the safety and safety of Ticagrelor - especially on the risk of blooding - are detailed over three years, treatment is not recommended for this time.
Computer culture has started to raise subcutaneous waters in the Muslims
The oldest city of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was revoked last year because of corruption, which was connected to the government report
Culture of political correction has led to the broadcasts in the Muslim communities, which is stated today in the government report.
The former Minister Sir Eric Pickles criticizes the police, electoral inspectors and advisers because they ignored the use of electors because of “ethnicity and religious sensitivity”.
The former community secretary, now the Governor of anti-coruption commitments, said that the fear of electors based on their religion is so bad that the police should make coronary and scared electors protect from election rooms.
He recommended that the electors with themselves take a document of identity and can show who they are when they were chosen.
At present, the chooser is enough to enter his name and address.
In the report, it continues to focus on the fingers of the person when the vote is revoked to bring an improper injury to prevent the choice of a person twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
Requests to receive more access to documents from the meeting and decisions adopted by the Official Committees or the Working Group.
"It is not only the protection against electoral undergoing but also the protection of the local government from larger corruption and financial dumbs that are in hand with it," he said.
She requested a report to Downing Street as a student of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets in Western London.
In the remote year, the Special Election Court decided that the Officer of the city of Lutfur Rahman should be revoked from its post after the conviction of corruption and illegal practices.
The Court concluded that Rahman "chinely" had a religious feeling of his Muslim communities and washed his criticism by accusations of racism and islamofobie.
Rahman, according to his words, “he led his campaign so that it was the religious duty of the dedicated Muslims to vote for”.
Up to 300 voices were discouraged or as a result of the stealing of identity when a person votes and issues someone else.
Sir Eric pointed out that there are evidence of subcutaneous evidence throughout the country.
He expressed a special concern for the subduction of the corresponding vote - which is stated that the elderly members of the Muslim community during— have developed a pressure on people to vote for the candidates they have chosen.
Sir Eric, on the photo, gave a few recommendations to clear the optional system, including the presentation of the authenticity document
His report states: “The evidence of the vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially for women and young people, was made a challenge to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in the communities who are buried from Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
“Their concerns were that... State institutions had made such a behaviour of eyes due to the "political corrective" oversensitivity against ethnic poetry and religion.
Sir Eric presented 50 recommendations to clean up the system, in particular to prohibit political activists to manipulate with the corresponding voice and to prevent the “reduction of voices”.
The report, which is currently valued by Theresa May, also requests more basic controls in registrations to prevent the use of optional lists for immigration subcutaneous and doses.
Consider the possibility of requesting the electors to present a document of identity before voting.
Using an insufficient incost on the fingers of persons in voting to prevent someone from choosing two times.
Exercise of the systematic controls of persons in order to ensure that they can choose.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting to limit for three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists to manipulate with reliable correspondent voices and electoral packagings.
Give the police authorisation to create around the election rooms of the cordon.
To change the laws to make it easier to cure persons developing illegal pressure under the reform law of 1983.
Interrupt photos in optional rooms.
Require that only the English (excluding Wales) work in election rooms.
Increasing education and ensuring that the workers keep the rule that electors walk individually in the election cabin.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says he is "exciting" that, after the case of Tower Hamlets, no accusation of criminal acts has been raised.
"The Court for election issues made Lutfur Rahman and his agent for Lithania corruption and illegal practices," he said.
From a number of people, it was considered the guilty of doubts - in the power of a proof of criminal offence.
It also criticizes the unexpected ‘control of the locked depth’ in the electric registration departments.
Sir Eric said: “The decision of the court in the case of awakening Tower Hamlets.
Our nation has a proud link to the Parliamentary Democracy colleague, but anxious and anxious extension of electoral submissions and the state of refusing to some authorities threaten this reputation.
Inflammation of the cyclist dual coach of Kate and other duplicates of known characteristics on olympy in Riu
The Olympics in Riu 2016 were deceived this week to the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, which is the most similar cycle from Cambria.
But the 14-year-old olympionist is not far from the only atletic athlete on gold, which can be encouraged by its own doubler from a number of known persons -- at least not by social networks.
To celebrate the Olympical Hers in Riu and all the known characteristics that are present on our screens, FEMAIL's women's column set up a list of olympics that are more remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a caught beast: The member of the American team of Brady Ellison (left) was compared to DiCapri
Near Kate's double on the cyclist road, a number of people online showed that a certain lueper could be a double of the stars of DiCapria.
The team of Brady Ellison's arms caused the storm on Twitter after his photos were drawn up, which ideally like the whale from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed medical crazy and admitted that he heard his similarity with Lee from a little bit.
"I don't see any great similarity except you," said Brady for Huffington Post.
"It's a guy and looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most important comparisons from London 2012 will be highlighted in the year without doubt more: the ideal figure between the British spring to Gregem Rutherford and the favorite hero Neil Patrick Harris.
About the Russian Gymnastic Aliye Mustafin with its great, distinct eyes, it was said that it was a copy of the Cuban-American song of Glorie Estefan.
And when we look at the floor basen, the South African ship Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for change: The user thinks that Nathan's "atletical version" herce from the movie Start (Inception)
The next year comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the herce Joshe Hartnett, who have similarly nice faces and mouths.
The Russian silver floor Yulia Efimovv is proud not only to eat the same feed and blonde hair as McCord. And about Nathan Adrian from the United States team, the fans say it looks like "the atletical version of Joseph Gordon Levitta".
Manufactured Women: Starball Hope Solová (left) and Dexter Jennifer Carpenter series (right) has a similar face and eyes
Not only one: The Twitter user was very happy that they observed similarities and the final
The theory: According to this container, there may be a similar view of couples
One Twitter girl recently expressed her pleasure on the pages that “the rest of the Internet think that Hope Solova and Jennifer Carpenter are in truth identical.”
Football star Hope Solova and dexter Jennifer Carpenter's series has an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Among other favorite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is exactly identical with the smile of Laura Linney's laughing, or the holder of golden medailles for Gabby Douglas's gimnasty, with her beautifully wide smile, which is like to copy the Gabrielle Union's smile, the stars of the Bravo film, girls!
The commentator of the Olympical Her CBC station is about the fact that about the Chinese floor said that "evolved"
CBC's divs of the Mediterranean Live Transfer from Olympical Hers at the CBC station encountered a resolution of the performance of the fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan's comment by Byron MacDonald. The floor ended on the fourth place of women's bathroom on 4x200 m staff with freedom
The Canadian CBC station was charged to apologize after one of its comments said that the fourteen-year-old Chinese vessel during the train was "coming as a smrad" and "exhausted".
The commentator Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was disabled when at the end of the final staff of a woman at 4x200 meters freely began to cut their own views.
MacDonald, who had to bring “life” in the CBC comment team, said, “The little fourteen years old from China, you stupid.”
Too much excitement, she got like a smard, she was exhausted.
Thank you.
The Chinese floor Ai Yanhan (14) played the second staff of the bathroom at 1:57.79 - so 1,61 seconds smaller than the Canadian Taylor Ruck and enabled the Canadians to reach China.
Wonders in Canada began to call online and were scared by the ton and language that the commenter used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "The voter on the CBC announced that the fourteen-year-old CBC vessel from China was "exhausted?"??
The idiot didn't notice that he was still in sending."
Ai Yanhan from China was described in a 4x200 meter-free warehouse of a woman's staff final, as: "The little 14-year-old China delivered it, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's criticism came on Twitter from all sides and many requested his revocation
When Twitter players learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn't keep up
The next girl, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like they were a band of racists.
Soon afterward, Scott Russell, who sent CBC, apologized for the living comment of MacDonald and said, "We're about a comment on the execution of a vessel that avoided sending."
It was a strange choice of words, I'm sorry that it happened."
The CBC station finally apologized more than 90 times for people who twittered in response to comment
Compulsor Scott Russel had to apologize by name MacDonald
CBC then copied and placed their excuses in response for more than 90 Twitter clients, who came to MacDonald's comments
The station also apologised and published the statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, she shouldn't get into the ether.
We've quickly apologized our whistlers in the sending and those who follow us on social networks.
In order to be fair, Byron's comments were related to the execution of a floor, not a floor alone.
Byron is deeply about what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in the living sending and tried to explain his comment by the claim that he did not want to be a personal attack.
"I'd like to apologize for the comment I introduced last night after a woman's staff," he said in sending from the olympide to the CBC station.
"I was thinking about the execution of a floor and not the person of a floor like that."
"I don't need to say that I wasn't going to have any uncleanness and hate me very much."
Customers in Primark deteriorated by a woman who, unfortunately, tried the underground in the trade
When a woman was pulled out to try a bullet on the salesboard at Primark, they were not purchasing certainty in which direction to look.
In order to be worse, she tried how her size falls, her knifes dressed and returned to the ruler.
She continued in the browsing and finally tried four bullets in the shopping center of Bouverie Place in Florakestone.
Business Primark in the Buyer Centre Bouverie Place in Folkestone, where a woman tried a cocktail before she returned to the regal
The mother of the two children of Jenny Davidson, who was at the time in the trade, noticed that a mysterious woman, after testing the underground, “he dressed again and went out of the business without buying anything. ”
She said, "The people could not believe in their own eyes."
She stood at the trading, took out of the cocktail rule, dressed her own boyfriends and cocktails and sat them up.
"They didn't even try to find a discrete place - just standing there, holding as a spice."
"Each one just looked at how the bullets were dressed again, and obviously they didn't like it because she returned to the ruler."
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, she dressed herself again and left.
"It seems that he doesn't worry who looks - nor would he think of the man who might buy a shot that she has tried."
After Davidson (33), who lives in Kentu, she said: “This idea that someone would take a house of a bullet that had any other, and no one has cleaned them. That's hot."
It happened on Wednesday afternoon.
After Davidson added: “When she went, I collected things that she obviously tried to stand out of the sale -- which is also the only right thing.”
"I'd be afraid I'd have to bring a new cocktail home and see that she had another woman on her own, dressed herself, and they weren't exhausted."
Primark's speaking business said: "Primark knows about the incident that occurred in our trade in Folkestone on Wednesday 9 August."
All the products concerned were downloaded from the sale.
How to prevent the attack of weapons using the Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com could be more safer for you.
We talked with Rhon Mizrachi, the Master Federation of K_Magy sitting in New York, and we tried to consult armed lumps at close distance.
This video will show you how suddenly to get over the violent one, whether he gets close to you, or back.
And when he approaches you back, he says to Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is to turn back to see your attacker and “the free way of shooting”.
Then capture the weapon between your faces and your arm closely before you put it into the face with a free lock.
Then he follows the knee into the weakness, and while the attacker is lighting in the pains, you turn his weapons from his hand, hit it mainly in the face and try to go, then you will keep the weapons on the side.
When a weaponsed man approaches you, it's a similar technology - get your body out of the flash line, take your weapons and stop it so that the donor can't shoot.
At the same time, put the weapon of strength and hit the attacker into the hole, then turn the weapon from his throat and take it down, continue to die.
Sounds it hard?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi is doing it.
But don't forget that the safeest way to get out of the crash - if you're not a master K’ Maga - is to give all the preparation.
Traveller Ian Wright olive the most spontaneous places in Europe to the roadshop
The British traveler decided to make a hard test of his immune system and a long reflection - the olivement of the most spontaneous and unfortunate places in Europe.
The Ian Wright's traveller and author (51), along with Suffolk, in order to demonstrate the strength of his immune system, he approximated his tongue of the Eurobank, switched on Piccadilly Circus, washing the toilet button and the Russian public phone.
Before approximating every subject, the meter used to show himself and to all of us in which it is going.
Experiment, on the basis of which the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was drawn interesting results.
The idea to slippe the flash button in the drag, which has used thousands of other people, can seem to be completely pushing, however, in the kitchen wood is much more damageous.
Ian Wright talked to doctors and health specialists during his whole road throughout Europe about strengthening the bacteria of heat flowers and its own health.
Unfortunately, nothing of what he licked on, he left nothing worse in his mouth than a wedding.
Ian Wright was celebrated by testing his deliverity on the roads around the world and eating wonderful and wonderful things.
During this mission, he completely tested his immune system - from the public disorders to the streaming states after spray
In the movie that said about it, “I have deceived my health from childhood, and I have given my mouth everything possible, from the bullet after eating red and bathed water.”
In the film, he confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused was the Spanish public bathrooms in Russia.
After a simple steel, he showed the value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, clean hands should have less than 60.
One public bathroom in Russia, but refused to slip after his meter showed more than 4000 units, while purely laid hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and the Finnish milk products manufacturers Valio surrounded the traveler's movie named The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the bathroom
In the movie he said, "This is almost the worst thing I ever felt on the bathroom."
There's nothing bigger than this!
I don't want to olive anything because it's unfortunate here.
Film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was enlarged in cooperation with the Finnish milk manufacturer of Valio.
Mr. Wright's company offered Valio Gefilus, which contains bacteria of milk acids and vitamins C and D, which help people to strengthen bacteria and immune systems.
Niko - Renmaa, an elder vicepresident of Valio for divorce, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer a new reality to the hosts.
Something that would follow the busy, and it would allow us to explain probiotic advantages.
We have invented a lot of foolish ideas that ended with the idea, "Let us call Ian."
It seems to be a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead, and we talked only about producers, we wanted to put them into larger relations -- good and bad bacteria in our daily life, the importance of the health of the soil and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy plants is the worldwide phenomenon, and we have brought more information to the users in a interesting way.
I also think it's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who was registering the film, adds: "Let's say that Ian would lose my respect if he had lost something of what I wanted after him - like perhaps the unfortunate Russian bathroom that appears in the movie."
It was naturally easier for Ian, and others very hard again.
I'm not that we have touched the oliveness of some of these spinners."
Valio conducted an investigation in 2015, where 84 percent of respondents associated the bacteria of milk acid primarily with the health of sugar and steel and 58 per cent of respondents, indicated that at least a possible use of products containing added milk acid bacteria.
The family of socially needed before moving has made a general building in the town of Saltash in Cornwall
The family of the social needs left in her general house damage at 50,000 pounds after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were moved out of the house in Saltash, Cornwall, in a long range of disputes against them.
After their violent exit from home, the officers of the home company were shocked when they discovered that inability is located in the Havarian state.
In the walls, the ground crytine was cut off, waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste and walls were shaded.
Family has already moved and has been able to live in a private apartment
Donna McEvoy, director of residence issues in Cornwall Housing, said she had anxiety of whether she was going to save the house.
She said: “For people here it was a nightmare, and I don’t think people should live like this.
It is necessary to consider a number of circumstances because this inability will probably enter into the community as “not so beautiful part” of Cornwal.
This family is unlovedly known and their names are unrealisticly known.
A couple of three sons who were living in the house sometimes, and the police said that the fear of the family was involved in the street battles with the use of baseball packs, the fear of the people around, the use of drugs, the distribution of drugs, and the voice crying, the hazards and the adjudications.
Skeldon (47), whose name was indicated on the payment with ↓, was sentenced for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms in the house that may be exhausted, waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste.
In the house from which drugs were distributed in the past, the ground critine was exhausted
Neighbors say they've seen them on the street, and people's regularly calling the police.
Cornwall Housing and her partner's violence moved out of the house this week after they got an additional period of 11 weeks to move volunteerly.
The neighbors who were rejoiced welcomed their lives to be a living hell.
One of them said, "They did not worry about anyone."
We lived near them 20 years, and it was like that.
As often we saw the police here, it can't be calculated at all.
"We couldn't sleep today."
We arose because there was an incredible silence -- we're not usual!
It'll be nice here when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a supervisory manager in the neighborhood of Cornwall Housing, noted that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
Family in the house lived 20 years, the police was regularly invited.
Waste and old games were replaced in the growing part of the home
He adds: “It is a conviction that the payment has not been able to take responsibility for her own behavior and her family behavior, and it is the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme, and their actions according to a witness had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team took, the police from Devon and Cornwal and the members of the local community who informed us well.
I hope that this step will bring a little pleasure to the neighbors and at the same time bring a message that we will tolerate unmarried behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the payment who lived in the house in different times were about 20 years.
Devastated matrace, left on the ground of one of the beds in the house
Workers will now have to remove the rocks of waste that remained stuck around the house
In 2014, police carried out more than 70 grams of canopy, weight, equipment and 1 700 pounds in preparation.
Skeldon received the repentance when she was denied for the carrying of drugs of class B that she wanted to sell.
She claimed that money was appointed on the basis of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in the car accident in 2013.
It seems that Tanya and her partner now live in a private apartment in Plymouth.

Turists in Portugal feared after low overflow of the military aircraft over the beach
Tourists who were exciting solar pairs in Portuguese Aveir were scared of death
The airport of the Portuguese military airport P-3C Orion passed to incrediblely low
The military aircraft announced that it was a regular year and that it was not to threaten security
At the time the low flight tissue arose over the full beach, she took a scared panic tourist.
On dramatic campaigns, it is to see how the military aircraft gets away from the sun to the people on the sandy beach in the city of Aveiro in North Portugal.
The tourists started to know after the sound of the engines of the tissue aircraft, without seeing what it's out of the darkness.
The incident occurred last afternoon at Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the recreators who published video records on social networks, said: “The flight passed twice low, and at one instant it seemed to grow. ”
Nuno Arroja adds: "I surfed, and I really thought that the plane would fall on my head."
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were scared when the flight flyed down from darkness
The Portuguese military aircraft today stated that the P-3C Orion airport pilot was on the regular plane to identify fishing vessels at the coast and had to be low because it was the only way to check the ships.
The airplane was evidently flying about something below than it is usually, because of the bad vision caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the aircraft continues to be threatened by the security of people.
Forest fires this year destroyed the part of Portugal's pee and requested four victims in life on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese military aircraft stated today that the pilot had to fly low because of a hot milk and smoke of fires that were prohibited in view of him
The airport was on a regular plane and the pilot was requested to identify the fishing ship in the training.
The half of the funeral services shall not comply with the rules.
The half of the suppliers of funeral services does not comply with the laws.
The Czech Trade Inspection (COL) has tried to check in the second quarter.
The funeral services according to it do not most often inform the rest of their prices or give not a written confirmation of the receipt of the claim.
CHO for this has stored 41 penalties in the total value of 1000 coron.
Today, she informed her speaker Jira Fröhlich about it.
Inspectors tested doubts at 47 of 95 controls.
In view of the uninformation of the prices and the lack of confirmation, some funeral services also sold products or provided services for other prices than they had been sold.
In five cases, the sales were not properly marked and once the seller used an officially uncertain medium.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products at a total of 7077 coron.
It seemed to be packed on urines, rubbers on lamps and weights that were not correctly marked by obligation information.
"Besides that this specific service continues to violate law, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," added Frühlich.
The London Schooler who joined the IS was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultan, one of the three British scholars who went away from London to join IS, died in Syria.
Representative Tasnime Akuniee said that the family learned about her death in the Syrian Racce a few weeks ago.
The ITV News announced on Thursday that it was probably killed during the Russian aircraft attack in Racce, which is a bathroom of a group in the country.
Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she was just dead at the time when she was prepared to flee from the war of the land and return to British.
"The man wants to believe that the only good to all this thing - as a message and a warning for the final that these are dangers associated with the way to the war zone - is that they will deliver people from when to make decisions," Akugnee said.
Sultana and two other students from the east part of London were moved to the aircraft to Turkey in February 2015 and then to the bus to the border with Syria.
Family Sultany learned that she was committed to the battle of the IS in Syria - and that she was deceived for a few months.
Reid says that if Clinton's chosen, he'll leave Garland as the candidate of the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Senate for the Democratic Side of Harry Reid says that he is convinced that the President's election candidate for the Democracy of Hillary Clinton is appointed by Judge Mery Garland to the highest court in the case of his election.
Republicians in Senate blocked Garland's name, even though President Barack Obama named her already in March.
The leader of the Senate Mitch McConnel says that the person who replaces the judge of the Supreme Court will choose the future president.
Reid announced on Thursday, during the conference talk, that Clinton would choose Garland “with a certain degree of confidence”.
Reida's speaker later said that he was not talking directly to Clinton about whether Garland would nominate, and that he was just speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "break the ship" by choice of someone else.
Garland is the president of the Federal Revocation Court in Washington.
Reid said that the republications blocking Garland's nomination are "servidors" and "shopping" of the Republican candidate to the President of Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't going to the office.
According to the magazine Treats, the calendars for "women and men" are found
The magazine Treats easily cooperates with the photographer David Bellemer to publish a calendar for 2017, inspired by the 70-year Pirelli calendar.
But instead of discovered known characteristics, they are trying to find another generation of top models for your calendar 2017 NU.
President Treats Steve Shaw has already told us this year that his magazine is full of stuck from Playboy from the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing it for women.
It's obvious that the calendar is also.
“We have to return to show the overtime and classic disappointments when women and men feel pleasantly and let them be inspired by women's photos of the body," Shaw stated in the printing statement to publish the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project, because it's a beautiful cushion of art.
Models can send their photos online or personally during the opened negotiations in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does the vinyl measure: who actually buys grammophone tables?
Vinyl loves single men in the middle.
Before you decide to pay the comment section by pepper notes under the pseudo-NeAllOsamilyUse the Mediterranean, we submit that this statement comes from the data-based.
According to YouGov, so much discovered grammophone tables are connected not to the tree of milenials who want to love the original property of the physical object, but with the nostalgic of the central.
Those who have recently buyed albums on vinyl are probably people in the 45 to 54 years of age.
Young people in 18-24 are at least likely.
In fact, it is not even about the shocking of a famous fan - all of it is emotional: older people who buy grammophone tables are probably trying to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are themselves (69% versus 66%).
But are YouG's outcomes true?
If this blog had been sent as a television report, the camera would follow me, as I looked out in the delicate street in Soho, dressed in decent red clothes and widely gesticulated. Then I stopped, stretched out my hands and said something authoritary, like: "So let's go look at it."
Let's go look at that.
While from the heart of Soho slowly extracting his charm and stone - buildings sometimes occupied by independent sales are now filled with hotels, restaurants and adequates, conferences and office needs - a number of fantastic specialized trades with grammophone tables have remained.
I'm probably asking the camera to stop pulling up for a minute, and I'm going to stand near different men in these businesses and try to see what their emotional and emotional divergence is.
Stuart (55), a parent from Glasgowa, whom I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three men of the medium) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight men of the center, one woman around 20) has a meeting afternoon in London and watches business to fill a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have some 3 or 4000 records.
All these records broke the walls of his inhabitants - on the picture up (foto sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles also has the possibility of allowing it: it can now buy grammophone tables that he could not allow when they rose up pêcally, and buy it again that he sold in the youth and had no wind.
"A lot of what I buy is from the end of the 60s and from the beginning of the 70s. These are things that would be issued when I was 11 or 12 then I was too small and could not arrange them," he says.
They agree that those who buy their records are probably intruding what they have in their own company and adds: “I don’t run, nor drink.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works in Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he met is in YouGov profile.
He also noted the new influence of people affected by the media vol. People who heard and felt forced to buy their old grammophone tables back.
According to my conversations, the people were the most often released from their collection between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their grammophone tables and bought a CD now sell their CDs to buy their grammophone tables back," he says.
That could explain the boom of grammophone boards of a certain grammophone.
But what is the evidence of the emotional importance of grammophone tables?
He will not take you more than a few seconds to find a pleasant community of people with similar thoughts in the business as Phonica.
According to Weze, some elderly customers are particularly deteriorated by the uncontact payment system.
Some grammophone board beneficiaries can feel payable in the digital world and decided for the known packaging of grammophone boards, things that result in peaceful growth.
"I think that filling the sea or property of something of a weight can bring a certain comfort," wez says.
I'm a collector, I'm here, and I think there's a lot of people too.
It's a easy way to fill the place in the head.
“We're all as their social work”, calls on a collaboration from a grammophone board homode.
In April, the ICM investigation discovered that at least 50% of people who bought vinyl albums in a month ago have not yet heard it.
According to the investigation, 41% of the grammophones who never use, while 7% of those who buy grammophone tables does not have grammophones.
At this point of report, he was probably seeming to be seriously concerned when he was running a gross boss compilation new.
The aspect of “trofey” and the survival of interest is something that Jonny observed (42), who works in Sounds of the Universe (start: three men of the Mediterranean).
"Now someone came and said, "I don't have a grammophone yet, but I want to buy the radiohead tables, and they could put it on the pool," he says.
The percent of these are not big, but it's going to be.
It's more about the product page than about music.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a grammophone."
They're younger people, not the elderly, growing pubertants, that's enough.
Fopp, where a whole pattern is currently replaced by grammophone tables, has a lot more different visits at my arrival.
There's a couple of seventy, tourists, who's doing that, pubertants and women in the middle.
While the atmosphere is not so released as trades earlier - from players instead of tahava jazz is the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of syntheses and sex, it is good to see different customers.
No one of them seems particularly single, but the inflammable soul of the trauma is hard to consider when you stand near someone 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) is spent a few minutes in Fopp and looks at different grammophone tables in the sleeve.
It's one of those who's looking at the explanations rather than to lose it warmly.
According to his words, she doesn't make it much, so it doesn't feel that the grammophone tables would collect.
It's worth a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on computers or similarly, but the grammophone tables have their cup...," it's uphilling.
I can't explain it -- it's unique.
My last delay is a trade that seems to have inspired a new generation of grammophone boards: Urban Outfitters.
I think I'm a very fascinating girl in the upset jungles and I'm following a group of native girls who just shoot around the Polaroid cameras. Then my father and her daughter decide to buy Crosley grammophone.
To the left is the stage where the wall covers Adele, Jeffa Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: mixing of current and classic music, based on any average grammophone table collection.
No one looks at them - maybe just because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't reach them.
It's purely "vinyl trick".
But because any attraction to him could mean more money for the sector and send a few customers to Soho's depth for another, it isn't much to do.
There is no surprise that demography, where it is probably more time and money than in the finals, is also where it is most lost for the most luxual goods which winyl is certainly.
But while, according to my discovery, YouGov's outcomes seem to be accurate - so at least in grammophone board trades, they do not take account of a large quantity of collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in facility, in grammophone boards and online fores.
These people probably work hard at schools or offices.
It is certainly not a quarter's turnover after trading with grammophone tables on Berwick Street, playing a record and avoiding a wonderful, thirty-year-old television moderate, which is hidden behind nothing unusual men of the center.

The Court in France refused to deploy trade in the Jungle cabinet
The Court in France refused the order of the offices in Calais to demolite tens of provisional trades and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of birds live.
During the proceedings of the Court of Justice in Calais this week, the State had to be able to cancel a total of 72 provisional trades where people in the camp sold goods, from cigarettes after energy drinks, offers hair safeguards, in provisional restaurants sales of tea for 50 cents or basic food for a number of euros.
The prefect office in Calais argued that places are necessary to be deteriorated because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay tax, and because they mean the danger of fuel and health risk.
The humanitarian organizations in the court indicated that trades and restaurants are vital and that foods that offer free of supported by State associations and other groups do not provide food additional for increased number of flights in the camp.
Difficult provisional trades and restaurants often provide free food for people in trouble.
The Court in Lille decided that there is no legal basis that would prohibit people to operate 72 provisional trades, but said that the prefect events of Calais are “very comprehensible”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the sales of food, coffee and restaurants have a lot more role than solving food to people who “live in extremely lost submissions”.
He said that spaces provide quiet places to meet flights and volunteers.
One of the places in which the democracy threatened was the café in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, which operates an invisible organization and offers 200 foods, hours of English and French and asylum advice for hundreds of threatened non-flying persons without delivery in the camp.
Five for the protection of the "child" coffee signed more than 170 000 people.
Guardian received a letter to which the closure of coffee “is a disaster for these children, some of them are only 8 years”.
The charitable organizations Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants considered on Friday that the number of flights in the camp has increased to more than 9 000 in the years, which is mostly the whole time.
You thought he was dead.
Ulch crosss himself and the voiceball ears.
"From March I could normally train," he reported at the beginning of the summer preparation in full power.
What happened to you?
I've had a surrounded pulmonary embolies, then because of the problems with the heart.
Because when I was at the University of Korea, I didn't know I had such blood problems.
So the distress caused long years to Asia?
I had two years in my throat, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, no one found me anything.
Then the throat got up.
In the boy, she's injured, she'll still be pained, especially when she's thrown or changes the weather.
But nothing that would limit me, more aestical thing.
Did you worry about life?
He had.
Last year, on the age tour in the woods, I didn't know I had an embolic, and I couldn't move there anymore.
I threw blood tonight.
Doctors told me that it was something fully different, I was still five days fully arranged.
I thought I was dead in the woods, as well as my girlfriend and family.
I've seen somewhere else.
How did you compare that?
I'm supposed to have to live, now it's just going up.
I know I have some blood problems that I have to watch more when I fly somewhere.
But he's going to do everything with that.
As soon as I wanted to get back to the Preparation of the Preparations, there were still problems with the heart.
It's all right now.
Since March, I've been constantly prepared at home to be able to play again.
I'm locking it, I'm physically better on it than before.
What are you expecting from Usty?
I'm glad that the party looks good, I know the lot of boys.
I'm aware of two other foreigners who will come.
I hope we're sitting humans so that we can do this.
Will you lift your ears up?
He had a story, but every season is different.
Brno two years ago was eight, now the second ended.
There's a new team in the Mund, just a few players left.
It was the last in the extralization, so there's a big space for improvement.
As we use him, it's on us.
We'll see the first rounds, who's going to be a bullet, we may not.
Is it a security of success, Brom?
He's already experienced, and he's living a lot, he'll think about better than the last place.
But my arrival was not dependent on him, I agreed before.
In the game there were other trainers, I was with one big friend, and it was agreed that it would work here.
It's a name to call me.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I'm not.
My big name, he was in good clubs, has trained a lot of years, is an ex-good player.
Move us up.
What are you bringing?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I'm not fighting, hecuing, and I'm getting a chance in a team not like this.
I've been two years in Prebrami, but it's more call than to be in the sixth team, because it's starting from the bottom.
You changed the foreigner, in Ush, he's already training Australian Boehm.
How's it looking?
I know him with the circumstances, we played against ourselves at the university in the group.
And a couple of times we've been talking together, sometimes we've been sitting together at night, so we're already familiar with our friends.
We killed them 3:1, soon as I started the summer preparation in Usty.
He's a Slovenian girlfriend, he's a friend.
The American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze will still arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote with the American, it looks like a nice boy, Brazilian who knows how to artist English.
Did you contact the American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so the one who creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I just discovered what it was for players, I found me on the Internet, playing, seeing a video.
He was all right, the boy of a bitch, he's high.
We wrote a couple of messages on Facebook, it seemed to be a whistleman, he'll come to us.
How do you rejoice in the recording unit position?
I didn't want to take anything else.
It's just 40, and I don't think I'm going to go.
I'm better in the center of the deal, I'd like to drive the team than someone else to drive him.
I'd probably don't want to play anymore if I should be a second player and get it up to the full time.
How many times were you the only one?
The half in the Prebram, when it brought Kust as a ́an, he hurt himself, and then there were problems with money, and he left.
Since that time, we stood up and I still played.
In the Brna, whom I was rejected, I stuck the one and the two.
The election year was in the Old City, after which I had a lot of offers, and I just chose the Pribram.
From there they wanted me, but I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new start.
Gold Number 22.
The short half remains Phelps' domain.
"To be again on gradual victories and to hear the himn is sweet as ́cky," laughed Phelps, and then he had the eyes full of tears again.
His grandmother and his mother re-covered in the look, the son of Boomer this time, quietly slept the hearers at the ears.
I'm going to live an infinite week to the end of the career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started flying a trailer and it's gonna be in a few hours after everything, he said too.
In the final after Phelps for two seconds, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino was left, who wined a half.
Bronz gained Chinese Wang Shun, bronze medalist in this discipline from the world's remote mastership.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (depth) is Michael Phelps a third sporter who controlled the same discipline on four games behind him.
After the end of the travel with Phelps, other American Ryan Lochte and Thiago Perreira were held in the head.
While the cup of gold in the final royal fifty centuries set up to a deep finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superheart will have at least one opportunity to expand its unique medal collections in Riu.
Shortly after the festival statement of the holiday, he passed to the rental final of 100 meters of the motil.
The Legend couldn't even shadow the country Ryan Murphy, who had received a double sign - after a hundred, he wined a double trace in Rio.
In the final, he left 37 cents of the Australian ship of Mitchell Larkin, the third Russian Jevgeni Rylov ended.
While Murphy has only the fifth place of the bicycle, he became a signatory king in Rio.
From the mental throne he seated Larkina, whose same dual place was just on the world's lower championate.
On the olympy, but he got the medal just now.
The Canadian Penny Olexiak and the American Simone Manuel were divided into the capital centuries.
For the sixteenth anniversary of Oleksiac, it was a fourth medal on these games, for Manuel's second after silver from the stafet.
The flood gold was obtained to OH as the first African woman in history.
I believe I can be inspired for the final.
This medail is for everyone who comes after me, sport becomes love for them, and they'll get there, where I am, said the famous Manuel.
Third, Sweden was Sarah Sjöström, who wins a bathroom of 100 meters of motills in the Rio, and still has silver from a royal hall.
After the sixth end of the world record of Australian Cate Campbell.
Japanese Rie Kanet won the Prisarian bicycle, for which it was the first olympical medal in the seventeen years.
There is no valuable duty nor of the world’s mastership, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Riu was obtained by Russia Julia Jefimovva, who, despite the beginning of games in the past, was defeated with the immortality of distress and competition.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won at the court and I don't know why I should still answer these questions.
I'm very tired of that, she said the Russian floor.
Just started in Riu until the special sports panel had a CAS arbitrage closely before the start of her.
They cared about my call and I won.
If anybody likes it or does not, or if he has another opinion to return to arbitrary court, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could win.
And starting at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs lived a special day.
They didn't know who he's going to be against.
They had to be able to get a tactic preparation.
And then, in the non-radical times, they started the bathroom on the small cort number 1.
By hundreds did not begin well, then they reached the shopping of a dispute, but at 19:19 they couldn't end.
In the second, they were better and compared, but the decision-break did not come out of them.
A number of services shown in the past represented the degree 10:15 and the swimming with the olympic tour.
"We could hurt the Russian," he lamented Hermann.
How would you evaluate the storage?
Hermann: After the funny start before I played, we got beautifully in the game.
At the end of my last balloon, he was flying the receipt that I used before.
We lost a hundred keys.
In the next sect, we put on them with a cross-overview, another defense, and we pressed on the service.
In the tie-break, there were a terrible disturbance, we dressed on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could hit the Russians.
Sweetheart: The damage of the beginning of the first sect, we ran out there.
We could download it, but we missed points.
The second hundred was great, and in the third, he decided the service.
We made a very mistake.
We gave them five points, and about the five, we had a lot of weight there.
It's damage because the Russians were playing.
How did you play at the small room number 1?
Sluca: Similar to China at the front courts.
The center and the atmosphere were different.
It was one hour a night, full silence, music wasn't playing, nothing.
That was the division of the center.
Such submines haven't chosen, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the bathroom when you found the name of an hour before the bathroom?
Hermann: She was special.
We started to work on the storage, without players, so we couldn't make a tactic preparation as for the final teams.
But Simon (nausch shot) accepted a tactic for almost all the opportunities that were there.
He had a lot of papers with tactics, so we were very well prepared on this page.
Do you remember that you'd ever start the midnight trailer?
Hermann: It's probably not.
We played half eleven, but not at twelve.
Ruski Birlov's block in front play-off to OH in Rio.
Beach volaibalists Markéta Slukova and Barbora Hermann in front of play-off to OH in Riu.
Was that inappropriate?
Sweet: As we played the last two storages in the group from ten, we had a regime moved before.
This was two more hours.
It's special, I can't imagine that another sport has a sporter who has to give his best performance in twelve hours.
But I think we've been prepared as well as we could.
We knew that it would be, but it's not typically, and it's probably a favorite time for playing.
How do you appreciate the olympical experience?
Hermann: Since the process was from our group's goal, it's on one side all right, good.
We got what we said.
But now I'm silent after the bathroom.
Slave: I'm going to sleep from it and I'll just take up on the Olympical tour since tomorrow.
The big brother's here, the first SIM is coming.
You won't disappear.
The new rules shall apply to all persons without the Thai pass, who will decide to set up a SIM of some local operators when they stay in Thailand.
So not only to tourists, but also to persons with visions that work in Thailand, for example, or have closed the marriage there.
The Secretary-General of the National Sending and Telecommunication Agency Takrn Tantasith informed that there are no exceptions.
The SIM sale plan designated exclusively to strangers represented the national telecommunication regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measures to enable the monitoring of their positions are to be taken by the Authority within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is about safeguarding national security that will enable the criminal action of foreigners.
Furthermore, those called tourist SIMs have aid to discover persons who exceed the allowed duration of residence.
In the case of sellers, there should also be a special SIM for foreigners from the side of the SIM designated exclusively to Thai.
The differences will be just a follow-up, which will be permanently enabled at the card of persons designated without Thai pass.
It's not possible to disable it.
"Tatoe is not at the SIM for Thailand because we can easily follow you," added Tantasith.
It is necessary to add that there are no anonymous payments in Thailand as in Czech.
The seller requires a certificate of identity.
On the other hand, one of the operators sold freely SIM tourists in airports.
They were so anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand considers ten telecommunication regulators from other Asian countries, such as Malaysia and Singapore.
The SIM registration is also applicable at present, however the legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
However, the remaining measures do not mean the obligation for the foreigner to be organized on the entry into the SIM country of a local operator.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in such a case, Thai authorities will be short.
The operators of the country shall know only relevant network information after the border of the SIM login to their network.
So they know the phone number, but never the information about the owner.
However, the division of the roaming prices rather than the taxes of local operators is so furious that even the tourists in their lives in Thailand will begin to watch local SIMs.
The role of offices to monitor the movement of foreigners was legally expected by foreigners in Thailand.
Tantasith acknowledges and compares the obligation to provide resident addresses in immigration documents in relation to privacy protection.
Police will also need a judicial order in the case of the need to follow individuals.
Any misuse of the system will threaten closer to the undetermined punishment.
"If the service provider is to follow the SIM position without a judicial order, he will be accused of an offence," added Tantasith.
Moreover, the system should maximize and use prepayed cards.
While currently the recycling of a specific number until the expiry of the 90-day period after which the SIM has not been notified to the network, it may be possible to renew the number after 15 days in the case of Thailand leave.
The Luxury apartment in the new building of Vinohrades has a basement and a terace cluster.
Why did you choose a apartment in the new building?
We've been looking for an unprecedented apartment where there is an old manager who cares for the immobility.
The underminking was enough for parking places and rents in the house, which was basically dealing with an older campaign.
Don't talk about the problematic accumulation in old houses, the problem with hazard grounds, the high energy ability and the same.
The submin was also big terases, which the old battle could not be offered.
Other interesting visits will be found in the modern apartment magazine.
The entire interior for you has made the Lenka Langer with her colleague Kamilo Poláco from Artiga study.
Why did you just devote them?
Would you recommend cooperation with a professional to everyone?
Co-operation with the expertise has recommended everyone, if he is in the apartment from the beginning, a very complex technology process.
The second level is the design of the internal: designers have a substantially better idea of the scale of possible materials and on the basis of the customer's desire, they are able to sweat the internal properly.
With the Lenka Langer, we have already cooperated in our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a customer's personal recommendation, and because everything worked well, it was a choice for us to rebuild our new apartment in Vinohradach.
What were your practical and esthical demands?
We wanted a great community-resident space with a corresponding territory for a four-member family captured as a modern, but not a cold internal.
The priority was to achieve the association of the habitat with therapies and to carry out intelligent home control.
And, of course, it was necessary to watch the quality of performance.
Did you leave everything on the experts, or have you entered into the final form of the internal?
We have approved all advice of technical designs and material samples, but we have taken from the points.
At the beginning, we figured out what we expect from design, and showed some of the elements of the internal elements that were locked into us, such as coppers or images.
I think our assembly, mostly, of the Czech authors, including Karla Malicha, Karla Wysušila, Václava Šühly or Otto Gutfreund, helped us orientate in our funeral.
The combination of black, white and ocean tree was also a idea of the same as the individual cups of accommodation, walls, grounds, lighting, coppers, textiles, arts, etc. That, whether all the ships are ships, we have verified together by visualization.
Did it occur when you performed a complication that caused you to give up your ideas or to reach a new?
I hope only in the introductory phase of the project, when we arrived to build at the moment when the first time it was possible to get up to the height of our ground, and they found that the views we planned were shadow of the environmental building.
Then we changed the letters throughout the night from the foundation.
The kitchen line was also used for the wall of the wall.
Inside, they have overcome the tree surfaces of added skin, for example for the eating of the Norm of Arpere's eating and barbary sheets.
How would you characterize the internal?
Do you want any changes here, or is there something you would like to have different today?
I think it's a modern air-interior that is mainly filling his own.
We don't get changes, the range of adaptations after moving has been played in the shadow and acquiring teras.
Hopefully the only outcome is to the ground when the ocean tree shows us too cold in the house with the dog.
The word text, Ing. arch. Lenka Langer and MgA. Kamila Hornych, authors of performance.
The living is in the last stage of the new building, thus it was possible to implement a completely new available solution and a number of further adjustments.
For the internal is the important element of the position of lightwaters in the street of driving and the main toilet.
That's what we got a daylight in the darkest room of the apartment.
The direct entrance from the main bathroom to the front terrace to the basin from USSPA is also one of the building adjustments that was very beneficial for the whole apartment.
The part is also a basen and a crowd.
In comparison with France, you are not negative, says the Muslim living in Prague.
You're coming from France.
Where did you live everywhere before you moved to Prague?
My parents are an Algeria.
I was born in South France, a bit of Spanish borders.
I've moved too much.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied a journalist in France and then got to work in one magazine.
So why have you decided to leave the land?
I started feeling my soul in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mostly because of the atmosphere among people.
I found that every French is very negative.
People in France are generally negative charges, but it has been worse in the last time.
It's interesting that you're just mentioning negativism.
Some people value such a Czech respect.
Trust me, you're not negative in comparison with France.
Some people may not come as soon as they come to France, because they don't think it as a tourist.
But it was too much for me.
A big topic is needed for money.
People feel that they have a little money, while the minimum payment in France is 15 hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Moreover, there's a problem with the behavior of people against the Muslims.
That's totally incomprehensible for me.
For example, in the street in which I lived, my unmuslim neighbor began to look at me through my fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'd be a bad thing.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you just choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work anywhere else, and I reached a free place at Air France here in Prague.
I admit that I didn't know Prague from the beginning.
I've done something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me what happened in Czech Republic, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years and I'm not gonna imagine I wouldn't stay here.
Was it a big depth when you moved from France to Prague?
Mostly because of the entirely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's not talking Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or admissions, but I feel people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress me, and no one can judge me.
In France, someone still looks unfairly at you, perhaps if you have special clothes and similarly.
I started to feel real free in Prague.
They don't care about such things as I think.
Where are you working now?
After employment in Air France, I worked for one way web.
Then, with one friend, we found the websites on which people offer and seek shared residences.
We are acting only in Prague, but they wanted to expand it to the whole Central Europe.
Do you have Czech friends in Prague?
I've got two very close friends here that are Czech from half, and two more Czech friends.
I have to say that the next specification of the Czech is that it's going to keep it up at the beginning.
They won't leave someone to the body soon.
That's the whole distance of the place where I grew up.
Everyone on the south swimming and swimming in the face.
Here's another thing, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you weren't talking Czech.
Is there a language barrier for you?
On the contrary, I have it pretty easy in Prague, because everyone's talking English here.
Even in dinners or foods.
I'd like to learn chess, but I don't have so much time.
And when everyone brings a little communication in English, I don't need this language to learn.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who's gonna help me.
Did you even meet the negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a muslim?
In fact not.
Maybe it is also working in a international employment that is more tolerant.
One experience attacks me.
My leader, Czech, once told me about the French Balls team and spoke something in the meaning: 'for they're not French but African.
That touched me pretty much.
But somebody's gonna have a problem with being a muslim, that's still happening to me.
And even though the colleague warned me once for such anti-muslim demonstrations.
He said I shouldn't go to the center they'll give me there.
The antimuslim demonstration is partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the presentation affect you?
Maybe something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen even in Prague?
I feel safe in the Prague.
But the problem is, it can happen anywhere today.
I couldn't imagine that something like this would happen in France for a long time.
And it's not just Muslims.
Moreover, Islam doesn't recognize the violence.
For me people who kill, they're not muslims.
The Coran says man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you not do when terrorists protect your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel bad and guilty, even if I don't have to feel like that.
I'm trying not to follow these reports of violence, but every time I read something, I need to talk about something that really is not my fault.
I'm fully different, so why should I be terrorist?
We met in Jiri from Podebrad.
In the middle of the Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that people feel needed to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty of something they didn't do?
Do you meet in Prague with other muslims?
For example, my cooperation is from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious detention than me, so sometimes we have a very wild debate about islam because we all have it a little different.
I'm coming from France, so I've gone through another education, they may have learned the islam to school.
We have distant access, but we respect each other.
People in Islam sometimes are connected to a woman's underlying position.
How are you doing?
I don't think I'm in any case.
More like that.
I'm a woman, I have power.
It also relates to you that you don't have any head covering.
For example, hidjab?
And it is signed mainly in the way I was educated.
My mother, for example, is a fundamental muslim.
He's praying five times a day, but he's not wearing.
She always taught me that the faith is a clean personal thing.
It depends on everyone's interpretation.
If a man reads the Koran, he should make his own view of those things.
So when I read in the Koran a passport that says that God said to the prophet to hide his wives before the eyes of the last, I said, 'I am not a prophet's wife, so why should I hide me?'
On the other hand, I respect it, and if I have to come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the bottles require, I'll take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
Still yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I thought about Poland for a while, but I'm fine in Prague.
I'll even imagine that I'd grow my own kids here.
The pool is a ideal city for that.
The Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated violence.
The wind of the Kozelsca Fenclo in Riu was thrown to the procedures.
Friday leaders on the sea in the Brazilian Riu de Janiero went out of the Czech Emperor Veronice Kozelische Fenclové.
In Laser Radial class, she moved before the final two districts to the tenth place.
That would make the Czech insight in the final box.
You're collecting packets as paquets.
They're trying to buy the transporters.
For the idea of using already planned routes to carry out the carrier, the TV recorder Mateja Liška and the manager of the Prague Music Club Marek Greger.
With the idea they inspired the life of three people with a distant geographical achievement.
We sent the National Transfer in May.
At this point there are thousands of cities in it, and we will expand the network.
In Czechland, we want to learn this first than we're looking forward to the shop, he says in a conversation for iDNES.cz equality-year-old manager.
How does Transfer work, and who can benefit from it?
You're getting it and you're registering freely.
Then you can specify the road and data how large the package you will be able to overcome and how much you want for it.
Someone asks for transport on that day again.
When the road and the holiday goes, it's burning, and both of them comes mutual notifications.
The chat will be opened in the moment where two of them will agree with transmissions.
How many people would be supposed to register each package to find his curriculum?
I don't know the perfect state, I can't consider the number of registered and the number of roads needed to be completely optimal and each offer was dealing with the request.
It's already working on the main stairs, and it's logically easier than perhaps on the road between the villages.
More people, more potential of accuracy and accuracy.
People also build up their trust and find out that no one's running with the package.
You haven't had to solve that case yet?
How many guys have the service after two months from the startup?
Currently, we have about 5 to 6 thousand people who create roads.
We think it's success and we believe they'll be packed.
Isn't it dangerous that the sender is waiting for it?
We hope that we will be competition for large conglomerates just because we will be able to give the same day and the price break.
You'll pay for a big company in two hours.
Here you're going to pay a hundred even less, because it's the way someone's already undertaken.
Should traditional transporters be afraid of the potential department of customers?
We hope that will be.
The market has a huge potential, it is feeded here by great transnational transporters, as well as the trade strings, where all started to buy, and have progressively found that quality does not correspond to what they pay for.
Nobody wants to find a letter in the clipboard with a message that he has an entry to get up to the wallet, first the day after the 19th hour.
At that time, I needed a package for six hours and I waited home because it was important.
We want a better, better and employment service that does not celebrate anyone and send a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matthew Liška (39).
No one ever acted in the collection of information.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matey Liška as a TV recorder.
In 2014, they began to prepare a Shippancee ↓D, which is used to transport packaging packages already planned roads between the world metropoles, especially the airport.
In 2015, they provided a project for the processing of a company that created a need for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programme was last three quarters of the year, and they introduced the market in March 2016.
Transfer applications started developing in the past year and issued this year in May.
This is the local version of Shippancee adapted for the Czech market.
The applications of the Messik and the Messik Profi developed since January and accessed to the participants at the end of July 2016.
The purpose was from the beginning to do all these  firs that are connected to one day.
In Czechland, they want to join and then, in collaboration with a strong investor, to improve the world market.
The shared economy is at the last time a subject and this is the service of the type AirBnB or Ubera.
Don't you worry about the action in Âa, which no one can even say too much where the border of sharing is and where the green economy is?
It's the same, just another product.
It is clear that if it's successful and we're going up with it, we'll be the next move in the eye through the green economy.
But although somebody makes it, it is not intended to hold financial authorities and tax controls.
Each holder, on the one hand or on the other side, will be invited to grant his income if he makes it.
What do you think the service has such a great potential?
The sender is swimming and the carrier makes it, respectively reduces its costs on the road.
It's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
At the time of the social networks that people share, they wanted to draw this closer.
They can produce nice stories, people have the joy of helping someone and to tell them about it.
Maybe someone brings you forgotten bribes, keys or pulses.
People have missed personal access for a longer time, and we say this is the service of people.
So how do you make sure that the kitchen doesn't break the package?
Each holder with registration shall record a civil proof and shall provide a bank of connection, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give service to the service and to the human.
The curriers also collect stars based on the evaluation of the senders.
We'll offer insurance, we're still shiping details.
For an uncertain charge in the case of loss or damage, the curriculum shall be handed, but does not accept the responsibility for the contents of the criminal law if there is something inside and does not know about it.
The police will stop him and find him in the closed packet in his cart of self-palm or 10 kg of hashish, the criminal responsibility of the sender.
Doesn't it threaten the use of sensitive data from the database?
In the case of the need of a supervisory administration authority, which will have the only opportunity to see it, and we are not able to see it ourselves, data are protected against misuse.
How many money will get after successful delivery of a carrier in the hand?
The curriculum determines the price and gets the whole amount he's talking about.
The sender shall be taught a few percent further for contacting.
These money are our wins, but it's just a few percent, because we want to press the volume.
The curriculum can also be charged by no one to add the charge when he delivered it in the absence, taking and delivery is assessed using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
What about the size or size of the package?
Well, you can do anything.
We've got three sizes, a little like a coat of oil, a middle like a egg's plato, and a big like a base beer.
Then there's no more restrictions, and if anybody has a place in the car, he's going to be transferred by a league.
Plus the sender has the possibility to photograph a package, so the curieur sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack if you don't want to hide the content.
You're shooting a missile in your hand, and it's it.
Who came with an idea, and how did the ministry continue to run?
A friend got a idea more than two years ago, then I didn't give much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo with a supernational reach, which is mainly targeted for a traveling aircraft.
At that moment, I told him I'm going to look for a investor, but I'd like to stay in myself and give up that.
The next year was developed before we found the Shippancee firm in Londres because of the greater creditability of the whole product.
But this is not the version you're focusing on.
No, the marketing went to Czechland where we tried to get out, because it had all birth pain and it was still what to resolve and improve.
We are trying to react to the back link from the clients and the market on the market on the moment we do not solve so much.
We know that it's a run on a trace, but we're not taking it, we want to create a good product for people.
Shippancee ÂD was the basic and the best, the other two were their way of upgrade.
Transfers occurred when we said that the national segment could be far more interesting and we at least learned in Czechland.
The third of the Messike is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address and to the second end of the world.
It works for the senders as well as the Transfer, but the division is that you see in it as a curiure in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in the mobile.
Applications for curriers who want to live there, we called the Messik Profi.
So somebody can make it exhausted by getting a pack out of the city?
Exactly, the latest is getting to Prague for a taximan, a student, a mother to a parent's allowance, someone who wants to get the way to work.
Like all of them are stupid now, so they can collect this totally the same.
The man sees where the town's orders, comes to it, clicks and sees when it must be assigned and transfers the ship.
It's set up more leather than competitive services.
At this moment, we're doing a web interface that will be able to send businesses, to fill data on them on the web, or to create points on the map.
Then we will be able to use their service for each month.
Are you going to make the project a full account now?
It triggers us, but we usually have it in employment, and they could enjoy and develop the project.
We don't hide a strong overnational investor, we're two boys, one of whom had a genial idea and the other in it with other undertakings and ideas.
Now we are looking for the investor quite strong enough to be able to cook with us not the Czech market, but that should go with us to the world product and become another great market player such as AirBnB and Uber.
The historic part of Titanfall 2 has to bring a forgotten pest.
This is the second part and only the game in it will be based on the first information more pepper than in the Call of Duty.
The length will be moved about eight hours and the full will be exhausted just from the capture of a network in the first part.
It is therefore possible to rejoice in the freedom of movement, which includes the possibility of use of war titans other than running.
Furthermore, the game will include the levels related just to the rotation movement.
They're going to join the boards and include rebuses.
Their conviction is therefore a basic example of two steps, walking through the wall and the lanch.
Sometimes, it will also be necessary to eliminate the enemies.
There will be no maps with a bleeding and a level with special concepts.
In one example, it may also be possible to switch the border and close the powerful door.
So you'll be the shape of the battle.
The time of the game should be accommodated between the diarrhoea action and the quietest moments for the examination of the unknown planet.
We're gonna play for Jack Cooper's bed, I'll make a pilot career.
Cooper at the beginning of the campaign, together with Lastimos, is growing on the foreign planet Typehon, both enemy soldiers.
And it's not a dark beauty to him.
In addition, the lastimosa at the hawair is a deadlife, and Cooper will be assigned to carry out Titan's titan.
His dream about the pilot's career is so fulfilled before he expected.
By step, but it will be necessary to steal the battery for robots.
Cooper's talks with Titan will also be significant.
The players serve as a source of information about the military past, but the individual robot communication will result in humor moments.
For example, when the titan is going to dry up all the hurt that threatens Cooper at the planned excitement.
With information about the campaign in Titanfall 2, he brought the Polygon server.
Moreover, the outcome will be possible to review in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first outcome from the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 appears on October 28, which is for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ mark is alive, but the editionality remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes the name of THQ Nordic.
After the THQ issued in 2013, it obtained a series of its labels and the right to use the log and the name of the company.
Nordic thanks to this, for example, Darxiders 2 Deathnitive Edition or Package Red Faction Collection.
Furthermore, there are 23 other hers for publishing, and 13 of them have not yet been discovered.
Thirty years ago, when I went to the rent, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found our neighbor in 20 years of younger man, our neighbor.
I've made it from the beginning -- first of all, she'd probably tried longer, and then they'd gone into the rocks.
It's a big guy, like her type, because she walked with a similar one before me.
She's totally crazy.
In those first days, she even changed her voice, she had such a girl, loved voice.
But when I told her I know what's going on, she stopped.
But I've been watching it all over.
Then he walked regularly from work to half fourth, and so she left three to purchase.
She tried to see him at least every day.
After I've come to see they're getting in the barack, in the rock.
How many times I said they were right there.
I cared about the keys, he was determined to accept them there.
But I don't know why, finally, I've been sitting home.
I couldn't go there, to make that step.
Maybe you'll smell me, but I believe that my wife has controlled me.
Soon she thought I was unable to do what she wants.
And I did it.
Maybe I'm just a bitch.
Instead, the neighbors indicated to me that he also knew about it.
I was so stupid that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it'd be so bad, so it'd be bad.
That in the family it's going to take everyone, something just a daughter's mind.
So I've dismissed it, go on.
But once I went after him to the apartment, I needed something to help.
He went with me and I told him I got anonymous to meet my wife, and she witnessed all that.
I asked him what he would tell me about it.
He stood there, cried his arms, looked into the land, and didn't say a word.
Then, at that time, I met his wife on a traveling journey.
I told her, but she didn't believe it.
No one responded to it, and she didn't tell me anything.
No one told me anything then.
I'm a man who never walked too much, who has a problem to meet someone, so finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I've still seen that it's gonna end one day.
I said I'd forgive it all and life's going on.
But it wasn't.
And I've never seen all of this.
I have it in my own tonight.
I've been eating a lot of times before, but I've finally left it for calm.
He's still living in the neighborhood and I'm still living with her.
It's just better than my wife to my master.
He's done everything at the house. He's doing everything. It's the woods, the woods, the rocks.
She's working.
I think she always tried to do something else.
And it's gonna be said she's even good.
But sometimes I'd like to see her, cover her, and she doesn't leave herself.
We go together to travel and buy, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she ever told me she never loved me.
That she had me, and she had me, but she didn't love me.
And I see that he loves him to this day, it's her god.
And I don't have such a life.
When it started and I took it very wrong, I told her one time I didn't want to live and I asked what she would say to it if I finished it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her, yes or no.
But she thought and finally said, "But there's enough place."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to create a new French islamic hope that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
After terrorist attacks, France graduates the fight against radical islamists and helps the calling government and the local muslim minority.
"When the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate the public freedom, it will be more difficult for France to ensure freedom of recognition," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He decides to ensure that only the spirit of education in France is preached in the country.
It also wants to stop the financing of mixtures from the rental when the preachers often join the jajads with money.
In October, Prime Minister Valls wants to create a new French islamic hope that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
The new institution will replace the current French hope for islams, which in 2005 was founded by the former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
She had already contributed to the transparency of financial flows between mixtures and countries that fund their building.
Soon, however, the internal divorce was cut off, and she never worked hardly.
"It's a complete failure," stated Valls.
In the head of the new mandate, apparently, the former Minister of the Inside and Defense of Jean-Pierre Chevenement, known as a staff of the secondary state.
In France, approximately 2500 mixtures and prayers, about 120 of them serve radical islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities from the country have removed approximately 80 islamian spirituals and have considered this step in several other decades.
This week, the German police also committed against the jahadistick spirit.
The Imâms were given to the battle of the Islamic State.
One of them was operating a space where the spectaculars seemed to be radicalized and later attacked on the Sichem temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate in France on a new institution replaced by the non-essential opinion.
All other terrorist attacks succeeded in the name of the Islamic State.
The new mandate will have two main tasks - to ensure financing of mixing from home resources and to monitor the property.
But there is not yet where it gets the finance, although it is considered a few of them.
One of them is a special payment for food challenge, which is, in particular, for the meat that is buried from damage in accordance with the Islamic principles.
This tax would be paid by the sellers in practice for food chain, and it would be for granting authorisation.
Then part of the money would just travel to the budget of the budget.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French beneficiaries who are released to Mekka.
Each year, they are in the traditional field to Saudi Arabia, and they are out of France about 30 thousand.
Furthermore, in French mixtures, only the publishers who have passed educational programmes at dark universities should be implemented.
Their preaching should therefore be in accordance with democracy.
The government also closes radical mixtures.
"We've closed them twenty and they're going to follow," said the Minister inside Bernard Cazeneve.
"In France there is no place for those who report hate and do not respect our country's principles, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His former wife hardly hurt an unknown shooter on Friday afternoon in the purchasing center in North Spanish Zaragoz, writes the Index.
The shot happened after a woman and a daughter left the garage rooms in their car.
The man was waiting in the car before the purchasing center, from where he also started to shoot.
According to the witnesses, the man turned the gun against himself, writes Indian.
She brought her to the hospital a non-injured daughter, for men in a critical state, she had to get a sanitation.
It was about 11.00 in the central metropole of Aragonia’s autonomous, near local university.
With a revocation to the Spanish Agency Europe Press, India writes that the motive was probably an unrecent divorce of both partners.
We wake up with a cross, we wake up with a row, a cup, and a chi's coat.
This year wants a light, well-feedable eating, because we are the Czech Republics and we have our cup and our head.
And then from the summer garden, the grilled hair, the bowl, the wheel.
Not too healthy, not too easy, yet so sometimes except salat or coated greenine.
True, grilling is susceptible for time and vessels, and it is also a community matter, and no one needs to be closed in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives, how to make good understandings, which special chairs, their preparation represents a small ritual, but there is no longer to produce, pet, smooth or soul.
And they contribute to our health.
Whatever it needs to be a home sushi or sashimi, where quality materials and a couple of well-obtained griffs will be enough for preparation to be a pleasure and food for a real exotic hole.
Like even easier roles in the rise paper of today's reception.
This is even more timely driving and collapsing rises.
The paper is just allowed to get into water for a moment and then it is only dependent on the fantasy of the kitchen, how it decides to play with fulls and supplements.
It's not like a cow.
The results of a number of foods in Asia's kitchen today are also that sugars are actually currently available.
Increasingly packed sweet oxide cotton, which is one of the basic sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the right round gary has a single piant island, and, at the same time, a lack of milk grateful recepture, which is mixed from some species of octave and scarlet.
It is therefore enough to buy a sack that corresponds to the size, and the attachment with demonstrable antibacteria, which supports irritation and distortion against cattle or wheat, is ready.
Banan lists.
In particular, it is used in Buddhist and Hinduist cultures in serving and removing food in the most different holiday opportunities and rituals.
The long-coated papers of banano are very extended in a number of countries of Asia or South America as a "help" for the preparation of the most variety of coated, coated and remoted foods, which are packed in them as the alabab.
The banan sheet then provides a specific food advantage.
We can buy in sales with exotic fruit and green, even in front of the bars.
However, select only the blades of the green network, and then healthy - not disabled and without a curvate.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salat from a race of wakema, sesame and sesame oil.
It's the same thing to buy the frozen again.
Whoever often goes or prepares sushi, it is likely to know about the race of nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of the sea, from which it is produced by sushing, lising and drying of the newspapers called Nori - so the payments intended right to produce sushi.
Wakame − dark green race growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido − it is also fresh and dry and is equally ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≥ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤  = ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤  = ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤
In addition, whoever doesn't know the wake-up missing, the Asian women are probably using it for abortion after birth.
And at all, this race is very wonderful.
Clean blood, strengthening blood, even severely prohibiting hair wheat and literally buyed by mineral substances.
The dry and diluted wakame also serves as roots, for example to protect the rise.
The pure rows are first allowed to swim in the water, then they are swimming, putting into the female water, and half a minute driving.
Then they are cold in the ice water, the middle seeds are cut off and continue to be adjusted, perhaps as a favorite salat.
But to buy it already, yellow, it's the easier solution.
The role is, therefore, only left with easily green filled, slow and easy, full of healthy feelings.
That's a bomb forever.
You're stuck and you're not going to adjust a grilled bottle anymore.
Eat healthy, easy and summer.
The Asians know how to do that.
It's enough for a couple of special sugars and a bit of thickness, and you have interesting fresh food that slowly combines swimming.
And it's finished once two.
Four cups of rose paper, 40 g mrkve, 40 g white row, 100 g green cross, 60 g salat boxes, 60 g rows of wakame and 60 g sweet chi cups.
Heavy coriander, black sesame bed, chi-shirts beds, 20 g manga, and 40 g of a laying gari of the cup, a little pini boxes.
First, we'll prepare the boxes.
The rise paper is five seconds in the cold water.
Then we'll take it out and wait until it gets tired.
Meanwhile, in the warm water, we will quickly wipe out Christian exhausts, about three minutes, we will let them be cold into the ice water so that they will not lose the color.
On the authorised paper, we'll put a full of greenine and packaging.
We'll completely prepare from white lines, marrows and salat boxes, which we're packing on the white rows, we'll smile them with sweet chi's cut, add the broken coriander, we're just mixing and putting on the rose paper.
We're putting in the banana sheets, adding the bullets, and finally adding the whole food, we're going to have a variety of wakams, contained by a manga plaque, we'll get a black seam, and add a couple of pini ornaments.
British must be satisfied with silver in the seventh rugby, Fidži's choice takes gold
The successful execution of the Great Britain in the seventh ragby ended with a devastating rate on the latest disturbance, Fiji struck in the final camp on Thursday evening British at the Deidoro stadion here in Riu at 43:7.
The Fidgeans have preached mysterious lessons in the processing, sticks, movements, support games, running to the lake and brutal forces - and have received gold, their first olympical medal at all.
The rape came with an unseened price of comfort in the form of silver medaile - for British third day - and the British could be on their performance in the inhibiting olympical turning of the seventh ragby fierce, hit the New Zealand, Argentina and the South Afghanistan.
The swimming winning over the South African 7:5 in the semifinale the same day, may have been frozen in the final.
Of course, Fidži would also hurt a 15-member team in its form.
In fact, for British, they're comforting, but they can be glad that at least one of them will have a golden medail tomorrow: the main pitch of the Fidjans is Ben Ryan, the former leader of England in Wimbledon.
Great Britain has hit the road cousin.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's management, they lost every stock in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This injury is painful, but the progress is increasing.
Fidji started a big degree, the British defenses reflected for joy.
For Tom Mitchell and the rest of the players it was like running for a number of buses in the movement and the world's campaigns were driven 5:0, when Osea Kolinisau broke outside the corner.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added further down on the right wheel, from which the conversion was.
12:0 and British is hard to touch the meat.
Excellent Mitchel tried to stop the great Leon Nakaraw and prevent him from scratching the third, but only Fidjan was quiet.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua touched the right corner and the Brits lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added the next time he returned, and for hours there remained more than 1 minute... from the first half.
Then Vatemo Rawa passed through the small British and got to the hall where he scratched.
After the conversion to status 29:0, a break followed.
It was like Fidži was born for ragby 7s, while the Brits continued to be translated.
That's exactly what it is.
The Brits have made hot changes and the oppression of the Fidjans have stopped... for a long time of four minutes, which was good in comparison with the first half-time until the brilliant middle of Fiji Joshua Tuis went on.
Dan Norton tried to get the opportunity for the British, threw touchdown to the left corner to increase in 36:7. But a long time they won the people of the Pacific Islands and their fans sing on the halls, sing with flags and dancing.
It was hard not to surprise the completely joyful access of Fidjans.
At the final moments, Mata Viliame was still insulted by another trial of Fidjan's winning.
The writer answered, the Fidjans were stuck and the Brits fell on the track of the whole destruction.
Before the same day Fiji in semifiral hit Japan 20:5 and the Great Britain entrusted the Republic of the South Afghanistan in a deep semifinal - to the division of one conversion.
Kyle Brown received the South Africans first half time to lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his armed work, broke the defense line and cut the second half time under the shock.
The great late stick of Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother from the 15th team of England, enhanced victory - and finally also silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning's victory in the magazine train inspired the battle of a trainer with cancer
You won't find more emotional gold on these Games, and that's what to say.
From the first summary to the last, during the 220 penalties to the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another importance at their golden moment at Stacio de Lagoa.
Even when they were sitting at the festival, there were three voices in the ship. When the ship was shooting after the level to meet the second olympical gold behind her in the bathroom of two women, the voice of the trainer Robin Williams was still present with them. They are the first women in the history of the British sports who have reached such a result.
Their prejudice was absolute, generally their 39th train, where they remained unbelievable.
What we see - two exciting atlets, as the water level flys with elastic labs - does not reflect the poor victory.
After every golden medal of the cow is batalion of helping hands, which a bit after the bathroom means division. And no hands were more helpful than the trainer's hands who didn't know if it would happen this day when he was found cancer.
According to his words, it was uncertain.
I suffered the cancer of a potassium that can be operated, and I've been doing this operation.
Without operation, anything could happen.
It would be very bad.
Sometimes it changes your view of the thing.
Cancer was detected to Williams in 2013.
The joy for the whole trio was that he could stop the treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside myself, and reduce the accident to the minimum - if we can call it in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to give myself the docromades.
It was to get up.
I was in the hospital and I walked after the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said a few steps are enough.
That's how it started.
It's a way to make it, but this was something more urgent.
Without all the victory, their first thoughts about Williams, who was very nervous, spoke less than usually how he tried to overcome his own calm.
Stanning, a man of the king's workshop, who has a mission behind her in Aghanisthan, said: "This week I was with emotions on the bottom, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
It emphasizes again how much it means for me how much we worked with Helen and Robin too.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin until now.
Without Robin, they weren't anybody, so he belongs to his great thanks, he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't want a better man for training, nor a better kid.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost the only train in five years.
Two of them had a horrible rythm that their rivals couldn't be equipped.
Even in the final 500 meters when the stocks from New Zealand and Denmark began to be closed, Stanning with Glover had a very large reserve.
We've focused at the moment.
Helen cried, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to leave in.
We had a good start, and we didn't try to reach anything else.
We didn't enjoy today's fire, but we just wanted to get good inquired, go out and win the bathroom that happened to us.
Two will take a year to think before they decide what's going on.
Glover's in the next week, it's the TV of Steva Backshall.
Now he wants to cut up the moment.
I didn't want to say that's my last train.
That would mean too big pressure.
It was about six months in London before they found that I was a olympical champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
This was about four minutes.
I have a lot better feeling," she said.

Prison?
Rather than carrying people freely, the taximan Rubes says to break-up accusations.
Six taxi officers and the former officer of the magistrate in Prague are, as she said, complaints.
You have enhanced a number of reports in which you have discovered subcutaneous practices and those who have to be in a group that will occur before the court.
You've been reading for some inappropriate matches with discovered actors.
How is the report on the complaint of members of the organizational group interrupted?
I was waiting for the court to come.
I'm primarily aware of the judgment.
I don't think they should be in the procedure.
That's nothing.
First, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them so they'll drive all people freely.
It's sometimes an insensitive solution.
So it means that you don't have a casual penalty as sufficient?
It's enough for me that some of them are so scared that they're not doing this job anymore.
For example, one makes pingles, another considers the pizz, and one is completely able to do it.
Theory can get two to eight years of age.
Do you think that's a suitable rate?
I generally have a problem with freedom.
I think it's bad.
Closing someone in the course, especially in such a case, is unconscious.
Such people should return to the company they took.
Thus, the fourth century was that the name of our land was destroyed and the people just stolen.
So let's do a good visit now, and let people look free.
I can't imagine it else.
It would work as publicly successful work.
As somebody's going to collect a waste, they'd get a car, and they'd be able to carry people after Prague.
No, I really think they'll finally get a submin and they'll be worried.
They'll find another way to undergo somewhere.
He studied at the Film Academy Miroslav Ondrić in Piska and then at the University of Tomás Bati in Zlina.
It belongs to people who started in the Czech Republic with viral videos and videos directly for the web.
It works as a editor for the Internet TV Stream.cz, where it is shared in a series of orders, now prepares the Prague Guide order, which is designed primarily by the spectators.
The Rubes, in the form of short reporters, advises what services in Prague should be avoided and what it recommends without concern to use.
Earlier a series of names how to do this, City of undergrounds?, Life in luxus, A enough! and Praha vs. money.
Unfortunately, they are talking about the organized group.
The police followed her for a few months.
Can such a underwater taxi network be marked by mafia?
They're such nice mafians, not as we know from Kmotra.
It's more about mafians - June, but organizers are sure.
It's just that they're watching the staffs each other.
The powder's totally disturbed.
I investigated that, for example, the main instructions have no part with Paris, Paris has no more in the case of taxiers waiting at Karl Lázní (disco club)
Everyone just watchs his place and each group is organized.
It's obviously a complicated network.
But the accused are only seven people, six taxiers, and one ex official of the magistrate who warned the driver against controls.
As you say, the unexpected ones haven't disappeared from the street.
So what percent of the Prague undertakers in the tax service is your estimate?
It's a very small percent.
The worst ones are still on the street.
For example, I'm talking about Alesh Ryack.
It's a man that is dangerous -- in his car, he drives a telescope cotton, and every Friday and Saturday stands at Karl's pool and carries people.
When I finally went with him, he wanted to follow me seven hundred in three miles.
His cops didn't keep it out of the way.
They only chose a few people from the whole large group.
However, the same is in other places of Prague.
Thus, seven people will have difficulty to remove a fashioned praises, which, of course, has much more dimensions.
Of course it's nothing.
It's gonna help, but all the evil doesn't move, it's true.
Are taxiers who steal the tourists still in the same places you showed in reports, so at Karl's pool or in Paris's street?
Yeah, exactly.
In these places, each day, and every day they break the statements.
He's ignoring it as the city police, as well as the Prague magistrate.
It's not even cocourks anymore, but totally awesome.
Business of Prague Taxis in numbers
However, some of them, whether it is a part of the group, will get before the court.
It's a middle.
So I have to ask me, do you feel enough learning?
If I'd take it as a suffixion, it would be wrong because it was my goal, it's gonna be and it'll be to improve the centre of Prague.
And even if I feel that it's gonna be a little better, I'll continue to do it.
You need to press the door on the other side.
Even when the last evil remains there, they still had to do something for it, and they removed it.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But it's not that, it's, of course, more.
Are you trying to cope with them directly in taxi?
Sometimes I'm doing the tests and I have to say it's still bad.
I just got a taximan outside the same group last week, and he was very surprised that he saw me again.
He had 560 crowns in three miles, although he then claimed that it was 56 crowns (used a trick with a decimal piece).
He's got to do that, the cops arrived, and this taximan was so disturbed that he was still following those cops and asked them when someone finally gave him the 56 crowns.
Similar case.
The taxametra taxaker overlooked the decimal piece and stole tourists with 357 crowns.
Did you say that the lowwater taxiers' stealing did not stop even after you showed the faces of those who had an insensitive amount after a short driving?
Their endurance is still incredible.
How did this work with the 56 coroners in the householder?
The cops sent him away with that they couldn't talk to him at the place because he had a tenant.
And that will be, I think, a problem in the court, and six taxickers and one exhaust.
On the one hand, there's a taxi officer with his tenants, on the other hand of the police.
In accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice, the judge shall not use secret records from the service taxation vehicle as a evidence in the court.
When I broke parts of their undergrounds, the taxiers themselves warned me about this precedens.
I wanted to use the records, but I just wanted to use the report.
Are you afraid that this ability could protect it from the court?
I hope every judge will understand that no taxier could drive six or ten crowns per kilometre because he wouldn't live.
You talked about a trick with a decimal piece, which, in particular, before the poster clients, subhydrated taxickers are stuck.
Is it still current, or is it worried that this fig after your reports have been published to continue using?
I think we've arised this trick by sending up the order, in contrast.
Recently I went with a taximan, he praised me that he was the honest taximan.
But then I noticed that the taxamer's side of the black lep.
When I asked him what he had, he said, "You know what it is."
When the taxiers were not too busy, could they be cautiously influenced by the court with their colleagues?
Is there something that can be able to deal with the fools?
You've been talking about the way you think they're going to find the crazy.
I think it can't do anything.
But someone can get out of those places.
And these are the fair taxiers who should work more to get them out of there seriously.
From my experience, I have to say that these fair taxiers in Prague are overcome lucky.
But do they have the pleasure to go against those who call their services?
It's good, but they're missing mind.
He can't walk too much in it, and he can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized this demonstration (from us to a comprehensive restriction to the funeral of the Adrian Krnačov Primator office), they did not recognize what they actually wanted.
Once they said that they did not protest against Uber, that they just wanted to have the same submissions as that service, and then they said that they wanted more than Uber.
It happened just that they locked the Prague and there was only the best possible advertising for Uber.
How do you generally appreciate the access of the Prague magistrate in the solution of the problem with the pre-prejudice?
It's seeing that she had to go into it until the criminal police had to solve something.
The magician was short to it.
They had a box that made information there means that the taxi division had done his job for a few years totally inconsistently.
I hope that the officer's teaching the final controls of all the dead controls to know what he has done.
That's the worst thing to me.
I've even been with him on one control driver, which I've tried to get out of their description.
The last parts of the series have been published for several months.
What's the answer?
I mean mainly for the spectacles, in fact, that's the most affected series.
When I've got friends from the square here, I'll let the video go to them.
And then, when we go to the ancient village, there's surprise that the same people who see on the halls are seriously standing there.
Unhealthy praitic celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd put a floor around them so people look at them.
Communism Museum right on the street.
My last question is.
You're taking a taxi when you're going?
Sure.
I'm running with services that I don't have to pay for, but a card.
I'm using services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of subcutaneous.
But there's a lot of disappointments that are fair.
I just took a taxi on the street since that time.
The leader said, "Yes, you have a courage."
Well, I'm in the overcast for the Italian tourist.
Taxi practices were written in 2005.
Sometimes the primator Paul Bem went out on the same year on the control driving in the overdressing for the Italian tourist and immediately on the first trial, the driver broke it for two hundreds.
The Rubes editor had worse experience.
The taxis officers taught him for a carrier from the ancient city to Václava, 820 crowns, which comes about 195 coroners per kilometre, as the reporters calculated.
Instead, the Prague magistrate set the maximum price for 28 coroners per kilometre.
In the surrounded reports, there are also further surprising sums: for example, a two - meter road from the street Paris to Truhlaria's tourist 400 corners.
The dear boss also offered taxiers waiting at Karlov's bridge.
For the driving to the angel, which has 2.5 km, they may have six hundred crowns.
Mramor's mixed by pure water, the most without chemicals and the more longer, better.
Uncleanness from it is good, although sometimes the spine has to be put down by the scalpel, it is necessary to remove it from the moods.
It's not easy and it can't be, it's closed to his job, Vanes Trost's restaurant from Oldrich's in Hajj.
Bottom down before it: the sepulchre is obscured by a cure, which must be thrown in a number of times and again the following.
"The restorator should be careful, patient and irregular for work," she found.
It's not far from her first restaurant work at Fridland.
Thanks to her, for example, the rock elements of the fasads in the back tract of the Friedland Council were expected to restore the sockets of Santa Maria Magdalena in Zatiša, the Holy Jane Nepomuck in Fridland, Pieta in the Freeland Circle Street, the Marian Column in Fridland or the Atlantes in the front of the laze in the New City.
With the refund of Melchior, Christopher and Catherine from Rederna, they began in 2011.
Now the surface of stone elements is cleaned from the throat of uncleanness and cross, which is released from stone parts shall be thrown against the fall and move; or they shall be thrown into the wall or to each other.
It is also waiting for treatment and surface preservation.
The signature on the burst will be re-flighted.
"Therefore, the referencer of the State Memorial Care of the City Office in Fridlant Very of Saturday stated: "Therefore it is to be thrown in the marmor boards with platte gold," said the referendum of the State Memorial Care of the City Office in Fridlant Very of Sabbat.
In the past, there are no records of the fact that the recompense would pass through such arrangements.
In a closer view, the opening in the marmor columns will be opened.
They're hundreds of years old, and it's about the rest of the dead.
He was richly excited, unfortunately after the trip of Sweden during the Thirty-year-old war, everything disappeared.
The term of the sepulchre was sealed, noted the Sabbath.
In the Church Finding the Holy Cross, restaurants with a mild-speaked as a house.
After a vacation in 2010, there was a need to get into the order of the sepulchre that felt under water, restored baptizers, wedding males in the grave and now the sepulchre.
"They're glad too in the future, too," she told the Sabbath.
The church is different in a very good condition, each year in the maintenance and we put money in.
Areator work on the renewal of the regeneration will come to 128 thousand crowns.
They will be cut off from the contributions, the city in this part of the renewal will put in any of their money.
Hundred thousand crowns will just come from winning in the national competition round of the History City in 2015, then 28 thousand crowns are the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, declared the elder of Frydlant Dan Ramzer.
Representatives decided to release the winning for the restaurant of the burst.
Experts' views on the future development on the selected markets on the markets followed by index and comparison with the Czech market (PX) in a month and a half of the year.
On the markets, it overcomes low callatilite and growth.
Who would say that at the beginning of the year.
The American S&P500 index, which has passed 12% of the correction in February, is today at the new history maximum and has already been added to 7% from the beginning of the year.
This is the reaffirmation of the railway rule that trademakers should never face the interests of the central banks, which finally have reached their own.
In the event when the American action on the historical maximum is renewed to the mixing of callatility, which is currently less than 2014, when the markets grew satisfied and without fear, thanks to the quantitative release of the American Central Bank and when it was steadfastly under 12 per cent as today's volatility index (VIX).
And not too.
Although the Fed of the markets continues to be prepared for gradually increased rates, the quantity release in Europe and Japan is in full run, and the last week the Bank of England has also added to work, which will buy debts in the next six months of 70 billion.
Thus, the new quantity release wave presses so low income and contributes to the total elimination of risks and fears of the future.
How will this state be sustained?
That's, of course, a question for a million.
In view of the monitoring, however, there are no risks, the world economy is increasingly a constant growth without constant expenses, the commodity market and China is stabilised and breathed in general, so they may not be too surprised if the American action continues in a similar quiet regime.
I'm sorry Juncker's not studying Klause!
I'm very aware that my friend Michael Barnier has taken this important and important task.
I wanted for this benefit of the work of the experienced policy, the leader of the European Commission Juncker, when the French policy (truely tried, because it was so different by the most different overnational policies that the best example of the European Elite, etc., was hardly searched) was appointed by the main negotiator of the European Commission of Great Britain.
Juncker's choice has shown signs that the EU is seriously interested in seeking with British form of friendly coexistence.
However, the British media adopted the name of Barnier as Juncker's military act.
Barnier is a European federalist's scale.
Great Britain hates.
As the Euro Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014) he was concerned with the reform of the European Banking Rights.
He took her as he could only catch her: the closed enemy of the English capture of the free market and the model of capitalism.
The station of multilateral regulations was jointly the concept of the Bank of the Union, and it is aware of everything that comes from the London Financial Centre of City, which has decreased the legislation for the violation of strong financial regulations and services.
So this Michel Barnier, a representative of Paris in contrast with London, will be a strong, improper and obviously an invisible negotiator.
That's not a good news.
How not remember in this context the calm and friendly division of the Czech Republic, which has so much contributed to the promotion, overview and ability of the Prime Minister Václava Klause.
Even so today, the Czech Slovaks can be the closest friends and associates.
It's damn that Juncker from Václava Klause - at least in this - hasn't learned.
It would be good for everyone!
Landscape around Putina?
The governor of Kremla lost his nearby Ivanov.
The Russian president Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov on Friday from the office of the Chairman of the president.
It's his place to take Anton Vayno.
She informed the Russian media about it with a revocation to the Kremlu print service notice.
But Putin pointed out that Ivan was released on his own request.
At the meeting that was transferred by the Rossia 24 TV station, the president said that Ivanov's desire to be expressed at the arrival to that he wanted to be the leader of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
He also announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for environment and transport.
The report on the exchange in front of the President's administration, which now will bring Ivano's relevant representative Vajno, is considered relatively surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is also marked as one of the closest cooperation of Putina.
For example, this former KGB officer in the past remained the Defence Minister and the president of the Government.
Now they will leave the chair of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov, at the meeting with Putin, said that the long stay in the head of the administration of the State is actually a recordman.
He held in her four years and eight months.
In this regard, he reminded that in 25 years of its establishment, 11 people had already been concentrated in this respect.
The kvits or debrists of Uncles are not playing the fineal of the Chaffar.
Not one of the tennis injuries could even be changed into finality.
As the first of his battle, Peter Kvit, who followed the Portuguese surprise of Monica Puig after the seeds 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
The Czech Debrists also followed the Quater after a minute.
Even though Williams' sisters in the first sect were shocked after the fucking, however, two setballs were lost, and the Russians finally used hundreds in a decreased game.
The two hundred then lost at 4:6.
Semi-success in the afternoon program in Riu ́menalo of the Czech Republic: Skifair André Synek wins his semifinal when the second Damira Martina from Croatia was hit by the release in the conclusion for a second.
Today, the undermines were great, the wind was calm.
I've been trying to watch as much as possible, the Synek's.
It's his opposers to the division they had to fight.
So they're dressed by the powers, that could be easier tomorrow.
But I don't say it's gonna be easy, it's just playing in my cart, the Prague Dukly's magician.
I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm not going to go in the Snyck Betters.
The fifty-five-year-old monastery was in the semi-final today in its fourth position, and on Saturday, she was waiting for starting in B final and fighting at 7 to 12 places.
Londen's gold isn't worth it.
I didn't pass on the olympia first to the final.
It hates me a little bit, but on the other hand, I've been eating a quality truck and I've given everything that happened.
The supports were just better, the Topink Button was thrown before them.
She was fighting up to the end and believed that her fourth games between the elite six would be reached.
The battle was delivered too closely before the goal.
I knew the girls were equipped that anybody from that field could go.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could get to the final through the Rakushank.
Unfortunately, today, it was a life travel, she said to the mystery of the world of 2011.
Nepechal, a young shooter Philip Nepechal, who had not even been able to spend out of the ≥ ≥ this time in the bed.
There he was not in the 33th place.
The best qualification came out to the Russians.
From the first point, Sergej Kamenskij had 629 points, from the second Cyril Grigorian (628,9).
Nepechal's insult had a value of 620.5 point.
For the first time, the athletes, including the Czech Seven-Boyers, were talked to the program in Riu, Catherine Cach and Elisk Klučin.
Cachs belong to the second discipline of the olympical competition on the eleventh place, the Czech recordman Elisk Klučina is twenty.
The British Cathrina Johnson-Thompson, who sprang to the height of 198 metres as the second of Nafissatu Thiomova.
Both were concerned about historical the best highest performance of the seventh.
They tried to hopp 201 meters, but they did not.
German, Russia, who's worse?
When we look at the absurdity of the question: The German company has passed through the deep seberflexy, where neither Russian.
In both the Great Eurasian nations, dictators were presented in the 20th century, and the power of the regimes which were non-idic, brutal and terrified.
The Russian Bolshevics have contributed greatly to 94 million of communism victims, which indicate the Black Book to Communism, whether it is a daily individual repression, targeted by hunger, incompatible war or non-idic experiments.
The Nazis have destroyed about 6 million Jews in a way, and the total victims of the Second World War I consider 60 million.
The Germans and the Soviets had the confidence in the surrounded or abandoned territory.
In Germany and SSSR, only a few individuals were guilty, but most of these crimes were already actively, passively or only by swimming the head into the sand.
It's not the specificity of these nations, we're Czech likewise guilty.
In Germany, the deficiency came in the court of Norimber without the end of the war.
The most important, however, has come to the position.
When the children were growing up, they began to ask, ‘ Daddy, my grandson, why did you make such animals?
How could you do it?
This brought a reflection and the treatment of the company.
German elitis have recently looked forward to the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the blessing of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naturally idealistic) objectives, but they are definitely not able to join it back to Alsasko-Lotrinska or to someone - to revanch - military attack - maybe everyone recognizes it.
After the lost cold war in Russia, no big reflection came.
The window of potential positive changes has definitively been closed on a break of thousands of years when the former KGB (sic!)Vladimir Putin has reached power.
The criminal past is often celebrated in Russia today.
Russia's roadway is a revanch, the gain of lost territory, the reduction of the West.
Health, prosperity and the future of their own people is not a value for the relief.
They'll be afraid of their own, and the strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that this is only the decades of the depot regime that the Russians are not genetic or culturally reduced - predicted to the Asian (self) Tyrania.
Who's the growth of the pressure around Krim?
Ukrainian Army.
In the last days and hours, the deterioration of the Ukrainian-Russian border in Crema has occurred.
Who's the growth of pressure?
After a longer period of relative calm, the relations between Ukraine and Russia returned to further deterioration.
The part of the Ukrainian side became a half-room of Chrym, which was connected to Russia more than two years ago and was part of its territory.
The reports from both endeavored parties, of course, are contrary and are difficult to verify them independently, and so we have only the opportunity to think about an oldly known question to who it is?
According to the reports from Moscow, the terrorist attacks on Creme from the Ukraine side, which, of course, rejects Ukraine and accuses Kreml from the operation.
The information on the arrest of Ukrainian special units in the territory of Russia has already come from the case of Savchenk's pilot's famous response that they were evidently removed in Russia's territory.
They approached the Ukrainian version, in which Russia would contribute to deterioration around Cyprus?
A simple answer sounds: in nothing.
The scaling pressure around Krim can only damage Russia, mainly from the West, in the form of further sanctions and strengthening the Anti-Russian campaign.
In the past year, immigration crisis to Europe has occurred to take attention to Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost a total credit from its residents when the current support of the President of Porozhenka is moved about 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have been bankrotated for a long time to not be the EU's and mainly MMF's economic injections.
In this context, the Ukrainian regime will react to its country so that he will make his further requests for financial assistance and try to improve the renomousness of the electors in his country.
President Porošenko and other members of the leadership of forces are willing to be shown again as strong men who are afraid to build themselves too to the Great Russia.
It is no longer hope that all those who try to resolve the distorted conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their great responsibility for life, not only soldiers, but all the usual people on both disappointed parties, and will stop their enemy action at times.

The United States secret services followed Russian hacker attacks a year ago.
The information on Russian attacks was received to the public last month when the Federal Research Authority (FBI) announced that it was an attack on the servers of the Democratic Centre.
However, no official reports are mentioned about the Russian share of an attack.
The Moscow part of the attack was cut off.
The report on the monitoring of a given Russian attack was extremely secret because its expression would show that the American secret services monitored hacker attack and could also be discovered how they do it and what resources it uses.
Two Russian reporting services were likely participated in attacks.
New Cyber Safety Advisory Committee
The Russian track monitoring material was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, wrote Reʹs.
Only a small group of eight main jobs of the Congress was informed from public factors, called band eight in the United States.
It is created by the Boss of Mitch McCon and Paul Ryan, the president of the Democrats in both Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and the four members of the Congress Security and Security Committees.
The Officer of the Democratic Party Donna Brazile on Thursday announced that it was to create a Cybernological Security Advisory College to "defense future attacks and ensuring the first classic protection of the Democratic Party servers".
In Albert's loss, he was a dangerous parasite.
He's excused.
On the basis of the undertaking of the health career after the consumption of the food Losos wild beared - 100 g cups, date of delay 22⁄2016, the praised hygiene control carried out in the sales of Albert on the Vaclav Place and on the Mount.
The inspection concluded that the L23012562/T4 cargo with the date of the date of delay 22日2016, on which the customer warned no longer available, and therefore the product of the same layer was rejected with the date of delay 11.12.2016.
The laboratory investigation confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It's the parasite red of the trailing tract of the marine wheat.
It is dangerous for a man - larves in the body dust or the smoke of fish are a strong allergic, and a man's upset living larves can go through the wall of the wall into the internal organs, said Shtich.
We are very concerned about the customers for the problems of this marking product.
We straightened the following burden from the sale and all the other layers of this item from the prevention.
There was a doubt on the side of the supplier we negotiated, and at the same time we left this product testing ourselves, the Newvinkan speaker Albert Barbor Vanko said.
Since the customer purchased this product, he can return it in any of the trading lines and get the money back.
Larves destroy the frog and sufficient warm adjustment
The seller was Nekton-Varnata.
The hygiene production of a dangerous product has been informed by the Prague and Mediterranean veterinary administration.
According to a server of safety food.ch, people after the delay of the parasite can disease anaxiosis, which is manifested by the pain of breast-feeding, returning and injury, or the disease can run without sign, introduced by the CTC.
Symptoms are obtained for a hour to two weeks after consumption inadequately processed infected fish.
After three weeks from the beginning of larva disease, they will spontaneously leave the use tract.
Adults and larves are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, so they are killed either in sufficient heavy processing of fish meat or in frozen.
The veterinarians have currently checked the loss to the beneficiary of the imported goods in the Mediterranean country.
Three of the five tested samples had a parasite.
The sale of 1700 products came into the RC under the national veterinary administration (SVS) on the beginning of April.
It was expedited, in total to the Ahold string, until today, 919 packages.
Currently, the download of the unselling resources of the product from the sale, said the SVS Petr Pejchal speaker on Friday.
Immediately after finding positive samples, veterinarians prohibited the sending of other products accordingly.
Seventeen-year-old British wanted to get out of Rakka, obviously killed her a Russian nail.
After the beginning of the invasion and the absence of a jahadista that was killed, the exhibition came.
The expected chalifate changed into hell on earth for British girls.
The girl was in contact with her sister Halimo.
She repeatedly phoned her to British and believed she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to get out of Alcatraz.
They have a command to shoot without thinking, quoted by the Telegraph of the family lawyer of Tasnima Akuniee's deceased girl.
The last tracks were led to Rakka, and the girl's been calling back from there.
Then there's only a report about her death, but it can't be verified.
The family communicated with her from the apartment in East London.
They jointly examined how she could get from Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
They hoped to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she was able to flee, because the house in which she stayed compared to the country's shot in May, introduced the British ITV News.
The television added that the bomb apparently had a Russian aircraft that attacked the IS garden in Syria.
You would have brought the blue from heaven only to get your child from the dangerous, said Tasnim Akugnee, a lawyer of the family.
On the week when (Kadiza) thought about the fleeting from the country of the Islamic State, one of the Rakushanites was arrested and, according to the available information, was publicly killed to die.
I think (Kadiza) expressed it as a warning and decided to ignore, according to BBC Akugnee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and 15-year-old friends from Shamimou Begum and Amira Abas were released on the road of 17 February of the year.
They just said they were going out at home.
But they moved to the Gatwick airport and from Turkey to the controlled IS territory.
The girl's family according to a lawyer did everything that was in her power to get Kadisu back.
You would bring blue from heaven only to get your child out of danger and this family has done everything she could to drink all the strength to get her daughter home.
But it couldn't be without the risk that they were captured, he added a lawyer.
The only positive according to it is that the Court of Cadizy can serve as a fearing case for other girls or even boys who are allowed to be disappointed by the Islamic propaganda.
"There are many cases when people were released there, they realized how the things were there, they realized how far it was different from the promises of the propaganda of the Islamic State, and they wanted to return," he stated next.
The Council's Council's judgment is not known.
Since they were still silent, their families have to be satisfied with the greatest probability of the dead.
For money.
In Scotland, you can go to the network, even without breathing of crime.
For many centuries, Inveraray was a national center and a carrier from Argyll.
Since the half of the 18th century, the courts were executed and the summer under the court served as a local service.
The mixtures in which the containers lived were sad, and many of them tried to escape.
Some of them have succeeded.
That is why the citizens decided to move the areas to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848, and it was much more favorable to the clergy, had heating and gas lighting.
So it was not in the operation, its conclusion had occurred from economic interests already on the end of August 1889, since the smaller rectification equipment were costed to operate and was not too payable.
The stories of the contemporary and the hole of the spirits.
For the public, the community has been informed about the entire century of the post, visitors can compare the old building with the new to convince themselves how different submissions in them were held.
The springs in hours are still strengthened.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can find out what forms of criminal offences have been applied, whether or not, to swallow your fingers or to burn the marks on the body.
In the views, tourists may be allowed to close into one of the targets, mostly because of a photograph of memory, or to indicate the feeling that they live outside the networks.
Nevertheless, the Inveraray is one of the most famous Scotch sites where it seems to be worse.
There have been a number of groups of paranormal activity hunters, and the museum even allows people to come to capture such spirits.
That night, however, will be 300 pounds, which is about 9500 crowns.
A foreigner, other than this arithmetic tourist attraction, is also a great food, a surrounding panorama and a story.
"Anime" effect on Snapchat is criticized as asiatic career
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired inanimaly, but some observers say that it is racially insensitive.
Application Snapchat allows approximately 150 million people to change reality and to play with the identity of the ways that they have with absurdity.
You can make ananas, dogs, or statues, that is like it's got out of the image of Roy Lichtenstein.
The filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfishes every day.
Any mistakes will be published immediately.
Snapchat filters have in the past served a critical with accusation that it promotes blackfacing or that it supports white shadows as a ideal of beauty.
So when he offered this week a filter, which caused the slight eyes, the dead teeth and the inflammated faces, some critics signed it as the racial Asian karicature - "yellowface".
And they asked whether these repeated issues would not indicate the problem of the company -- a divergence problem.
In the middle of the Verge and Motherboard, the news and inflammation spread and Snapchat immediately stated that he had cancelled.
The company offered an explanation: the filter was intended as a manifestation of the animal positions, not as the career of the Asians.
But to observers who were witnesses of racism, the filter recommended painful stereotypes in the action.
Others without pack comparison with animal refuses.
Grace Sparapani, a American art student from Korea, whose twot on photos was largely shared, said in the e-mail that the filter was “almost damage and trap.”
She added that “there is difficult to argument against comparing the evidence of Asian career and the effects of the filter.
It is shown that the filter is not only on the yellowface (yellowface), but the yellow face is attached to an extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company who has crossed these cultural borders.
It seems that the American culture in itself has an unnecessary divergence and including, from the town meetings in Hollywood corporations and equipment that we all wear in our hands.
And a great quantity of young people in Snapchat - which are more racial diversification than their elderly partners - can mean that we can expect more sensitivity.
"When a Snapchat filter creates a picture that is vulnerable for a certain person," said 25 Katie Zhua on Thursday in the conversation, "one very hard is to do these things today without notice, as it was before."
Katie Zhuova, the product manager and the media worker, decided to delete her to Snapchat on Thursday and invited the final to do the same.
In the article for Medium and in the telephone discussion, she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflect the lack of diversity in the workshops in Snapchat.
Katie Zhua criticized overwhelmed white, completely men's leadership and the article hash to: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's like that there is no divergence between employees and colored people at the moment when he decides about these things," Zhua, who has Chinese-American pÃ¦, "or there are only people working, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasing to speak."
Other observers share her opinion - the complaint Snapchat left in significant way without answer.
The company shall not publish numbers relating to the diversity of its employees by having the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the race of his employees, but, according to the speaking company, recently adopted a workshop, which should focus on the inadequate population and the internal management.
Zhua adds: “I am aware of whether other such persons really are able to say that it is not right, ” by being rejected.
Army experts have drawn reporting information on IS, says the Parliamentary Committee
The Parliamentary Committee, issued on Thursday, stated that the rapporteur's reports from the United States' Central Commander changed the reports of the reporting service to make a more optimistic image of the war against the Iraq State in Iraq and Syria than the events of the country.
According to the preliminary report of the group established by the President of the Republican Power Committee, the Committee for Reporting Services and the Defence Subcommittee, the "ground insatisfactory" was found between the analysis of the Central Rapporteur Services, according to which they had changed their assessment of the American efforts to defeat the State of Islam.
The Central Commandership, known as CentCom, is a military center in Campa, Florida, watching American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The print report states: “The outcome of the reporting secret services approved by the Centcom supervisors have usually offered a more positive image of the U.S. anti-terrorist efforts than confirmed by the country's entities and were constantly more positive than the analysis obtained from other parts of the reporting community.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when an error analysis is submitted to the overseers of the policy," Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republic of California said.
The Centcom leader fails to the top of the organization.
The 10-side report described detailed sustainable problems of the Central Chamber in the description and analysis of American effort at the train of Iraq forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although no decision-making evidence that Obama's superior representatives have ordered to amend the reports, the report states that the analysers had the idea that Centcom leaders were under pressure to present a more optimistic view of the risk represented by the Islamic State or IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many printing reports of the Central Chamber, Declaration and Declaration of the Conference were significantly more positive than the events in the ability”, states the report.
For example, the representative of Centcom publicly declared that the primary military attack on Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains still under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is after months of investigation fully," in the statement of Mr Mike Pompeo, the representative of the Republican Party of Kansas, stated.
Since the middle of 2014 to half 2015, the highest position of reporting services of the United States Centre has been manipulated with the outcome of the reporting services to guarantee the risk of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans compiled a group of work after learning about the concerns of the analysis that information on the reporting services related to the Islamic State was manipulated.
After the report published on Thursday, further investigation shall follow more detailed examination.
In the reporting services, Centcom is conducted further investigations conducted by the General Inspector of the Defence Minister.
The Democracy members of the Committee for Reporting Services published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to certain conclusions of the work of the group of Republicans.
“In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very difficult process for the establishment of information assessment on IS and Iraq security ingredients” said in the statement of representative Adam B.ship, President of the Committee and representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam's statement, this process “was leading to the crossing of reporting services outputs, ” he harmed the morality between analytics and “inadequately regarded the unconscious opinions”.
However, the ships and democracy claim that they have not found any evidence that the White House would try to press Centcom's analysis to adapt their conclusions according to "the proposals or politics".
The preliminary outcome of the parliamentary investigation was published on Wednesday in Daily Beast.
Loni in August New York Times informed about the current investigation of the General Pentagon inspector, which was started after Centcom's analysis.
Commander-leader Patrick Evans, speaker of Pentagon, said in the statement that the Defense Minister of Parliament's Report will comment because the investigation of the General Inspector still continues.
However, he noted that "the experts sometimes do not agree with the interpretation of complex data and that the reporting community and the Defence Minister welcome a healthy dialogue on these principles of national security issues."
The investigation has the impact on the question of whether the American bombing is successful in Iraq and Syria (a decree that now declares the increased amount of defense representatives).
However, the Latvian accusation addressed questionnaires about how President Obama can be concerned that the central arms sincerely value the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis places.
The criticism of the reporting about the Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than ten years when the analysis of reporting services to Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research work in which the administrative President George W. Bushe - despite many analytics - had a small unit in Iraq and had only a little time to think about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the reporting services of the Islamic State.
Last year, the Authority notified that the Hooker's team was raised to conclude that despite public statements of reaction, the aircrafts against the raffination of the Islamic State have not been significantly weak by the financial resources of this terrorist group because the group was building a temporary raffinery and selling the rope on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the detection was not translated outside the central ship.
Commander Centcom, Mr. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then detailed the criticism of the past year after many lawmakers viewed the Senate's testimony of the war too positive.
General Austin departed in April and replaced her in Centcom, General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States won the earthly hoke in the fourth ship in a series, so today it will be playing a decision in the British team.
Katie Bam in the bathroom against Japan, who ended with victory 6:1, shot three and only a day after for a American woman's earthly hoke team, shot the first two hooks in which America struck India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five in two stocks are a successful memory, but Bam (27) said she wasn't sure she had ever done something like that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong to those who're recording their boxes.
But this knows: Americans at the Olympics tours lead to 4 and shares the first place in the group with the Great Britain, who remained on Thursday after Japan 2:0 was defeated.
Great Britain and the United States with the saturday in the last hole of the first road.
Both teams were in the quarter final and the ship will decide who of the six teams will end first and who on the other hand.
The team from the first place will avoid the strong Danes who are on the front of the second group.
Whatever the Sabbath travel ends anyway, the Americans here have caused their surprising boss to break, four years after they ended between 12 teams in London games.
That team was Bam, too.
She grows in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and the hokey on the ground hoke first took in her hand when she was 3 years (her elder sisters played in Drexel) and entered the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest game at all.
Olympiade disappeared in 2008 because she did not get to the final record.
Then it arrived in 2012, when it did not have too much eating or eating, nor members of its team.
The next year he was trained by Anglikanig Parnham and things began to change.
"Cultural change, soul, physical change," said Bam.
We haven't had the work in London as we have today.
We've made a complete turnover.
On Thursday night, Bam started in the first half of the shooting, known from nearby.
India entered the bathroom without victory in the tour, but the team appeared as a surprising force and held the score 1:0 until the conclusion of the third quarter when Bam used the opportunity.
She ran on the left side of the playing field, and then shot into the middle and shot the ball into the gate to get the Americans to the leader 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last one in half of the fourth quarter.
The assembly of the Americans, Jackie Briggs, who in each of the three victories helped one, was at all the first time on the tour.
He's in a nice form.
Like Bam.
"Now we're in a good place," Parnham said, but as good it is, it's going to take care of the outcome of the Sabbath story.
Without trampoline in olympical dilution
It's anxiety where you are, it's interested in how many hours it's -- it's olympias.
From the event in Riu de Janeir, it is to feel a sustainable, unwritable and disappointed competition and effort.
It's like the olympical origin itself would be a ugly staff coffee that is transferred from the spectator of the floor, the gympist and the triatlonist.
You can't enable TV, read newspapers or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in a coffee, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or unmortality between Michael Phelps and Chadem le Clos.
And then it's Logan Dooley, too.
Dooley, a surprising lover of a woman with an olympy in the faces, is on the olympy first, and may also be among those who are named in households in the main time sending between the advertising and the meetings of sponsors if he was a flood, a gimnast or even a sharm.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest in California fights for the olympical gold in the trampoline shoes.
The Olympical Fire doesn't light on all competitions the same.
Far from the middle, a little in the shadow are sports that are not generally recognized: shot from air weapons, luxury, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always succeed in the classic floor, and it will probably be ruled.
But if I'm able to name my extraordinary favorite, let me be warned of an inappropriate crap of trampoly.
Although the springs on the trampoly are the olympical sport since 2000, when they were first listed on games in Sydney, it remains after 16 years of intervention this sport almost without notice - many people I asked, nor knew it was a olympical sport.
We can go about regional hospitality.
The United States had never obtained the medails on the trampoline shots and no athletes had reached to the final until 2012.
The prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in a female category between China and Canada.
This year, the golden medals from London will deal with Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The springs on the trampoline have, but yet another wedding, partly because the ear of the unclean will seem more likely to be at the clown university than on the olympide.
I have to admit that I'm not a professional, but only a neighbor of the country.
It has a comic potential - comic vibration of indigenous reflection - but also the pleasure of gymnastic and deterioration, two sports that combines in itself.
The word “trampolina” is exported from the Spanish “el trampoline” which means “scockan table”.
Aspiring champion is going to a huge trampolyne, which is shooting up to 10 meters high and predicting the composition with a number of elements (salt, heat and combination) before they finally get back on their feet.
According to the official Olympical Programme, the implementation, difficulties and “forwards in the air” are evaluated.
In Rio, he will conquire twenty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The obscure trajector of the olympical road is forward.
The warfare of gold medails must go further, more and more high, sometimes until the end, otherwise there and back, up and down.
They are trying to reach not only the target bar or the start of the wall, but as the television reports indicate, also another mental line: the world or the olympic record.
This unique attempt is awesome, amazing, a little fanatic - and enough to bring the wilds to tears.
But I think it's sometimes exciting when you follow the olympide.
The springs on the trampoline in this regard are a deal.
The path of the athlete on the trampoline is the direction up.
There's no move forward.
He or she will reflect, as if they were in a state without weight as astronomy, fly up, then down, and then again without wearing up.
Without competition and, of course, neither difficulty, but after the duration of the composition, there is no harmful fight against the achievement of the goal, no disturbance of distance, but only perfect, nice time and gravity.
It's just the nearest time the olympy is approaching and the zen.
Qualification and final women are conducted on Friday afternoon, at 13 hours of the east time, and men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will finally send in the afternoon block, starting after both days in 14 hours.
In the Olympic foolishness they promise a calm, pleasant moment that you will probably oversee throughout the final conflicts.
And if he is focused on only so that men's athletes will be the subject of loved views and injury - as reported in Wall Street Journal recently on the towns of the United States - then Logan Dooley's just waiting for their new fans that run after breath.
“Protest generation” in Ethiopia, the United States Yearly Connector
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrants who requested political changes in Ethiopia have reached a violent resistance to the government.
The Witnesses claim that during the staff with the police, many protestants were shot.
The threat of war in Ethiopia?
In the past decades, it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong west aliance with the growing economy.
In the past months, however, the country has experienced anti-governmental disasters that are still more dangerous.
Only in the last week, thousands of people who have requested fundamental political changes have gone into the street.
According to organizations fighting for human rights, the government's reaction was unbarmed.
The Witnesses claim that the police shot and killed the people of unarmed demonstrators.
On the burning video records of protests, which probably seem from the end of the past year or beginning of this year, the security force members are arrested as young people swallow after they have been brought to stand at the wall on their hands.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now requests a reasonable investigation.
"Always was difficult to keep this country in the garden and to make a step before it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, leading project Horn of Africa for the International Crisis Group Research Group.
Ethiopia is supported by the second most popular nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the Western.
American military and reporting services are closely cooperating with Ethiopia to eliminate the danger of terrorist attack in ́, especially in Somalia, and a few of African countries, if all, receive such a help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has developed an effective time.
Her infrastructure, in principle, improved - in the main city Addis Abeba, even drives a new station.
And the gates of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
In addition, Ethiopia can be tried to mark as a pattern of democracy - a organization fighting for human rights without prejudice to government repressions - the opposition in the country was hit, the disidents were effectively silent.
Many of them were exposed, imprisoned, murdered or cast to the wilderness.
However, it can change.
"When people grow and they do not have any other opportunity than protesting, it will come to break," said Seyoum Teshome, who is headed at the University of Central Ethiopia.
It protests all the youth.
It protests the whole generation.
It's a lot and they are related to all of the conflicts on the ground after absolute control of the power of the governing coal.
After the remote elections which have been fully criticized, the Governing Party and its associations have received the last chair of opposition held and now controls 100 per cent in Parliament.
In addition, the pressure grows on the border with Eritrea. The conflict divided this unexpected, constant border requested hundreds of lives in June.
Anylitics are afraid that separatist groups who have been at least deteriorated during the past years, such as the Oroms Freedom Front or the Ogaden National Freedom Front, may try to use and re-arma.
There are a number of factors that explain why these bitter feelings have been burned again after years of surface.
Of them is probably injurious: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate with social networks until the past few years when they have become currently available smarter phones and have improved the provision of internet services.
And even though the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, as it is currently running during the protests, many people can still communicate through the Internet proxy that is the position of these people.
A few young Ethiopians talked about how they were disappointed to protests.
There is a further solidarity between Oromas and Amhary, two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oromes and Amhars are not natural associates.
After the long term of Amhars, mostly from the Christian tops of Ethiopia, they produced political and trade and used Oromes, many of which are Muslims and live underneath them.
But that's also changing.
"We are on the way to the united lead," said Mulatu Gemech, leader of Orom.
The biggest protests occurred in the populations of Amhary and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oromos believe that Ethiopia is irregularly dominated by the members of the ethnic of Tigray, which form about 6 per cent of the population and control Army, reporting services, trade and policy.
The third day of trouble is Melese Zenawi's death.
Zenawi, the former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian Government president for 17 years until he died in 2012, when he dealt with the disease that was not given.
He was considered a tactic genius, a man who could see it as an angle.
Analytics say that especially the master has been able to discover the primary signals of uncomfortableness and use the senders to process and get the opposers on his side.
"Current regime is aware of fundamental violence," said Abdi, an analysis of the conflict.
The new president of the Government of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was extracted from relative ignorance to replace Zenawi.
To the end of Zenawi, who buried from the North Ethiopia from Tigrai, is Hailemariam from the south.
Analysis claims that he has no trust in the security service controlled by Tigreans.
Many of them are afraid that the outcome will be another blood-freeding.
As a result, Ethiopia experienced such anxiety in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what analytics mentioned as the choices that the government had removed and then stolen.
He followed a strong principle during which many protesting murdered - even though less than in the past months - and this period of disappointment has passed relatively.
The Ethiopian leaders have assessed the vice-planing of infrastructure, which is a new hostile struggle and a measureable progress in the fight against poverty.
Of course, it is obvious that the progressive growth of conflicts within the Ethiopian government did not stop.
And it comes to dangerous ethnic formation.
The past month protesters in the Gondar town of Gondar attacked commercial companies owned by Tigreans and the fight against the Tigreans on social networks was still more running.
Analytics say protests are in the inappropriate United States and other western associations.
The American Government uses Ethiopia as a base for drones over the Neighbourhood of Somalia, although she has recently declared that the foundation was closed.
While the West wants to support the democracy uniquely, he does not like to disrupt his association in such an inconsistent way.
"It is," said Abdi, "is a very swimming feed of assessing."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obam and financing IS as “sarkasmus”
Donald J. Trump tried to bagate the latest controversy that floods his campaign on Wednesday, saying that he didn't mean it seriously when sometimes this week he was on the fact that the president of Obama and Hillary Clinton were "the founders" of the Islamic terrorist group of the State.
The interpretation addressed new questions on the ability of the Republican candidate to the President to talk to the American public.
He also puts his defense in an inappropriate defense, which has been solemnly prohibited at a stormtime, and must explain that he may not think seriously of his comments.
After this meeting in the middle of the night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and held in discussions that he would not have to say that the President and Mr Clinton IS were created.
Of course, in Twitter's contribution on Friday Trump announced that he was only sarcastic.
The contribution was the repeated statement of the old one day when Trump said in some conversations that his accusation was seriously thought.
When the voting moderate Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's note, noteing that Obama was trying to destroy IS, the candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at the moment when Trump tried to take attention to his campaign to the economy while its preferences in prevalence investigations are decreased.
Trump and Clinton this week have been in Michigan's opinion on economic issues.
Trump tried to return to this subject on Friday.
On Twitter, he warned again that the Clintons are connected to increased taxation, and he noted that its speech was narrow, according to it.
Trump used the defense of sarcasm before.
At the end of July, when he scratched the wall of critics, when he came out with us that the Russians should go to Clinton's e-mails, they would have to explain their comment: "I'm, of course, sarcastic."
This approach allows Trump to press the limits of political declarations and to reduce them as necessary.
“I think that it's his way of testing in which some reports will be answered to his beneficiaries to find out how they react, and then, according to the reaction, in one or other way, “displaying”, Ruth Sherman, a communicating specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
But I also think it's rotating in its statements and he knows that they're careful enough to explain it differently.
Since the results of the pre-called investigations in his benefits continue to be lost, Trump chose a more easier tone in the last days, rather than to slow down things for the general elector.
The new investigation of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Tump was with a great decline from Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorada and very closely after it in Florida.
Trump is at all trying to avoid excuses for providing the terms that he says, but often he accuses his criticisms of misinterpretation of his words or the incomprehension of his sense for humor.
But together with Trump in the final months of the presidential campaign, they introduced Tromp's flags into an inappropriate disappointment of his dedicated power, which must be publicly behind him, whether his comments are anywhere to explore.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former primator of the city of New York, one of the most prominent Trump Stoffs, had to be able to deal with the candidate on Thursday in the conversation for CNN.
"I believe that what he says is a legitimate political comment," said Giuliani when he was asked for Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton were founded by the Islamic State.
That is true in the meaning that before Obama, the IS was almost unknown, a small organization, which he completely called a new man, and that happened because he had taken his army from Iraq.
Most of the current Republicans are trying to argue that the government of Obam, where Clinton acted as a ministerial business, allows IS to become agressive and not able to control the Middle East.
Before Friday meetings in Pennsylvania Trump continued on Twitter around it, he burned fire on the newspapers because they loved every word and were reproached to him.
He laughed with the "poor, patetic" TV students who try to understand him, and said, "It can't!"
A few democrates have been excused by Trump's excuse that it is only another evidence that the President's office is not reasonable.
The coffee was cut off from the price market. It's now returning to Greenpoint.
The Café Verb Cafe was a hot place in Williamsburg where you could only pay for ready, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee was given for 15 years.
It was naturally that she was thrown out of the house to Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the business that Verb replaced in 2014 - sells myths in the bars of shoes.
The locals have put it up as the last loss of the town growing up.
Artist Mollybapple on Twitter wrote: "New York is a change, I know, but I can't still believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is dead and from Verb is now a mid."
But if New York is a change, then it's a re-recover.
The Resurrection Verb Cafe opened the hall in November in Greenpoint, less than miles north of the p's place.
New Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the workers work there and dominates a similar, humiliated atmosphere there.
The coffee is still good.
The new Verb manager is Cisco Rodriguez, an elderly employee of the coffee, which is, rather, the owner and executive manager of the new place.
In Verb, he started in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered him to pay a move to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same career supplier and bought the same model machines for espresso.
He even used the light from the old Verb again.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started using new rules.
In the offer there are sandwiches with a swine, ova and sire, and toppings, such as the caps and the knife.
You'll also find a mix with a raw rise.
The coffee doesn't give a beer anymore, but the offerer of fresh fruits.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed the continuous impact of the pumps.
"A number of clients from Williamsburg also had to move out for prices," he said.
Last Sunday, there was one of these clients, Rebecca Oliveira.
Ms. Oliveirova (34) lived in Williamsburg and was often walking in the Verb Cafe.
She's even hit when the café moved to Greenpoint.
She said when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found that what I have is coffee and culture in Verbu," she said.
Now he drinks again coffee, but on that day, instead of his coffee of ice coffee, he gave a mixed chay, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another year old customer, is loyally going to Verb since 2003.
He's going before his work, and he's doing the same.
"In the fourth and eight here every day, as hours, I will come and prepare for me my cup with all and with oil," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add to the offer of new arrangements.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to negotiate what's usually, but sometimes he's allowing him to give him a snow, sheep, and sung.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry for his old place of trade with myths.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie have offered him to make a special mill for Verb and to use a filtered coffee from coffee.
"I think they could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Poland people of Greenpoint also accepted the coffee.
One of the new customers translated the proposal to the Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon expose it to feel his new neighbors like home here.
The new place has more advantages.
The local manufacturer of fruit-shirts wants to steal into the layer and sell a filtered coffee.
It is offered the possibility to expand the café into the neighborhood building.
Many customers are enough to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee closed, he thought he was broken his heart.
Mr. Whitt says when the coffee opened up again, enter and give it a coffee, it's like to come home.
"I missed the wheat," he said.
Depressions and food from the crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after arrival to the president's office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting in the Ovale Workshop and dinnering.
The lawyer president Roosevelt encouraged the chosen foods from the 5th avenue, such as a patrol from the households of herds and the marine jail of powder.
His menu for this day, however, was more humiliated: sheep in the way of the Devil in the Paradise, the porch pire and as the dentist of the Sweetk pudding.
“It was an act of kitchen solidarity with people who suffered,” Jane Zegelman said.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “This was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights is gastronomical history.
The last book of Andrewa Coea "Chop Suey" was about the Chinese kitchen in America, while Jane in his book "97 Orchard" explains the life story of a living house at Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", which was published on Wednesday in Harper, is an American kitchen in a large economic crisis.
They themselves showed the kitchen solidarity and with the reporter met at dinner in Eisenberg's trade with sandwich, a small strict buffet in the fourth Flatiron, which is in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) negotiated a cocktail and a sandwich with sequential olive, Andrew (57) gave a crocane, a brain of cash and a mixed greenine.
The reporter dealed with a mass carbanate, which, according to a couple, was nice to talk about food during the crisis.
"The carbanates were very favorite," she said after Zegelman.
It was sold by a bubble, nuclear and fasol carbanate.
They were produced from that property and other leaving foods that set up the ingredients.
Stop the amount of bullets you have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe was stuck.
"They would lie to you in the wheat like a wind," he said.
In years ago, the American kitchen, especially in the foreigns, was given in the form of snow buffet that you eat.
Women's teams were fed for farmers and for dinner, dinner, and dinner.
They were Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "And Square Meal" follows the ways the nation was equipped with the country of diversity suddenly.
"It was the time when the food became a centrally afraid point for the American people," Coe explained why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was also feared: Mysterious foods, such as carbanates and foods of castrophes, castrophes as “in a way to use the rest,” Zegelman noted because the kitchens could hide the non-esthetical arrangements under the layer of the chrome.
The pure fruits were replaced by the sweetest dry fruit.
Maso - after a long time, the center point of American food - became a strictly allocated luxus.
The wonderful mixtures to be served as calories and survival performance had an advantage before or even with a healthy sense of breathing.
During the reviews of the book containing recepts, Zegelman prepared a periodic meal of a cuped cibule filled with olive oil.
"It wasn't a favorite increase on the dinner table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized: "It was surrealistic."
It doesn't come to the throat of the bullet.
It was typical for many home recepts.
So, as never before and never later, household economy - including Louise Stanley, the Federal Agency for Home Economy in 1923 to 1943 - conducted food habits of the country.
They published recepts and articles in newspapers and magazines, invited women to overcome the burden of the budget, and lights, such as mythanish spaghets with darkness, changed to swimming foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical clusters.
Moreover, in the response of the Government to her hunger citizens, as well as under President Herbert Hoover, "I'll give me a cup."
While he was publicly praising the simple Iowa pharmacist kitchen of his childhood, he stood as a elected millioner who became.
"Happy to eat the continental kitchen, like fish with a cock," Andrew Coe said.
He ate in the cool room, he had smoking on him.
He was incrediblely old.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor didn't accept her to go as an example of her own asshole.
According to the book, Mrs. Roosevelt had a master who was not interested in the pleasure, which led to that “no one gave the best food in the whole of Washington but also the most unfortunately prepared way.”
A number of food habits from the crisis took away soon as the country was rebuilt on the feet.
The link remained in our continuous examination of calories and survival values, says Mr. Zegelman, and in the way it applies to breathing.
Pair says that during the writing of the book, they better understanded the food habits of Miss Zegelman’s mother - perhaps why she couldn’t eat.
"There was a real fear of breathing food," Andrew Coe said.
Zegelman commented: "The people were wrong."
There's an accident of a little bitch.
When there were clean tables at Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe dropped the dessert that was prepared at home: the Swedish diet that President Roosevelt had eat for dinner.
"He's called the Sweetch Croom," Zegelman said and added that the clothing trick was to give humiliated recepts a elegant name.
There was no cream there, just swimming, a little mouth, sugar, water, and shortcuts.
Each of them was throwing a bed into a thick wheat weight.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a right economy, he said to his wife, "It would be a little thrown hair."
Europeans: Migrants are going for doses.
The majority of birds that go to Europe comes from economic parts.
Young Russians make themselves pleasure.
That's how the serial looks when we've touched them.
A group of Russian artists, whose name is 2D Among Us, makes it fun of his family country.
The help of the photoshop creates a truck that shows funny how it seems to look if the glorious series and films are hit in Russia.
Gilead is charged to replace the costs for legal representation in the case of a patent against type C-Gloupance against the Merck Concern
The Court of Justice decided that the company Gilead Sciences Inc has a charge for payment for the lawyers which have occurred in the process of a patent against the gender type C against the manufacturers of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment was canceled by Gilead to pay 200 million for damage due to the violation of two Merck patents in relation to the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the Federal Court repeatedly discovered an anti-legal act on Merck, other than a lie under the swear and other non-etical practices.
Thursday, the Federal Court of Justice Beth Labson Freeman stated that Gilead has a decree on payments that have occurred in relation to the representation in the case.
Merck is trying to get Gilead, who dominates the market of drugs of a new generation against gender C, which can heal more than 90 percent of patients with this hepatic disease.
The case comes from 2013 when Gilead and Merck complained each other and claimed that they were owner of the basic research for sofosbuvir, the active pharmacokinetics from Gilead.
American supported military units claim that they have received full control over the city of Manbidž
The United States supported military units received full control over the north town of Manbidž near the border with Turkey after the last battle of the Islamic State from the city, introduced the speaking group on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Power (SDF) is now running the city after the rest of a group of radicals hidden in the city.
The units freed over 2,000 civilians who were detained by radicals, said to Agent Reeux Sharfan Darwish from the SDF Alliance and the military Council of Manbidge.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still looking for it," said Agent Reʹs.
In 2015, Clinton won $10.75 million and paid a federal tax of 34.2 per cent
Hillary Clinton published its tax recognition for 2015, in which it was stated that the presidential candidate for democracy and her husband had an income of $10,75 million in the year concerned and took a tax of 34,2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton had 1 million dollars on charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation (Clinton). Expert Bill Clinton contributed to the joint cash a total amount of the honorary $5,3 million per award, and the former ministerial award granted a receipt of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for his book on its action to the Ministry.
Clinton partners, American Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, and their wife, Anne Holton, have published tax recognition for 10 years.
In 2015 they paid a tax of 20,3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are still a pattern of financial transparency," Jennifer Palmieri stated, which helped Clinton's campaign.
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hidden for false excuses and comes from his former promises that his tax recognition will be published.
It is usually that candidates to the president of the United States will publish their tax recognition, even though they do not have the law.
Trump, New York Trademan, and his lawyers quoted the United States Tax Committee audit as a d’off for its refusal to publish the tax acknowledgement.
"Your move," said the host of Hillary Clinton's campaign on Twitter and called on the tax recognition of the Democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, the special Trump's adviser, said on Thursday CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish the tax recognition until the audits are completed.
According to the Trump critics, including the Republican candidate for the President of 2012, Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, agree that its refusal addresses questions about its pure profit, charity contributions, trade transactions and other relations, including Russian relations.
Clinton is on the question strongly opened and published on Friday a video in which it is in the high position of the Republic on the Trup to publish its tax acknowledgement.
On Thursday, he refers to economic questions in Michigan in his statement.
"He refuses to do what all the final candidates did to the presidential office after decades - to publish their tax recognition," she said before the people.
The Politic Organization noted that Trump was paying any or very low tax in the last two years of the 90s, and the New York Times publicist had experienced a number of tax advisers and agencies who claimed that it could be the same at present.
The taxes of federal taxes became the subject of the president's election.
Clinton advocates the rule named by a billion Warren Buffet, which would ensure that everyone who wins more than 1 million dollars per year will pay a tax at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supports us.
Last week Buffet for Clinton's meeting in Omaza, in Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate of Berkshire Hathaway, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax recognition.
Buffett said that he also passed through the IRS audit and Trump was "free" by the financial office, but the electors.
Clinton's campaign has published the tax recognition back to 2007.
Clinton, who now live in Chappaqua in New York, in average in 2007 to 2014 paid the federal tax in average of 32 per cent and a combined tax in approximately 40.5 per cent.
The tax recognition of Clinton for 2015 shows that it is only 100 dollars in their salary.
Their main investment was a low-based index fund from which Clinton had introduced a income on dividends and rates of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chi's or fire for the protection of elefants in Tanzania
Protectors of Nature in Tanzania use a neortodox way to prevent the elefants from walking into human residents - the condoms filled with chi's work on them.
This procedure was also certified by Honeyguide, who had come with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservants, promoting and schooling volunteers in the villages north of Tanzania, as to protect their homes and levels in four steps without hurt to animals.
Many of them used copies for their defence.
Friday is the world's day of elefants, which is designed to protect these animals.
"From the time that this ... tool file has been developed, we have mentioned a change in behaviour in these communities. People are much more able to keep the slones outside their field without to hurt them," said the Executive Director of the Opposition of Honeyguide Damian Bell in the statement.
By a second step, it's on the running slone to devote the battery and run cloxon.
If it doesn't seduce it, it will come to the extinction of such a "chi" named cloud.
Chi's smelled powder is soiled together with the petardo getting into the condom, and his end is exhausted so that he looks only on the bone.
After delay, the condom is exploded and in the air is spread by the cheap powder from chi.
Most of them, one bath is enough and the slone is distributed in another direction.
The final option is to determine the fuel that causes the voice, explosion.
The Jewish Regisseur came to the Berlin hotel because he removed the code for calling to Israel for the "demand" of Arabs - RT News
The French film recorder of the Jewish pêu caused a disruption in media after discovering that the hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the words of employees on the basis of the "request" of the Arab clients.
It was Lanzmann, author of the documentary photo on the Holocaust "Shoah", who ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin in the opened letter to the German Journal of FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in a list of codes for calling in the hotel.
However, the state was not mentioned among the countries where it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, Israel was removed and deleted in Berlin, the main city of Germany?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol, instead, offers an opportunity to call to Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for explaining and with the problem he turned to the hotel receipt.
The answer he received, Lanzmanna, according to his words "shokovala".
The work of the hotel replied that the measures were "determined after the leadership of Kempinski Hotels".
The register's step was more.
"The majority of our guests are the Arabs and they ask that the calling code of Israel be removed," Lanzmann cited employees in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the leader of Israel in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, signed the case as “a great destruction”.
We were scared and shocked at a distance.
It's just about it. It's a big deceit.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and also in such a hotel chain is even more shameful.
There is no need for another explanation.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," he said.
The event called a strong online reaction, people marked it as scandal.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel simply "lost" in Arab customers' requests.
“The name of you” is mentioned in another article, which indicates that the hotel situated in the noble street of Kurfurstendamm stands near the street.
According to the journal Spiegel, the hotel alone refused any accusation by marking the event as a "overview" and Lanzman was "excused".
"Never has been issued a direct order" to not include Israel in the list of call codes, quoted by the representative of the hotel of Kempinski.
Adds that call code was added to the list.
Police used the gas and gum projects against protesting Brazil students
The center of students and police came in San Paul in Brazil on Thursday, when students met on demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police against Protestants used the gas and gum designs.
The problem was disappointed when government order services tried students to grow, which ended using gum designs and slide gas.
The demonstration has participated in several hundreds of students in order to express their concerns from plans.
Among us, the State of San Paulo Geralda Alckmina to protect money is also closed by hundreds of public schools and the movement of 300 000 students.
Some of the demonstrators were possible to see how they accept signatures on the walls against the provisional President Michael Temer.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the demonstrators were released to the street for the support of Dilmy Rousseff's meeting president, when he decided to make a seat in the country about its complaint.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 % - RT Business
According to the Russian highlights in Iran, Levana Dzhagaryan increased after the distortion of the sanctions between Moscow and Teheran, the trade turnover was 70.9 per cent.
As the lawyer said, since the international sanctions against Iran were cancelled, the interests of the Russian fires were increased in the land.
The Russian companies renewed the existing connections with Iran while the new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further extension of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran," Džagaryan said.
He realized that during the first five months of 2016, the trade trading between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same area for 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iranium increased by 91.5 per cent and reached $697 million.
The Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent by 158 million dollars.
The shock growth of the trade has ensured the supply of machine equipment, ground vehicles and weapons, " said the lady.
Džagaryan also expects Russia to visit the record number of tourists from Iran this year.
The Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visions, mostly travellers, to the citizens of Iran.
Furthermore, Iran was first obtained among the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of tourists from Iraq in Russia will be convinced from the remote year," he said.
At the same time, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians.
"I can particularly recommend a visit to the city of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the memory of ancient Persian civilization is in a good state," he said.
Shot Callum Skinner quickly goes home after the Brits got gold in cyclistics
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered last night in the garden of glory in a man's team sprint in Riu when the three VB team had a title from London 2012.
Thirty-five-year-old patriarch from Glasgowa was in the role of the farm that he took for his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend rejoiced when he joined the goal and stole victory from the favorised hand of New Zealand.
British won four years ago and Hoy gained fifth of his six olympical gold medals.
And the same trick repeated after the end of the sixth modesty on the world championship in the road cyclistic in March, even though Hoy finished his career.
The problem between Peking and London was the refund for the specialized leader of Jamie Staff.
Thus, Hindes just appeared at a time.
After Hoye was leaving, he also released the place that he tried to fill Kian Emadi and Mattymptton.
Skinner was a British trainer man and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was with Hoy shampion four years ago - and Skinner reached the Olympical record at the time of the employment, but the triangle took the first round of New Zealand.
And the British triumph got gold in the team.
Hindes was lightly behind his round, but Kenny's team switched forward and Skinner's leader held.
The change in the strategy was a large part of the transformation when Hindes went to higher translation to relax and enable Kenny and partly Skinner to keep time.
Hoy carrier followed from his BBC comment position and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes went up to the podium, he didn't leave their eyes.
Thirty-twenty-year-old Skinner, a parent from Glasgowa, said, "It's a negative comparison."
I'm here to get the best of myself and honor my name.
We created a olympical record in the final and we hit the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After the triumph near Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he was approved after a weak start.
The note later stood back, and the British companions had no opportunity to revoke.
This time this victory has not occurred to any such problem.
Hindes said, "I felt like London with all these British flags."
In the last three months, we've been all like a team.
We lost in many world travels, so winning olympias is simply possible.
It's one event, one golden medal for a nation who won seven of the ten competitions in Peking and London.
This must be a progress indicator in the next five months, then waiting for us on the highway for five successful days.
With the form Kenny's introduced, it's not impossible that Hoy's success would repeat and win on one olympy three golden medals at the same time.
It would then be for Kenny - which is exactly a day of 12 years older than Hoy, also birthday on 23 March (that date seems to be holy for the British sport, this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - represented a total of six golden and one silver medal.
Like how much Hoy got.
As the next Kenny's going to take a sprint that starts and takes three more days.
A 21 - year - old boy from Bolton said: “Now I enjoy this.
The team drive is the best.
You win with the finals.
To say the truth, wining for myself is a little single.
Hindes said, "When he wins two other golden medals, he should have a rider title."
It was the only medal base that day, but the British were waiting for further good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed ́ncy, Steven Burke and Owain Doll were the best in the trip of companions at four miles.
We ended with time 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The round and final (22:42) shall be carried out at the second day of the travel, which is reached by Wiggins.
He discussed with Commissioners yesterday before the carrier, when the decisions invited her to fix the height.
At the time of the bathroom, women who continue and end tomorrow reached Laura Trottová, Joanna Rowsell Shandowa, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie world record with time 4:13.260.
The VB team met on his strong road cyclism team and controlled the medium period of Olympics and obtained a lot of medal.
After the execution of exceptional performances showing the full prevail in Peking and London, the expectation was decreased during the preparation for Rio.
In the background, dramatic events occurred, in the immediate order of the technical director Shane Sutton in April for accusation of sexualism and discrimination, and the end of the career of majors such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of the trains on the floor seems to be made, the legendary reputation that the British team will be able to give a spice with perfect time, could be confirmed again.
The incertain future of the landscape in Portland after the end of energy supply
The future of the Portland Clinic Clinic in Victoria - and the workplaces of hundreds of jobs - is uncertain because of the electricity that the company resources electricity and who informed about the purpose of one of the owners of the plants to complete electricity supply. It is expected that all electricity deliveries will be reduced.
This step takes place after the Government of the Victoria State earlier in this year decided that it would not continue to provide the contributions that the undertaking maintains in the course of proceedings.
The validity of the twenty-year-old award will expire in November.
Alcoa Portland may be in a threat to 2000 jobs.
When closing, it can be threatened up to 2000 workplaces - direct or indirect.
And because the bathroom needs about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, it can reach further lavinity impacts.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Tavier Point Henry, which led to the closure of the electricity.
The Alcoa campaign in Portland is distributed and threatened to close it.
This step follows several years of speculations regarding the future of the company, in reaction to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices for the production of a bathroom.
AGL, which adds a large-scale cycle electricity from the Loy Yang A electricity in Latrobe Valley valley, stated that it expects some of the other three owners to be determined to end.
The majority of the business owner is the joint company of Alcoa and Alumina, small business shares holding the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects the Portland train to continue to work, therefore, with other words that the high-speaking request will continue from the stakeholder” she said.
AGL pointed out that with the provinces are the same as the “certificate compounds” which should be entered into force since November 2016.
With the date of May 12 months of responsibilities, their validity will be finished in 2017.
“AGL continues to assume that they will participate in the profit for the financial year 2017”, declared the electricity.
Any potential impact on the AGL profits since the financial year 2018 continues currently to be obtained by a strong view of the commodity market for the high-trade prices of electricity.
AGL stated that the value of contracts in its annual books had already been recorded in the amount of 187 million dollars "for the purpose of concluding."
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate “not affected its ... ability to operate a tavir or to ensure the supply of electricity in the stock”.
The American company noted that in 2010, Loy Yang had concluded a contract for 20 years that had to start paying since November of this year, although still needed to explain why it had been dismissed.
Analysis are very careful about the possible closing of the Portland Tavier in Victoria and Tomago's bathroom near Newcastle, as a result of weak economics in the sector.
The leader of AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysis at the beginning of this week, said that Portland needs approximately 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts annually.
If both of these enterprises were downloaded from the market, this would mean significant decrease in the market [electric energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only a realistic TV show of Kardashian - now it's a cartoon of Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), the model and the fourth daughter of the mother-manager of Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the title page of the American Journal of Vogue.
Kendall, the ambassador of the labels of Estee Lauder, who was transferred to a fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday at its instagram.
"In the room full of people I love, I want to weep at this title page," Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the title page followed a strange (or simple continuation of humor in the delivery of Kardashian?) inscened videos in which the whole family of Kardashian-Jenners (Farm Robs and Caitly and all the favorite uncles with them, Kee’s producer up Ryan Seacrest). On the contrast, they forgot their sisters only that the scene could end with the classic road: they prepare a secret party.
It's a surprised line of every "bread-feeding" work of the child TV show (Seacrest) says: "You thought we forgot you?" with the honesty of a drawn queen in the order in eight hours, but Krisaak needed to make sure that the final girls in this publication could survive.
Because when we look at the series of Vogue magazine, we certainly entered the new era of Kardashian.
The elderly sister Kim may have touched Kendall on the cartridge of Vogue (he was on her with her husband, Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the series of magazine issue is a different ligue.
The newspaper Vogue is the most sold number of the year.
The edition that the book for advertising is more than the modern magazine is attached to a whole number of insectors (Fashionists claimed that from 832 pages in the remote issue was 615 sides with advertising).
The discovery of a star that appears on the title page is unexpectedly expected, so it is not surprised that in the next two years the magazine photographs have been avoided before its official publication.
Among women that have occurred on the packaging in the past, belongs to Naomi Campbell, Linda E’list or Kate Moss.
In the past years, the title page has shown more "celebrites that make models" than "models which are celebrites".
Jennifer Lawrence, the host of Oscar and the ambassador of Dior's label, appeared on the titler in 2013, with the honor of Lagy Gaga in a year later.
But even though it is very unlikely that Kendall - which magazine describes as a "small model" of its generation - falls into the first category, it will be in a very good company.
These celebrities are not the family of known people, nor the stars of realistic shows, or children of the day, who are going to do well-scapped videos (and when Jenner represents this everything).
They are demonstratively talented women that result in the fear of the industrial.
Beyonce, who appeared on the title page, had one of the strongest years in her career through the release of the album of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone's overcome from Jenner's success.
Her position in the world of mode will be difficult because of her reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the Victoria's Secret, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June, and called it "small girls".
These feelings have been rebuilt with the report that Jenner's going to appear on Vogue's packaging.
But this insatisfaction isn't in place.
Kendall Jenner's on the cartridge Vogue.
It's a supermodel in the right word of sense.
He's headed for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you make up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you photos of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells the daughters of Cindy's Wowford, which she photographed for the LOVE magazine.
And at the moments of freeness, she's in reality show, perhaps just as one of the ways to see Courtney and her children.
The Community Legal Aid Centre for Annual Rejecting 160 000
More than 160 000 most threatened citizens are rejected in Community centres each year, and in the sector themselves, they wish to have further financial restrictions to the over-treated service.
In Queensland, three of the five - mainly people in progress, immigrants, threatening work, victims of violence, and people without financial abilities to fight unfair movement and similarly - are rejections already at the time they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so busy to swimming, are intended for further clusters.
Since June of the next year, these legal aid centres will come to another 30 per cent of federal funds.
The Director of the Communities Aid Centre in Queensladu James Farrell said that, according to the latest total reports of the National Community Association of Aid Centres, it was found that five thousand people were rejected annually.
Mr. Farrell said that without revoking the decision of the Federal Government, the Federal Government will be worrying.
"The Community Legal Aid Centre in Queensland are chronicly underfinanced, which means that thousands of people are rejected of lifely important services that they do," he said.
People who have disappeared from the relations with the violent, people with excessive and protective debts, families who come out with discharge, workers who are wrongly released - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance to get the help they have.
Since June 2017, the Federal Government decreases the financing by 30 per cent, which will lead to further thousands of threatened people from Queensland will have to focus on complex legal problems without aid.
We invite the State Representative and Senator Queensland George Brandis to prohibit this shortage of funds so that people can get help when they get to legal problems.
In the past year, the Government of the State has made its obligation to ensure the financing of legal aid up to the international prospectus.
Now it is time to look at the needs of the Community legal aid centres and the community of their customers and the Government of Palestine must invest in this important work.
Lamentation on the campaign Donald Trump after the member of the Chamber was probably entering the weapons
New York: The campaign of Donald Trump was made a complaint for evident inactivity after they had been informed that the operating manager in North Carolina in February had planned a weapons on the member of the Chamber during the jazzle.
Incidence was described in a court record, which in the middle of the State Court in Charlotte had translated Vincent Bordini, an ex-software campaign.
Bordini said that he had waited for months to resolve inside, before he was raised to the conclusion that “they will stand like this”.
Director Earl Phillip “designed the finger of the gun, gave the right indicator to the cover and placed the head of Vincent on the Czech,” said Burni in the complaint.
The record states that Burni, after complaint in the local and regional leadership of the campaign, found that at least four other people had lived the same with Phillip.
"The weapons don't have to shoot to cause damage," Burni said in the complaint.
The complaint comes only two days after the President's candidate has chosen a summary when he said to the electors in North Carolina that they could cross the owners and holders of the weapons (which is adjusted in the second section of the Constitution in the United States) if his support for Hillary Clinton is chosen and will be able to appoint their judges.
Trump's campaign says that the medium of his words was thrown out of the context and that Trump was not forced.
Bordini in the complaint requests a refund campaign for a lack of supervision and from Phillip to threaten personal security, illegal use of violence and emotional injury.
Trump's speaker Hope Hicks on a report with a request for a comment immediately did not respond.
The results of obtaining expressions from Phillip were insufficient.
WCCB, a local reporting officer in Charlotta, announced that Phillip was missing recently from the campaign.
Telephone to his Advisory Company Innovative Consulting Services has never responded during a short time.
The Republican candidate to President Donald Trump has a contra-elective campaign.

British must expand the olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renovation and prosperity not only for our local communities and other than London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is a very attractive way, just like London 2012, when we have developed extraordinary efforts, and have assured that all our nations and regions will be able to weaken from the Olympics Hers.
Olympical games mean great contributions for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities, we create 10 000 new educational places, 40 000 new jobs and relate to the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Like before London Olympias in 2012, they will find those who will think Heathrow extension is too big.
I was told that British never was prepared for olympical games and that they would be disappointed on the world's floor.
The doubters wronged in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow, they did not have the right.
It'll always be necessary to make obstacles, but Heathrow will be able to answer every question about it.
Like olympical games, Heathrow is a infrastructure project that shares many people and fires, not only a few.
Extension is the opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave heritage in the form of skills and employment in the area of the aircraft, both throughout the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent team on Heathrow, which has made an investment programme in infrastructure for 11 billion pounds in terms of termin, starts with the T5 terminal - which was chosen as the best terminal in the world five years after itself, after the T2 terminal, which was set between the two most dramatic ranways in the world.
Now they are ready to add the third ranway, which costs 16 billion livres of private investments.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success of Britain and I am convinced that Heathrow's extension will also be eaten.
It's time, and they continued to spread the spirit of the Olympics and spread Heathrow, enabled trade in the future, and left the inheritance of powers and employment that could be proud to British.

Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game on a cat and mouse in the blocking advertising
From attempts to handle applications blocking advertising, for companies that are on the online marketing has become a game on a cat and a mouse. At least one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, so only two days after Facebook announced that he would block the advertising filters on his desktop pages, Adblock Plus published on its pages a contribution that indicates that those who are able to update the filters in their program and relock the advertising on this social network.
Facebook indicated on Tuesday that his desktop website will change the encoding around the advertising to make it more difficult for advertising filters to discover what parts of the pages are advertising.
Adblock now claims that new codes have already been broken.
Ask Adblock Ben Williams in the blog wrote that “This is a war between the community of open source blocking advertising and those trying to bother from the time that the advertising blocking was found” and that Facebook probably will come with another own business.
The fact that the company's own largest social network in the world involved in war only shows how a big problem with the blocking of advertising for the industry has occurred.
According to the study, Pagefair and Adobe performed the tight lonely used advertising filters around the world, about 200 million people - at least four times before it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of the Facebook advertising, and every day Facebook from the mobile equipment visits 1.03 billion active players.
The speaker noted that the company was going against advertising filters on the desktop because mobile advertising filters on mobile networks and Instagram does not work.
Advertising on desktops still represents so high that Facebook has decided to invest.
Facebook also pointed out on Wednesday that he would update the tool for "ad preferences" to give people the opportunity to control how advertising is shown.
On Thursday Facebook announced that the new Adblock filters were concerned because they could also block the contents of the advertising sites.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people, and we want to solve this problem," said the speaker Facebook in the e-mail statement.
The blocking of advertising is an insensitive tool, and therefore we have been focused on building tools such as Ad Preferences, which give people control.
A woman struck the car of the Swiss Distante
The victim was lying on the remote side of the night.
Police is looking for witnesses of the events in which on Thursday in the early hours, a few vehicles were taking a woman who probably tried to spend suicide.
The accident occurred at A1 remote Morges in Vaud Canton shortly after midnight on Thursday.
The police in Vaud in the statement stated that the actor's trusted action was lying in the darkness of the road and overlooked a few cars.
It's fair that the victim, a woman in 49 C.E., wanted to kill and hit her a few cars, including a cost vehicle.
She died in the place.
Some drivers have already been heard, but they have not yet been identified by the police, but the police calls these drivers and all the rest who were witnesses of accidents to register.
Criminal investigation, "logical" steps in the investigation, such as this, said for Le Tribune de Geneve's legal representative Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to find out whether some of the drivers involved will be charged with an accusation.
Did it be possible to prevent the emergency?
This has to discover the complainant," Hofstetter said.
On the basis of two similar cases of the next five years, the drivers seem to be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was about a person walking along the remote - was decided that the engineers could not expect a walker that passes over the remote night, as the news reported.
Last year, the police officer was released of the accusation of murder from the imbalance after the night in August 2014, and killed the man who was located in the A1 distant of Paynerne.
In the court, the victim was a 22 - year - old drinking alcohol, and it was stuck on the road.
The Court felt that the police breath - which reacted to the emergency calls - was in a proper way and that the presence of a man on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable,” said the judge.
Any person with information on the quarter incident in Morges should be registered at the phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.

Pat and Mat celebrate forty years.
The unrestraiable Path and Matt, whose effort is increasingly in disaster, enjoys small and big beasts for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening series of repository Lubomira Benese had the Prime Minister on August 12, 1976.
After the appearance of this animated series, which now knows strangers in more than hundreds of countries of the world, were drawn by the creator's shops and the Registry Lubomira Benes, which he thought for the magazine with two boxes of Mr. Ouholic and Sedlec.
Benes then called to cooperate with the dramatic of Jiří Kubič and the Creator of Vladimir Jiranka and together made a movie of Cutchs.
Today, the figure with the yellow and red trick and the kitchen and the dairy was found in 1979, when he started in the Short Film of Praha to produce a series for the Slovenian TV.
The names of Pat and Mat were then obtained in 1985, this time they were already running directly for the Short Prague movie.
In 1990, Lubomir Benes founded his own study of an animated AIF movie in Prague and Curych, where further parts were produced.
After his death in 1995, other works with other creatures continued, and many of them were shared by Benez's son Marek.
Now there are over ninety episodes with the stories of these wheels, which all sleeps under their hands, but never hurts themselves and are full of optimism, ideas and cutiles and, finally, they are satisfied with their work, which will add to a known geth "...and it is it!".
Pat and Mat even moved from television screen into books, DVDs and districts, or other games with Pata and Mata are the hit of every game.
An advice for Fiji and for the two-year Harmonie.
The end of the week is in the sign of the coach, we have chosen one sport for you and one of your lives.
Both have a good end.
Let's go look at it.
Fiji has reached historical success.
What is the result of the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has a same friend and she's happy with her.
And for what things are people most spent in the aircraft?
This is a weekend view from the world's webs.
The medaile from the olympical hers.
History success celebrates the ocean state of Fiji.
The ragby election of this island struck in the Olympical tournament final of the seventh ragby team of the Great Britain.
It's the first medail that Fiji got on the olympy for himself.
Waiting for the winning of the first valuable metal was sixty years after sending the first exhibition to olympic games.
The great debt for success takes the trainer Fiji.
However, it's ironic that I'm Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been conducted since 2013 and after the final how the British citizen could be satisfied from its countries.
"Let's go to play free and easily and see if the biggest story in our history can be able," said the trainer before the final.
Fidži finally controlled her sovereignly, and a small state with 900 thousand people now lives in a olympic conquest.
The French journal Le Monde brought a report.
New friend and lucky for a little girl.
2-year Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who lives without hand and has received a new friend from 11 months.
The lady looks like her.

He has a survey.
I saw her representing the final kid with the word Hi, I'm Harmonie and I have no hands, added my mother.
Look at the joy of the girl.
What's the most we're doing in the airport?
CNN brings discovery, according to which people in the airports most will lose for the packed water.
The Gudson's travel travel has published data for the last year, where it is in 10 products that customers purchasing in his business in airports most often.
The water was sovereignly first.
The drinks were generally very favorite, in the first decade, eight of them were placed.
The nineth place contained a large packaging of M&M bonbons with cocoa.
And you can find out who's closing the first ten?
As the only of the above things, it can't be eat.
According to CNN, this is the Wall Street Journal.
Among the following annual newspapers sold on airports belongs to: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines, these are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Universal Sovereigns.
We're just going to win, we laughed Murray with Bond.
Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have sovereignly kinged a category of two without a feedback seven years and their dominants have also confirmed the Olympics games in Riu de Janeiro.
In the first view, the non-equivalent two of them went to a smaller postal after olympy in Peking and since 2009 lost competition.
On the Rodriga de Freitase Lago, they were assigned to the quarter end of the 69th exhibition.
What are we different than the finals?
We're just nice, Murray's already impressed through the olympical regate when he had to answer questions about the domination of the new Zealand two.
Honestly, we're not doing anything different for the final.
We're just training strongly, very strongly.
And we're still trying to improve our technology, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their control is careful even because they are physically different.
Murray is a two-meter and stoking chain, academically looking Bond is five metres smaller and 15 kg easier.
Moreover, he has a distant respect.
Bond's studying and acquiring finance, Murray has a charitable boxer storage behind him.
Even because of this, it doesn't spending much time outside the town.
Eric's coming into the ship in the basic way we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I have the tendency to think about what it can show, acknowledged Bond, who even on the printing graphic suggested that the dominant in the owner is Murray.
He just answered first and Bond waited for his opportunity.
However, in the water, the opposite will be destroyed by the calm force.
They eat their time, and maybe they are still not in the middle of the traits, they have not found any recipe for their gradual dealing yet.
We're moving to a 2 km trace, and we've never wanted to go the first kilometer over.
We're just trying to take time that nobody else can.
We know what we have to do, and they won, said Murray 40 years old.
With his four - year younger partner, he got seven gold medals to the world’s mastership.
They triumphed in 2007, when both members of the golden four were uncovered.
Just after an unexpected failure, the most olympics in Peking for a year were decided to move to two without a feedback.
On the olympy in London, the biggest damage of their career was apparently opened and the dominants also confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the trainer said to us, and they didn't ask anything.
This time it was a little more funny.
We knew that it would be damnly hard, and we had to make sure we were psychically good on that, Murray said.
We know everyone wants us to get out of the throne.
We've always got the throat on our back.
But we're trying to be a half step before all, added.
NASA climate model: Venus was ever resident
According to the project of a new NASA climate model, Venush was ever resident.
Sciences in the Goddard NASA Institute for University Study developed a model for the examination of Venush using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate studies.
The model was proposed to determine whether on Venus, whose surface is heavy, without water and soft CO2, could be dominated by submines of similar submimes on Earth.
Scientists have already said that the low rotation of Venus could explain its low atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, Venus could sometimes be able to slowly turn back with a rare atmosphere like the Earth.
The model was also undertaken by the previous topgraphy of Venush.
The planet was probably more dry than on Earth, but sometimes there was enough water and geografic diversity on it to rule on it and provide protection against the refreshment.
The Venus also used the sun before, which was 30 percent more dark.
“In the simulation of the GISS model Venushe during the slow turn, she exposes its day side to the sun at least two months once,” explained GISS Anthony Del Genio in the new report.
This occurs in the burning of the surface and the creation of rain that creates a huge level of darkness that is protected as a rain and surface from a excessive solar heat.
The survey is the air with the mean temperature of something less than at present on Earth.
The model set up the story of Venus a similar evolution, which had previously been the planetary creators.
Although Venezuela was probably resident in the past -- over a few billion years -- it was exhibited too hot and ultrafial backup.
Its oceans were covered and the water couples were burned by ultrafial light.
The water fled and was only a hot atmosphere of carbon oxide with a mortal gas gas - this is Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new climate model of Venus in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy resorted to a Colorado Avalanche team trainer post
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday his trainer post and vice-president of hokey operations to the Colorado Avalanche team, as he pointed out the ability to participate in the decision process in the issues of the team.
The executive vice-president/general manager Colorada Joe Sakic confirmed the step and stated that the club will immediately begin searching for a new trainer.
"In the last three years, I acted as the main trainer and vice-president of hokey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, weakness and decision," said the fifty-year Roy in the statement.
I thought long and intensely during the years how I could improve the team, give him the depth that he has, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the views of the trainer and the vice-president of the hokey operations are needed to be in accordance with the organization's vision.
It must also have the opportunity to participate in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These submines are not fulfilled at the present time.
The Sakic that Roy adopted on 23 May 2013 thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we take him to the future a lot of happiness.
Roy was nominated to Jack Adams as the best league trainer during his first square with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He brought the team to win 112 points and the first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, had been with Minnesota in the first round of play-off and during the last two years, the stocks did not go up after they had been.
The Avalanche team in the 2015 2016 reached score 39:39:4 and missed five points to get the second wild cards in the west.
Brother Roy, who wrote to China glory, wined Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
Workers in the North Sea renew the conversations and interrupt the stage
The Supreme Representatives of the Parties noted that taxes for the work of the Northern Sea are suspended while all the parties of the dispute were gathered to a new negotiation round.
To the counterparty of the Wood Group's field service company, the Royal Du Shell has been affected in the Northern Sea areas.
“Wood Group and United Nations and RMT Committees may confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for the solution of current accidents”, states the statement.
In the next week, we will have a number of weeks of meetings in a whole day where we will try to see the problems from the new angles.
According to the committee organizations, their recent actions, which, according to their words, were the first of more than 25 years, were to protest against salaries up to 30 per cent.
The Wood Group in the year decreased the rates and paid to its suppliers in Northern Sea about 9 per cent less because of the negative market pressure.
The decrease of the rate of the company comes after the ten-percent reduction for the coastal company in 2014.
The company claims that additional coverages would make the company a space to compare with market decreases.
Shell, on the other hand, expressed thousands of people from his paying lists and announced the plans for the release of operations in the field of land and gas up to 10 countries for modernization of its processes - without mega-fuzing with the British Energy Group.
Energy companies are under pressure for the low prices of the roof, the economic ability associated with the red decision of British abandoning the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, the member of the Parliament of Scotland Dave Anderson met the committees in order to negotiate one of the largest unemployment accidents of the entire generation that led to the staff in Northern Sea.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital for the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we have an economy that works for all, not only for some," he said in the statement.
For comparison, in 2016 it is expected at least 1,4 billion dollars of investment in new projects in the North Sea, while the average of the next five years was about 7 billion dollars.
Kepler measures the rotation of stars in the Plazads
The newest mission of Kepler's universal telescope to help the astronomes is to get the full list of the turning of stars from the Plejada Stars.
New data helps the astronomes to understand why the stars in the starcoop are at different levels, as well as how the time of turning relates to the design of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our outcomes with other stars we will learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even the story in its solar system”, Louisa Rebullav, the research worker in Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena stated in the new report.
The Starscape of Plejada is 445 light years from Earth.
A lot of stars in the loop now reach the state of growth and have appeared over 125 million years.
Now he's turning away.
At the time of the maximum turnovers, these adult stars will release a large quantity of stars.
Because these stars move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a relaxing weather on them.
Along with the old star, her turning is also slow.
Kepler measures the rotation of each star so that it measures the time between the discovery of identifiable points on the stars -- similar to the sun curves.
According to the latest data on the rotation data, the stars turn smaller than the weight of the stars.
Rebulla compares stars to dancers, more piruetes are making less than you are smaller.
"In the "balet" Plejad, we see that the slightest stars are more massive, while those who are most touching are usually very easily stars," replied Rebulla.
Because the starscape is so close, it serves as a ideal cosmic laborer to compare the quality of the stars and the rotation.
"Pleasures provide us a coat for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebullava said.
There is still much that we want to learn about how, when, and why the stars slow their turning and thus say, "Link their dance bottles to the bottles".
Rebullava and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the turnover of Plejad in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is an agreement necessary?
If I hadn't agreed, would the agreement not be concluded and could I go to another hospital after a few months?
Is it possible to work without access to specialisation education after study?
I'm concerned that in the field in which I want to work, there is now a free job in place only in some more remote hospitals, but almost half a year it could be released in another place where I would then work.
So I don't know how to resolve about that half-time, the question continues.

No legislation shall establish the obligation to conclude an agreement with the employee - disease.
The qualification agreement is a legal institution managed by the labour law and may be closed between the employee and the employee to ensure the refund of the costs covered by increased or decreased employee.
However, in the field of health, the pressure is developed to not conclude these agreements with regard to the mobility of health work and not all hospitals currently require this Agreement.
In accordance with Law No 95/2004 Sb., the provisions for the acquisition and recognition of professional ability and specialised ability to exercise the health of the doctor, the dental doctor and the pharmaceut, are expressly applied to the consideration that specialisation is considered to be rebuilding (no increase).
This means that the ­ ­ agreement may be closed in accordance with the law of work only if the costs reach at least 75 000 Kč.
No legislation or obligation to be registered in specialisation.
The Law shall only determine the submissions of the request for the inclusion in the specialisation training.
However, according to the law, the doctor is authorised to carry out a doctor's invitation already through a needed high school study, although under the law of the submines (at the professional supervision of the doctor's specialised ability in the respective office).
The Law provides for the time when the physician’s specialization may begin professional practices in another specialisation area if its contents and ranges correspond to the relevant educational programme.
Theoretics would thus be possible to start the time processed elsewhere, which would correspond to the tazanication.
However, given that I do not know the more closer circumstances of this case, a conciliation with the competent Committee of the Ministry of Health (committee and medical calls) can be recommended because the Ministry of Health of the Law provides a advisory and coherent service relating to the integration of specialisation education and its progress.
The Czech Medical Chamber also provides freely with the advisory service, which each doctor must be.
Doctors from Syrian Halabu are asked for an intervention in the United States.
The United States did not have any effort to complete the obstacles (the overall part of the city of the Government Army) and not to use their impact on the protection of civilians, but to feel from the letter addressed to the White House of the AFP Agency.
"We don't let tears, feelings, and even prayers; but we're able to create an east Hallab unfaithful zone to stop attacks, and we're taking international action that would ensure that Halab is surrounded again," said the doctors.
The Russian forces supporting the Army to President Bashara Asado have announced that from today, they will stop every day by three hours of engineering in Halabu in order to enable a safe movement to humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00, all military activities, aircraft attacks and workshops have to be stopped.
However, the UN Stephen O'Brien's humanitarian operational boss welcomed it, emphasised the need for at least two-day approach.
On Obama, according to the AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who have been acting in the east of Halabu have already been controlled by rebels.
It says that during the five years of war witnesses were violent, cruel death of unexpected patients, friends and colleagues.
The world watchs and sees how complicated Syria is, but it's just doing little to protect us.
Recent evacuation offers of a population from Syrian regime and Russia sounds like a lightly shooted evacuation, with pediatrics, chirurgs and other doctors.
The doctors noted that 42 attacks on medical equipment in Syria were nominated in the past month, from 15 to the hospitals in which they work.
We're most sad about that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
To prepare for us, small children with so severe hurt that we must choose among them those who are the most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't have the material needed, and they helped them, they described the doctors.
Two weeks ago, four newborn ones were hit when the explosion interrupted the supply of oxygen into their incubators.
They ran after the rain and then ended their life - before he could begin, they remembered.
The Army of the president of Bashara Asado, which supported Russian forces, surrounded the east of Halabu in the past weeks, was inside without food supply over 200,000 people.
Rebels under continuous Russian and Syrian airports were surrounded in the Sabbath after three weeks, and the anti-ofenzive began to be surrounded.
Both sides after they arrived in the city and its surroundings.
