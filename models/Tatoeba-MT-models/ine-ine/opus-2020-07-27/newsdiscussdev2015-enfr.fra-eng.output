It seems to be a typical rugby club.
At an English university, maybe...
Nothing to see with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, right?
Of course not, but the premium that says that it's hard in the rugby is a big thing...
Yes, finally, we don't interrupt prayers of the Muslims and we don't throw the nose of anyone during the games to drink (only, except if it is part of the game), but we're actually painted in black for some degused nights.
I never played a drink game based on the Nazi theme that says.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospectus of the first year students came to me quite typical.
In fact, this new information does not give any doubt in my eyes that they go far far from the misogyn pleasants and blagues under the alcohol company that we are often associated with the rugby teams.
The incident with the Muslim students shows particularly well that they are trying to provoke the maximum.
You don't know anything about the rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your damage and stereotypes prevent the facts?
I think the rugby LSE team is a few of the elderly students of these schools for whom the rugby of competition is a tradition.
Otherwise, old guys of the private.
Exhibition of very different environments than those playing in the rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So the "misogyne pleasants" are acceptable?
Looks like the rugby club at my university, I never saw racist behavior, but the naked courses through the campus, the flight, the mixing of goods and the misoginia were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't tell it in my last comment.
You can see it otherwise: say that your own body itself is part of this anti-trail water.
I'll win in serenity.
so this interestal cloud (ooh, not traditional:)
@lux You haven't read the article well: a small half of the water of your past has more than 4.6 billion years...
Yeah, well, even though we can think that the float of the past is in the meantime easily more than 2,3 billion years, which is not so bad that it is.
A sacred foot of nose to the catastrophes and rehealists of any powder that predict the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water is always existing.
An irrefutable evidence that the heat was stopped 20 years ago (see the notable travels of Serge Ferry financed by Total and Areva).
@manon too: In what is it evidence that heating has stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second degree and ironia, what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about the problems of the physician.
It is not questioned for the “catastrophers” as you say to be concerned about the destruction of the oceans but rather of the reduction of water reserves consumed by humans (you know the sweet water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then, most commonly, it is not the climate consumption that is the most threatening for our species, but especially the reduction of little or not renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our ways of life more and more gourmands.
As regards the study you cite and which you make the generous effort to cite the source, you are not naturally dong the truth of the conclusion.
With regard to the difficulties of mildwater, I raise the French are far away from being involved xD Then you must stop considering Ethiopian as an unfailed dogma, the ozone bed's wheat is referring quietly (100% for 2050 at the current rythm).
Yes, yeah, religiously dogmatic and irrational, not thanks.
"Therefore, you must stop considering the Ethiopian as an unfailed dogma, the ozone bed's wheat is being referring quietly" Yes, it is not as if it was a spontaneous movement that would not come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to speculate that climate heating is a need because if we educe too much CO2 our land will be in Venus.
A steel that will be captured by the action of the oxygen will catch the heat without freeing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the lock process in exponential way.
Have someone seen direct actions until now?
Or the latest sign indicating that 10 000 good men would have come on the ground to plant trees and to do what a green army should do, what could be well?
I'm probably not!
In the small brain of Abbott, maybe sending the RAAF to the Middle East is its version of a direct action.
We're going to get back, it's sure.
When are they going to get out of the town's idiot?
The latest reveals that vegetation would consume 16% of CO2 more than any climate model provides the priority for replanting.
It is no logical, because CO2 is the food of plants that are the most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to keep the flower worldwide.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been made up.
Have you seen the Green Army somewhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is increased, your argument of plant food is only a failure action.
And before you lay your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant grass is not the CO2 but the nitrogen and the suspect.
The biologically generated material may be the carbon, but this does not mean that it is the most abundant ingrass, so the argument of Silverhead is fatal and deserved to be ridiculated.
○ Action is a floor, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing money where it was most beneficial, it is now invested in where it will receive the most publicity to make liberals up to marginal electorates.
Your contribution, however, deserves the price of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants make less photosynthesis and contain less nutrition.
This means that animals and people must eat them in much greater quantities to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
It is evident that this Member is a portfolio.
Until now, it has not presented a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents it from taking away from the rules of XVII.
However, sanctifying him and not the Tevenoud is incomprehensible for a bad world, even though the UN Regulation is not a tax contract.
That this lady doesn't make any case to her honour, it appears especially as histery.
If Mitterrand had called all those who spoke Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminising of the names, the "Academia" was disappointed: "Let us say Ms. Guardian or Guardian of the Scales" (post that had never been taken by a woman until then).
Pure macism!
"The political aren" ...!
The sand , the back corner of the Republic replete , the marigot of operating guards , the table of illusions , etc ...
But the arene assumes gladiators, people who take real risks , well-pleasant , unfortunately.
When the Falkhood official sits on the label and Parliamentary Regulation by entering the + elementary civility under the fake paraplue of good ways, the sanction applies to him "the quality" for its partisan heading and the mixing of the political aren.
The behaviour of this Member is neither normal nor worth of his position.
He makes the provocation to make it talk about him.
Until now he was unknown, now he can be honoured to be known as all cancers of a primary class.
Academia at the back and we see the members are sensitive to the pocket...
The OMP will need to be able to solve its internal problems and stop providing cooks and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when we tell her what she doesn't say.
This member acts as a full teenager crisis, which causes the provocation and whose friends are going, in delegation, to see the Master to make the hours of college.
and in the defense, based on a text they have not even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatures of the UMP members.
Mr Judge, I call two expert witnesses separating a few thousand years.
That's why I like to pass time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and attractive.
The dogs, the dauphins, the otaries, the horses, they do all stupid things for the simple pleasure that they are looking for.
Instead, it would be that we would have been most of our 80 years to work, move and make stores.
What amazing phase we have reached - we are able to multiplicate by two of our lives, but we're doing the majority of it in the neighborhood.
How did we get there?
Thanks to the illusion that anthropomorphism is.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, the "communication" requires a shared symbol system.
A hard concept for you, maybe?
I think the concept of interspective communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's true.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can make a dog that I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variation that indicates whether the game is a course, an object to go searching, etc.
It's not difficult and there's no anthropomorphism – even though I'm attached to the idea that many crazy about animals are being "playing" while they're just going to do it.
Perhaps the game is not only "usual" (it may be, or not), it is just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber thinks that there is a game principle based on any reality.
"If he had learned that a woman is not an object, maybe he wouldn't have violated it" Perhaps, the hope makes life...
• the hope to give you the opportunity to live, to be in good health and to be able to answer a article today when you had to drink the information without being able to respond almost 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against ideas, and I would even have the tendency to be quite enthusiased by those who seem to be crazy with the first-border.
But when we see what many have kept from their learning at the oil, especially among the public that is the most possible for aggression on women, my enthusiasm does not find the smallest beginning of anchrage.
“ the most likely public to be delivered to agressions on women ” We would like to learn a little more.
Or instead, no, it's good, we understand.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel rose, even though it doesn't necessarily match your thinking schemes.
It is true that Neilly's youth and other beautiful quarters don't listen much in class.
She prefers playing on her iphone6.
Evry's devastated youth too!
If the reactions were not reacted anymore, Twitter would not propose to follow the Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I haven't learned anything of all this in the oil and I've never violated anyone (and it's not in my intentions).
Should I love my lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values...
The micro-society of the family is the learning of social life.
How can you undertake the reading of life when you don't know what you can't read?
And are young socialists going to schools to teach man-female equality?
It would be more effective than to make moralizing mounts on Twitter, but it would have to get out of beautiful quarters...
Grotes this campaign.
They are nowhere but to give moral lessons, it remains the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but I want to see the bread in a hair.
There's a blame there about using his bread.
The article of this week isn't going to meet it.
It's not time to make blacks around bread, man!
A little bit of appeal!
You have made a double-sensitive word game with the word "naan" to make reference to a grandmother.
60 books for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old home.
How does it make more payable, less in the ass?
Because the quality of the experience is not necessarily measured to weight or number of calories, as well as the quality of a movie or part is not determined by its length.
Yeah, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in parts that would not even satisfy a monastery?
It doesn't have any sense, and it is only a determined policy to make you buy more places.
Of course, it must not be like this.
The Sportsman in Seasalter at least is a very good restaurant where portions and prices are both high reasons.
You pay more because you are still hungry after several mini places.
More you pay, more you have chances to get a portion of children available with art in your ass.
At least they did the effort to put nappes.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before you decide that London is the only place on Earth where you can enjoy good places?
Is it the Manif for all that is only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's a kind of race of homophobs.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern "building of children" systems.
A child should not be raised in a bathroom-leaving or manufactured by an apparatus.
Battery lifting?
Where do you get out of this?
And if you contest any technical intervention in the "fabrication", you need to call for the prohibition of the PMA for hetherosexual couples, it would be the deserve of coherence.
I am also surprised that the "for all" manner has not yet this logical claim to his attractive catalogue.
It is exactly that it is not the only cathos that manifest: the other religions also, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
This, however, is useful to remember that these different churches have been opposed to all the developments of the society: in 1865 (and I meet G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup, violently insisted on the will of the Gvt to admit the girls to the oil in the name of "Family Defence".
We're always in the same scheme.
And, more recently, the same currents have struck by civilization and family destruction when the oil has become mixed.
That is the credit that we can grant to the positions of these people.
It doesn't need to be catho to injure the marketing of wheat and kids...
All this is in the right line of the deficiency of west civilization, increasingly contested by others!
For me, freedom stops with the other: yes, the homosexual couples who have the right to love themselves as others.
But not tolerance that the child is a mobile object.
And this is also valid for GPA heteros.
I can't just love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had a better ballon control and knew to avoid fucking stupidity moments, he could have been a popular player.
Moreover, I am sure any other attacking, except Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will cumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have marked if he had been given more than 42 choices in national team...
I can't be in agreement, at least not categoryfully:) Since this article speaks of the purposes he has marked, I will not talk about other things he brings, especially to ManUtd (which RvP, Mata, Kagawa don't bring or bring anything), but maybe it would be another reason why he won was much more often chosen than Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12h48 Recommend 119 This is the way to criticize Rooney at this moment so you can forgive that you do it too.
It is good to take into account that since he signed with Manchester City in 2011, Aōro marked 56 targets and made 23 decisive steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney marked 59 goals and made 32 decisive steps in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
Moreover, "Wazza" is rather a good reason to ridicule it.
I'm supposed to ask if you really look at the foot or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve the same choices as Rooney and B) would mark the same purposes if he had so many choices.
I really don't understand where the criticisms come from about Rooney's capacity as footballer.
The most difficult is to be selected regularly in the team of his country for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously compared to Wayne Rooney's football quality (not even attaching) with Peter Crouch's?
Are you doing that without blaming?
There are really people completely at the mass.
You can also note for your government that Rooney has not always been the previous center machine for England during his career in England team.
Instead, he played the previous return, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch that we mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturri.
You must have written this by blaming.
In a country where the airport is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people have a weapon, I find it totally schizophrene and paradoxal as a way to proceed.
And those in this school are not just in line with the employment of weapons in the United States!
the use of the crayon is still suitable.
Stop connery: the girl is five years old.
How many play with facist guns at this age with us?
Is this actually a powerful murderer for so many?
Although the airport is in the American constitution and that it is forcely affecting the country's culture, I don't think that the riches are sensitively different from ours.
A little good sense and reason keeped svp.
It's a disarmament procedure!
Come on, you're sure!
The different information on this fact is insufficient to evaluate whether this little girl really has, or does not have any premies to the go of the morbide.
Can we get out of the principle that a series killer can't have a strange behavior at the age of 5 years?
If people need a psy follower, it's more the mabulans of this school than the shops!
Let parents get their kid out of here: she's in danger!
It's totally agreed.
Those who manage this school are obviously sick.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state of the United States, but it is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
Is Relative Youth?
These blue coasts that men carry nothing of a businessman!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson bring at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar was carrying a long cup of cow and Sir Richard Branson was carrying a pull to roll.
I can't comment too much because I've never seen this, but everything seems so injured and without.
I don't think that's what he wanted to say.
Contrast, maybe?
But how depressive it looks!
You forwarded me.
I would have thought that a greater knowledge of the business would be a lot of business.
I wonder what Mr Bjayou's doing these days.
Perhaps when saying "ostraciser", it would mean "alien".
It would be logical.
No, I thought that was what he could have said, but obstraciser doesn't always have sense.
In the worst, if all candidates were dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar had a green costume, it could be advanced that their intention was to obstraciser.
But here, no.
It seems to have been corrected – strange. Perhaps the whole phrase has been invented!
It's not weird.
Haha, who knows what he could say?
Probably nothing, but someone would absolutely quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was well "ostraciser", which would absolutely not say anything.
The rate of chomage in the United States has still decreased, approximately 6%.
Never seen since 2001.
The prices of the exence are decreased in all States.
The American economy, with Obama, continues to strengthen.
Who's saying better?
You have a very short view...
Their economy becomes "susenable"?
In order to live there at this time, I will say that the United States are a little bit close to the explosion as inequalities become foolish there.
The political system is literally deteriorated by the financing of electoral campaigns.
Racial pressures, police violence, mass incarceration have a wide range that we don't imagine in Europe but Americans keep an incredible optimism in the future of their country and theirs!
How long?
That's the main question.
A few days ago, the financial environments said that France was lost.
Now, it's the America who's at the end of his roll.
Happy, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Includes one of these articles that simply forget the essence.
The US economy consumption level is no longer supportable...
Gifts and billet tables wouldn't know for a long time to give the change...
On the basis of the eradication of earthly resources and growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And forcedly the poorest and poorest, a very large majority of citizens, will "trick" or they'll be mourned.
I can't blame this Farrage.
Is the Labour finally going to understand that its cynic and determined policy to import competitive voters from the foreign causes him to lose more support with him?
I don't think it's a trial.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to promote any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their cold war continued with Russia.
Laboratory shameful performance, Ed Milliband is in the mouse, it is at 617 votes.
About 11% of the Labor – choking, really choking.
Everyone is more or less coherent than the massive immigration policy of the Government of Blair was designed “to feed the right nose in the diversity”
The Labour returns the partial election, the Tories lose the partial election in secure seat against ukip = Crisis Laboratory Did you talk about your fight against reality with a terapeut?
I think that it's the same Multiculturalism that causes this turn of manivel, the pendule has spread very far from the end of the war, and I think it's going to break in the other sense.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a terapeut?
Lol - Safe Site of the Labor, a 617 vote difference.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, everyone who's not in the deni knows.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for the Labour it's a victory at Pyrrhus.
Search the word "Victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used argumentably against the word "defect", it wins the battle!
I agree with Jack, it's a victory, but she's mad.
The Labor should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine they get the majority?
Personally, I am indifferently important that wins in 2015 until the Lib Dems are not there.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, right?
Yes, I know Canada, Greenland and North Russia's ice is hard.
In contrast, I wonder whether the alignment of Venus and March etc should not be considered too?
In general, the earth is more “speakable ” or unleavenable than we imagine.
Is that what?
A few little perplexities.
On the other hand, Wylie tells us about a "softly simple mechanism: with the disappearance of ice that weighs on the earth's crowd, the pressure on the mantle relaxes, which would give/don (a) a footcut to the production of magma (b) while facilitating its access to the surface??
In any case, either the "coat of foot" or the enhancement of the access to the surface is located (may or less).
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the efficacy and inversity About climate heat, but I am able to focus on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, patricedud, does this volcanism not affect our environment?
Does it not affect our climate heating, future or past?
Is Preudence not to reheal anymore?
When complexity is not able to solve by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but, too, when he's night, we see less well.
Good morning, the end of the last iceary period was also accompanied by a stronger sismic activity, especially in the "active" Mountain Chain, where on the very English continental parts Canada, Scandinavia).
Cordialement CB
It is ignored too often that the earthquake floats on the magma and that the only cross of the moon makes it up or down from about 30 to 60 cm, differently, after its pass to zenith, as it does for the ocean waters.
What makes the glamour of the tectonic plates, as well as the married, is more or less easily by this moved box, as far as the pool calotts are allocated by the ice source, which thus causes a change in the equator equivalent of the earth's balances, since the earth's volume remains constant.
I am pleased with this "human", saying the top of the Nature and its self-proclaimed commander, to ridicule by his stupid action on the environment that created it and whom he so separated that has become harmful, and to himself and to this environment.
And all this is to remain the high commander of this nature that exceeds it in the organization of its own victoria, by an invention that consists of finding all the ways possible to dominate his neighbor, one another, moving from the ability, the money.
The earthquake is not based on magma, but on the earthquake, which is constituted of solid rock.
I personally find him impossible to look at.
Arrogant and arrogant.
This reminds me of Ascent of Man de Bronowski.
Living the next part.
Beauty History Wild1
Instead, it reminds me of a totally genius series of 2002 called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Extremly, almost no one remembers it now.
Sorry you never have passed beyond the first impression.
Your loss...
“ The ge’s, our remote forefathers ” You should look at this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Super Thanks Program Brian
I am almost sure that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been performed several times, they are still going to Ethiopia (obviously)
Oh, there I don't support this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes to Ethiopia to claim to make a big eyes in front of a brain in a bocal.
And his narration...
It must be hard for you, obliged to look at Coxy.
Maybe there is a group of support for you, it says.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully filmed.
Is Marcel Gauchet representing a marxist bottle?
Actually, this is the individualist identity which is currently predicted.
It therefore needs to be self, so it doesn't fit.
Certainly, but Descartes is also at the time of the event of individualism, and its intellectual question expresses this progress.
But at that time, these are just the premises that appear, today the individualism structure of the whole society, educationed or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We're good in the "mass" individualism!
Without doing an unusual horizon, there is no parent with the Cartesian approach to examine what we can believe, what we believe ourselves.
More than the rebellion, the doubt is feecond.
Making Fo’ault a revolutionary is an absurdity.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and reclaim them.
His work on psychiatric has produced an anti-reform!
With the problem at the level of his paranoid nominal, he blocked all progress and any reflection on the reality of foolishness.
And brought the most reduced and reactionary vision that supports: behaviorism.
Left has absolute reason for this and to be anticonformist, it is fighting against this disturbance.
We're prosecuted at Marcel Gauchet to be a defensor of the order.
Great idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, ask some...
Blacks and beaches, to others.
Beeps and robots, they understand the most followed of those who seem ridiculous in their mirror.
Thanks in all cases to his responsible polymetics to submit under the fires of the present Marcel Gauchet, this patient and persistent humanist, and so pedagogically lighting.
David Cameron supports the growth of the inheritance tax
How many other budgetary coups will be needed to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave's the robot will increase its net value when it'll be powerful.
Business Councils, accommodations, consultations costs, a series of best-sellers written by a negro on the "serious policy" – it will be 100 £ once the army has passed on the left.
Of course, he doesn't want tax on heritage.
Isn't that the same lie as the last choice?
And the richest are those who certainly pay at least tax on heritage through super-paid accounts and tax evasion programmes.
This has all the signs of a decline Empire where heritage kills innovation.
He'll be worth 100 pounds once he'll have passed the army on the left.
Anything.
It's probably gonna promise to decrease the weight of 1 million £, which is well in the way you say it's worth.
What was your position when the Labour doubled the floor of 650 000 for the couples?
Did you also think Brown thought only to his own inheritants, or are you only a free brain tribalist?
We didn't choose it last time, we had a coalition at the place.
You could not allow you to accuse him to lie only if we had actually chosen him to the power.
Like the rest of us, Dave will not die "normally".
The climate change and the distortion will reduce it, he and the others of his acabit.
His “richness ” will be as useless as the one of others and will not save him nor his children.
A non-impossible income is a social benefit, especially in a country where the government debt has exceeded 1.000 000 000 000 £.
All of us must be imposed to pay essential services and refund the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I don't say that the discipline diplomatic is inutile, of course, I just say that it is insufficient to acquire certain natural "sufficiencies".
Unreasonable declaration for the mathematical professor she was!
Like...
Better recruiting and training teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class does not know any other approach than quantity.
There are two possible answers, the first would be to choose teachers according to their ability to translate knowledge => reforms recruitment methods.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she doesn't know how to act or react to work well => It is reduced to establish a defiance relationship that causes everyone to suffer purely loss => It would need 1 training for skills to teach.
A staff who learns, of course.
But the pedagogy is primarily an art, a natural provision and a vocation before being a technical.
Working on and with human beings is not manufacturing cars.
The pedagogy doesn't equate even when we're mathematical!
"Education Sciences" cannot have a lack of natural skills.
What is currently missing is a real call at the bcp of those who embrace the profession
If the gifts exist, pedagogy (I prefer the discipline) allows those who are less appealing to not make a mistake.
There are ways to address more effective issues.
The real unknown today are the  firs of which 1/3 tells us, that it doesn't serve anything I already know what I think.
A article of Slate describes the chaotic situation of this income.

She ended at 3 hours of the morning from this week, but she started at midnight.
If that seems to be suitable for his time.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It's not right to me!
It's been years ago that his emission starts at midnight.
We have this thing called Iplayer and that allows us to listen to emissions at the request when we want it!
The Internet, it's pretty incredible, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum 4 MB download speed at me, I can't really listen to radio emissions.
I have an usb type adapter behind my SKY box and is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my television seemed too complicated.
Yeah, I think I missed in the hours, I had to hear Richard Lester at about 3 hours.
Although there were men on the day on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in an antenna time when one of the men is in vacation or sick, it would at least please people.
They should start taking away Jeremy Vine.
Its emission is of any sensitive deal in the debate, and it would be better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women daily, where no of the regular animators, of Chris Evans on the morning at Simon May's emission at night at the return of the job, is not a woman
It's five emissions.
So what (of these five) is the most possible to be.
Shennan knows it very well, but he doesn't say anything -- for instant.
Steve Wright is the half-depreciated in this time.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to offices as a true journalist, but the dinner keeps all the ice air of a Daily Mail radio.
I think it's quiet, waiting for the current team to get it off or turn it away.
I was born in Sweden in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal that these people vote to the UN.
Since 40 years, we have the same parts that change to power and make the keys of the country to the other less good than they have taken it.
The campaigns are very poor, just poorer than the campaigns with more isolation.
You have to make miles to find a movie, a bar, a gimnase, a theater.

The United Nations promotes the wildness of hum's beast, culture and ignorance so much as to say that it still has a huge potential growth, they really need to be bad so that they don't have done better...
Today, the United Nations is especially promoting pain, fear of the daily, the other and the feeling of no perspective.
But yes, you're right!
What kind of humanity.
Happy that there is a poor people like you, intelligent, cultivated and humid to save honor.

This is the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen, you can not just "measure and mix", women must be integrated in the development process.
What I want to say is that in many developing countries existing standards are subject to, such as children's care and socio-productive roles.
This allows women to recognize that women can work in the economic area and that is super - it is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double floor, that is, we will expect them to go to work while they continue to fill their socio-productive role.
I'm not sure my sister.
Economy and benefits do not play sex's roles.
The money is talking, and if a sex is not at the height, the next!
The benefits are ridicule from your life.
What are you doing, what is the benefit and what do you have to offer?
The benefits are lost from heroism and education of children.
If it was a crime, enterprises would listen.
Employment friends will never employ women of 20 to 45 years of age.
Well, well said my sister.
It is very difficult that no one speaks of unbalansed social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of non-payed social work (which is the majority of women) must be more than 50% of the BDP.
The unbalanced social work does not receive enough support and is subvalued (without speaking of the fact that men do not enough), but it allows our companies to work and keep our work.
Unpayed social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a real economic emancipation outside the house...
Thank you for all your comments - to return to the point of Mskayadee, how can we take into account the responsibility taken in a way disproportionated by women when we carry out gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he will help many people who have to "cook a house".
The tigre is not Russian is only Western propaganda.
The Chinese are only responsible for the current situation and would better sit at the negotiations table.
The tiger right to self-determination and the Russian soldiers are just running near the border, long-term exercises before the current situation.
Furthermore, the tigre has no air missile in possession.
Free Tigristan!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Soon he came to me the same kind of idea.
Here's a whole pretext found to arm some separatists to join China.
If the Tiger of Siberia is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's only time to repair this disaster.
Why is an article on a magnificent tigre, famous, and real danger of extinction, finally transforming it into a article of beting against Poutine?
What's he doing inside?
This is therefore not a faith in the Tiger of Siberia, but a faith in the follow-ups of a com's operation of Poutine.
When we are exposed to the media, we are also exposed to ironie or even criticism.
Perpetual victimization return of sympathysing so-poutine.
The Holland also had taken the poor with his camel without crying to the French anti-complot.
In our learning Alain Bougrain-Dubourg, the holy protector of the large Russia, was personally involved in the re-introduction of this tigre.
Anyway, the tigre he's all understanding, he's getting...
What Holland's going to get down, it's something.
In the first view, this seemed to be a terriblely consequent idea.
But on the basis of the article, it seems that it is a response to a real problem - the dental subventions - and effective.
So it is difficult to find something to go back.
And if only 53 percent of this sample broke the teeth before, and ≥ per cent after, it's a little empty sense of complaining about the patriarch.
Finally, there is no inconvenience to breathe the teeth!
In fact, the complaints are related to the fact that they are targeted to unemployment and that it confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that happens exactly, then it's not a fairly critical.
Belindadienith, of the Regional Health Committee of Canterbury, said that the Ministry was concerned about the number of dental subventions offered by the Department of Work and Income of the Ministry of Social Development to young unemployment adults.
At a median level, there would be better adjusted means to implement it, I think.
But he looks reasonably well thought.
There's an inconvenience to breathe the teeth.
If you broke them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel bed.
If your teeth breast is old and heavy, it can pick the gentile and cause inflammation.
And I remember an emission on the book Guiness of records where someone tried to broke the teeth as long as possible and the Judges of Guiness at the time made it strongly disappointed to do it because of the harmful effects of a frequency and prolonged brossing of teeth.
'for the first time' - very fun.
It seems to be a experimental conception.
The simple fact of being voluntary for this study will have changed the habits of participants who have considered that the brochure of teeth would be studied.
That is why most of the behavior studies include things such as the double blind, the witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the programme itself.
In assuming that these texts are sent to each youth who understands social advantages, there are two things that distinguish this from the test: 1) These are not volunteers, and 2) they don't give information back on when they broke or broke their teeth (easily broken results by people who give their results according to expectations).
Is there consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) have shown that the maternal environment (including the uterus) will have effect on genetic heritage, not in the genetic, but in the expression of genes, and that these inherited trades will be transferred to the following generation.
The grip of users affects this phenomenon?
The nidation doesn't mean itself to a kind of grip.
There are probably consequences, but until we don't want to be born of a perfect clone of ourselves, is that a problem?
I think it's going beyond the limit of the reasonable.
The desire of maternity and parentality should not move to go far away, without putting the question of ethical, risk, mother and child.
Not the doctor is not all powerful, not it is not unlimited and he is unfortunate and painful to accept that all women will not have the, or the children they want.
This has nothing, absolutely nothing to see with the tran
But let people, women, others, have their body, their sense of love that can go to risk and manage your little witnesses to you alone, all alone in your little bottle to you alone.
of their "confident" this magic sack to have this wonderful time of pregnancy.
Why would I keep it strictly in my strength if he can still give love.
The current strict circumstances make the PR FRYDMAN on its communication, but if "on" agreed to think, "on" would admit that it is only the sack and not the genetic material that is involved.
What's going to wear as an anti argument: cf here these reactions of all men carefully....
Marjane, any gift of organ doesn't have any addiction.
I've been plasma giving for years, it's not totally anonymous.
I was registered as a donor of pine mole (I have never been selected because the selection is very strict and it understands both for the recipient and for the donor), it is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not allow to judge in a sense or in another or to participate in this gift, but I will listen to women talking about it.
@Margane: actually, it has nothing of ananodin, and it strengthens the love act that it involves.
Giving a rein to a member of his family who needs it has nothing to do with ananodin, and it is done!
Please, don't have a combination of Messi v Ronaldo.
It's low.
I'm okay, we don't need that.
Especially if there is no competition anymore...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
The sport has become a yoio club.
They're too good for the Second, but they don't have the Liga standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winner team of the title.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Sports before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to keep all the Real Madrid target records this season to be able to return to Old Trafford this summer with quiet consciousness...
I'm worse to believe it.
I think Ronaldo will end his career at Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the International Oil Investment Society?
I was looking at a fucking connection so I can't tell you much if it's not that Valencia had well defended and without counting the property, they deserved to win.

Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me read a few times ago that a black child mammy had been discovered in the current Libya and that this covered had opened new horizons, including geographical and timely (I believe I remember that the movie was over 1000 years ago in the first known African mamies).
Do you have information about this?
Thank you for advanced.
She's a little kidnapped with reading.
This may not be modern contamination.
Wasn't the wilderness at the time less far than now?
Why don't you imagine plants like cannabis to the place where there is only sand now?
We knew the song.
And it suffices that a scientist of Europe, even without any evidence, confirms that it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and therefore the Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything.
But the song doesn't tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it is not and always "of his foreheads wrong with".
You should read the article.
This is an article published by neoliberal quacks of the free market, which preachs against the mobility of people and the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people reached by Ebola and about whom the Spanish Government lies to us, so that they don't give themselves a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But it might be that they stay silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same in tourism, but the rights governments (cf. Spain and the United Kingdom) have tend to protect the interests of enterprises rather than those of people.
Stop calling your local MP and complaining about the lack of transparency.
Although I think that the government here is only a band of shirts, good to nothing and corrupt, as Madrid is not a very tourist place, I doubt that it is their biggest concern.
What's wrong with you?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the infirmary and its own) because tourism is one of the only things that allow millions of people in this country to keep the head out of water, I would say that it is important.
If they are absolutely rapped with the missionaries, I don't see why they couldn't have sent them to a air military basis and healed them there in a landhotel, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had a mission to dismantle the Spanish health service, privately nationalized hospitals in Madrid, which is its power basis, until the courts arrive.
It's nothing but a right enjoyer for relations like Cameron, and as Cameron, I think it's crazy to the next elections.
To be right toward Cameron (I know that it is not easy here) socially he is far from his right and would find his place to the religious fools of right in America.
Now he has to sing the praise of the hospitals he had already gone down to try to achieve his goal that is to protect the Spanish tourism.
I am sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other European part of right to the Spanish right.
These are cases other than me.
The Spanish Government lies about almost all about it.
It's not like someone could accuse you to spread infunded sounds.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called The comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting the work in the centre of production and economy with its rights and guarantees, it will not be done.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions on the forum .
Many TPE - SME patrons read the World to take time to condemn the words of Pr.
Let's go to the anti-intelectualism of the era of ambition.
A jurisprudence teacher at the College of France cannot know the work market unless it is Nobel economy price and proposes to liberalize it completely
It was so better before, it was true when Dr. Villermé found the work of the children of 8 a.m. in 10 a.m., when the Canuts were taking place because of a collective convention signed.
Oh, good old time...
Your reaction is also fascinating by your ignorance of the TPE patron office!
Its office is not to know the right in all its households, but to manage and produce.
Four manuscripts recorded on my salary bulletin of my youth, more than 100 information today!
This is an example that we can cite much more, which illustrates the continuous flow of restrictions, imposed without measurement of consequences, and that enhance the small company.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as a expert and not as a Surbon client.
In order to disturb the argument of the French Working Code's Breaker in relation to the Helveth, a serious university would have been stuck in the Swiss texts and would have compared the number of of official texts and then the comments (without the absence of these can mean that Swiss laws are more comprehensible than ours).
By comments in a Code, whether or not, the jurisprudence is intended in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is charged to apply the laws when a salary is licensed, for example....
Who's complicated?
Do you think the rules of law (law, jurisprudence, conventions, contracts) are related to work and trade of unsupportable obstacles?

For each article on Ai Weiwei I have recently read, you are part of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Go on to another thing!
Let's see elsewhere, the choice doesn't miss in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists who are not passwords of the party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a Chinese government troll.
I think China has produced a lot of good modern artists.
Those who are port-passwords of the government are not appreciated in Oë, and those who are not-passwords are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think the art of Ai Weiwei is a kind of fraud, this is what you rat.
Thanks for this, you just destroyed my little dinner.
I'm sorry, but you needed to exhibit it at all (not doing a bad word game).
It's the guy who's scattering the old cheramics and calling it the art, isn't it?
There's art, and then there's vandalism seeking to draw attention.
True artists make the difference.

KARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is indispensable to carry out an electoral mandate for the extremists of any board (including sionists) must be put to art.
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous theories of the complot, who have been worthy of several judgments, make Israel and Neilly's Majority shame.
He doesn't represent each other.
Philippe Karsenty is fighting the truth alone, in marginal.
WHAT SIGHT
What does the Neilly Marie against Philipe Karsenty, who is angry with a journalist and his family, and who calls to attack this urbanist?
Criminal claims?
I don't find Neuilly on my map?
Is there a new administration that has these new privileges?
This type needs care, in the same title as Ulcan Che日, they both do in the theory of the anti-Jewish complot and whose towns are perfectly identical to those of their wrathest detractors.
In the same term as many people believe in any political decision to see the hand of the "sionists" (the term of which the meaning has tend to disappear, because of its abuse), these two, in the same title as the J or even the CRIF, believe in any critical, even banal, an object antisemitism "which is not without reminding the darkest hours of our history, because it is still feecond the beast of my good lady we would believe in Russia of the 19th century!"
Note that Karsenty's stupid theories on the reporting of Charles Enderlin are still stupider than those on September 11th.
And God knows that the theories of the complot on September 11 are of a crazy devil.
And this type has political responsibilities, it's extremely concerned.
To determine my analogy with the theory of the complot of 11 September, cognitive dissonsion is discussed about how to address the subject.
Completely blind by a completely fashioned truth, having spent too much time, spent too much money to spend this, it is insufficient to adopt this theory to distract it (as in case of extreme religious).
Initially, a logical and inevitable fleeing forward, the end justifies all means, even lies, which is a complication, but it does not seem to disturb the mission of the concerned.
You advise to take attention and not put everybody in the same painter, but that's what you're doing for September 11.
There is still a flood of questions without answers for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudians/Consorts are not pressed to answer it.
In fact, there are very fair theories, but the official theory is, at least on some points.
Oh, nothing's fun now...
Health NGOs and health portfolio find that the results of the study are largely in favour of their efforts to improve.
And, of course, they will need more subventions to follow!!
Like the fact of smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized that what it is actually, alcohol will also know his time of judgment where the real damage that it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to be pleased to say things like "alcohol consumption is growing", but what requires (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
Sorry if you consider this an attack - you're going to drink a drink and you're detaining?
It is better to risk this than to put my mental health in danger by abstaining me.
The Government ends the pleasures when it costs him money.
Here are other alarming advice based on unreliable statistics.
Two average glasses per day are at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quotation ○ indicates that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second point is that it is more or less dangerous.
It may be that the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should agree (about one or two glasses, but especially not three) and give us a number that they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now, we're going to take them back, like smokers!
They're already doing it - soon it'll be grass!
My father wasn't drinking and smoking, and cancer took him 64 years old.
So I'll continue to drink my two red bottles on Friday and Saturday evening (and the other night when my wife is not there).
Why the Cancer Council encourages children to go to the sites where alcohol is used This is an old presentation that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not linked to a risk of cancer today?
The rains don't get cancer - they eat anything but they're not a good company.
Rears can catch the cancer of the skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence is a subject recurring for many years.

Completely agreed.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing.
To them two, they destroyed us F1 under security pretext.
Let's hope that it's better than Schumi or at least worse Wendlinger's accident in 1994.
Absolutely agreed with you, but attention to point 1 is not the F1, but the incidences of the circuit that have made progress in the outcome so that they don't loud the TV broadcasts.
Exactly, +1
I just want a quick and quick restoration to Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the incidents that failed to occur between deficiencies and f1 were unexpected warnings.
We knew that one day this would happen, and Jacques Laffite, especially, said it for years.
How the currency organization and the FIA could have allowed these manuscripts without getting out of security car?
I can't accept that the risks of the officer or the failure of chance are called on when the prejudice has not been prevented.
Or that accident was it.
Although it is also necessary to say that there was a yellow flag, which does not only mean "prohibition to overcome in the area" but is for the first time aimed at signaling a danger.
It's not shameful, it's lucky for the family to be in front of the television.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just rise up.
In changed conditions, the virage can be much more nice to the following tour and the pilot, thinking to come with enough margin, even to have a "reduced" speed compared to a normal rythme.
But well, we're causing the empty there, until we have not seen the images, we're not able to make an opinion.
I don't see too much what this changes.
Is there some wounds?
According to the CBC, no hurt has been reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before this happens, which makes me wonder what caused the deal.
It is difficult to believe that there are still jobs where we must be guarding 24 hours at 24 hours.
I don't think there are vulnerable people because Canada is almost empty.
Perhaps there are hurt animals like wears, lavator ratons, etc.
I hope it's ironic.
Some parts of Vancouver have the strongest population densities in North America and Toronto's agglomeration account for at least six million residents.
In the Saskatchewan campaign, trains don't drive as anxiety and these types of trains often crossout town areas.
Almost every Canadian city is passed through a railway line, and trains are very, very often in one day.
Moreover, as the roads often follow water courses in the regions where there are lakes, oceans, or oceans, they also pass in densityly small places, because people always want to live near the water.
Thus, all the rail traffic passed through the center of a city because there was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be fun, but there is a huge potential for railway disasters in Canada.
Mansbri's made a report on this last night, really shocking.
Did you obviously not read the article on the rail and explosion of a train in a city of Quebec who made 47 dead?
In fact, you're partly right.
The town of Vancouver was a port city well before the railway.
This means, when the railways were built, they passed through the center of the communities established because it was the most direct and central road.
Canadian railway staff may have to go to the next Conference on dangerous products in Calgary in Canada on 2 and 3 December 2014.
CN employees are long-formed for the transport of dangerous products.
This article as many comments makes the impression on the primary religious question: a religion is a reveled truth and for his believers he could not exist other truths.
The whole problem is there, and the exhesions of the teologists only strengthen this fact, but what is good to talk about the sex of angels?
"God said, that's good - that's bad" > it is not compatible with democracy, it is called dictature (theocraty).
The word of a leader (musulman country but not important): "Not without religion, how do you want to keep the people?" .
In other words: Obedience to the chief priest Rabbin have and make your prayers, it will be better!

Yes, that's what they thought Voltaria and others, so Robespierre in a certain way trying to establish a worship of the Supreme Eter.
But our oligarchia also has its worship: the one of the strong Euro ( rather than at this time ) or the one of the free market ( supported by the State when it is necessary to flow ) , etc .
Great ideas issued from religious events.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational arises, the religious is at the remorque and is expressed in the skism.
The religion is born as a ideological support of the State, and the gods who serve ambitions even if it has also brought forms of contest.
The teologies between faithfulness in the form of revelation and adaptation to the air of the time did not know the doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a bad interpretation of "heirate texts".
It does not resist the examining of these texts that are used as an appesl explicit to the hatred of the unbeliever.
Instead, they are moderate religious (and happily they are the most) who "read evil" the texts and keep them only from humanism and common values to humanity, attitudes and believers.
For me, fanatism is the use of animal and wicked passages of holy texts out of their context.
Thus, some verses of the Coran calling for murder of "believers", "infidels", "hypocrites", "Judas" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore inappropriate if there are no higher or lower verses that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in defense situation.
on Yves Petit: "on the "fulard", it is well a religious prescription that makes it almost unnimous today among the "savants".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to deal with this is that it has caused a general condemnation.

If you discover your television eyes during an instinct, you will see that Australia has a rich cultural inheritance, starting with paintings in grotes and on stones made by its indigenous people and who are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is Sydney's Opera and a national opera company that produced wonderful songs such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
The Australian film produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
The notable ones include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.

And I say that as a Roman citizen.
From Transylvania, with a Hungarian woman of origin, contrary.
I can't support the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the local authorities who has not stopped denegar the Roman football to the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the Operative, which decided before the beginning of the season which team would take the championnate, which teams would go in Europe, which would be released, and which was white for money, mainly by selling players who were well-evaluated.
Gica Popescu, the ancient Captain of Barcelona, did business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (approximately a million euros), then paid them, but, apparently, he was wrongly advised by his lawyers, admitted his errors to the court (which would have been worthy of an unfortunate condemnation) and therefore took 3 years and half of prison.
The trial also valued the prison to the brothers Becali, four owners of the club, the Steua Mihai Stoica manager, and Popescu for crimes in connection with the football.
George Becali also cleansed a penalty for trying to sudower (and then dissimulated the facts) a team for it to us (CFR Cluj) in the last match of the championnat, to be able to win the title and get the jackpot of the League of Campions.
The team he tried to sudower was our neighbors of Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be the first campions of Cluj, while they were released.
I'm always getting so hot at this time.
In the dissimulation of this corruption attempt, Piturca, which signed as a witness to a false document that suggested that the money that the police had confiscated in Cluj was related to a land sale.
So this poor man's not educated, idiot, trigger and lying doesn't represent me, and he'll never do it.

I hope that in the foolish, fiscal pool, it will also generalize the absolute control of the gugnafiers commonly called plumbcrates, banksters, kleptocrats, tax evasives, furniture patrons, and other malandrins.
You know doing a phrase without the banksters or pluttery words?
You look very proud of your jargon every time.
That's true when we've got the class: we're treating the population of ice and without teeth.
At each new unemployment period, I address tenths and tenths of candidates to employees who are most often not even in charge of a receipt accused.
This is also the total absence of monitoring or support from the Pole Employ.

A worker can remain several months without news of his agency, but he must continue searching for jobs by its own means.
Controls have been allowed to radiate people who for more than half did not touch unemployment allocation.
So we wonder how people can be controlled that we never see.
We wonder what sanctions represent a radiation for someone who does not have access to employment services or unemployment allocations.
And if we can admit that this reform will allow more radiation, we ask ourselves how it will help recruitment.
"The unemployed one can stay a few months without news of his agency, but he must continue to seek jobs by its own means" It is truly shameful.
Why are these countries in the EU, while the authorities are unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
Isn't that as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done greatly about racism in the foot as well?
Should we throw them out of the EU?
The EU was only economically originating and should remain.
The purpose is not to be a "the police of thoughts".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It doesn't have any sense on a economic plan.
This is probably why Great Britain will soon leave the EU: this is the most inequality society in Europe.
What equality?
Eastern Europe's teams are continuing to have by corrupt mafia arbitrs that are the EUFA.
The best solution would be that all the East would leave this lucrative organization and create her.
At least we'll finally look at football.
This antiracism crossade is only a `ran to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
The currency and trade, rather.
The European Equality ideals?
So what the hell is Europe to let the United Kingdom enter?
Uefa should applaud them for having enjoyed Blatter's commodity and his men.
That's happening everywhere for a few years, and I'm not exhausting.
From Gardian there are two or three days ago:
Should he hope to see a small symmetrical phrase, just a story of holding the polymetic?
Anyway, it is a fact that at every small event to peace there is, there is, and there will be people who are working to cast oil on fire.
The decade would be to say that the Otàl States are against a "Palestinian state" that they are pro-Israelian and that it only explains that these States have never done anything against the State of Israel.
The decade would mean that in order to resolve the Israel-Palestinian question, it would be necessary to act against the armed Israeli identity state occupying the destruction of a colonising oppressor
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine in the detriment of a Arab population that was not for anything in the Shoah, it was more reasonable to empty the Bavier of its German residents (which they were guilty of Shoah) to replace them by the Jews on-shoah.
It would have been justice, the Germans had nothing to claim, and Europe would have kept millions of educational, undertaken and dynamic residents.
Mr., let's take the example of Sahara O'al colonization...
It's evidence that Marokko is the colonialist!
But as for Israel, it is also necessary to ask the history, its allies and its support to learn the truth.
The colonialism, whether or not, has never been altruist, we agree.
Then stop your piroutes to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaule has been colonized by the Romans, but now there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gaulois or others.
In Palestine there is a discrimination depending on origins.
Moreover, the Israeli state is defined as the one of a "Jewish people" whose non-Jewish people will not be able to be part.
The Israeli state says the non-Jewish, from which the pleasant is.
Conclusion: In order to solve the conflict, sionism must be broken against Jews and not Jews.
In Maghreb, some people were even baptized by the name of their first status by this salvation civilisation!
Two realities we need to stop ignoring.
Primo, the European sionist project (colonising the Palestinian) was to depose the Palestinians, so it was an intrinsic anti-Palestinian project, so the solution needed to break with sionism.
Second, sionism is a political ideaology.
Uruguay was missing death from the way.
Their tiny outcome will give them what the fingers are moving.
He should start his rehabilitation by small bottles.
I hope he didn't lose the appetite of the game.
So much tolerances, including racial damage and hard tacles in the football, have been sanctified too hard.
I'd like to see him returning to literature, no matter what the purists say.
Yeah, I hate all these molars.
Football is a contact sport where the locks exist, and therefore, the players will hurt themselves.
The fact of returning his teeth into the body of an opposer to have the benefit does not have his place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for making a similar gesture.
Now it's the third time Suarez's doing this.
If you shoot someone at work.
What would be the consequences of you?
I knew someone was going to shoot.
If you're dyslexic, I'll forgive you.
I'm actually dyslexic.
I'm forgiving this sarcasm with two balls.
I guess he was quick to go back to play full teeth.
All these words games on Suarez are losing their death.
I didn't hurt the hammement.
An essential condition for a good school partner is the respect of their teachers and school institutions.
This works if parents increasing this respect for their children.
Parents make this easier if they also feel respected by their children's professors and children.
In good institutions those who make their students progress are considered as partners, not as emms.
Who can believe that it is the Professor who should do all the work (learning, educating, respect, limiting, living shortly) It is for parents to make at least 50% of the taff.
But it's probably more simple to take it into the oil.
It is not operational to put on parents.
No one really took them.
The action will therefore remain limited.
In contrast, the school institution could have many things.
Operating solutions are resident.
Actors (professors, hierarchies and ministers) should be playing their role in it, and they should not be permanently touched.
We can solve a troop that gets broken to restore it, not the family.
How not talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow change.
We look like training teachers, but we forget the first role of the olive.
Transfer Knowledge.
And if there is a need for parents, it is that the oil provides their children's instruction.
What is the Minister who will call what the Public Instruction was called.
Deceiving article: few information, partial and destructive reflections.
Are you really waiting for a smart comment of this beef of the East areas?
It's a drunk, it's, but I think it's instead of Willoughby, and so from North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He's accepting the facts.
It's not surprising that we have a budgetary emergency.
Let him fall and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
squarely true
That's it.
A little of Aloysius.
His electorate is the seat of Sydney North.
Actually a babe from the North Coast !!!!
Well, if British BBC televisors want to compare the neoconservator governments of our two countries, they would obviously conclude that both are conducted by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers.
It's going for a brilliant, today. :(
Yes, but the good leader leaves it regularly on his hunger.
Instead, you would be awesome too if you were awakening a morning and realizing that you would never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these legal and illegal benefits of life will remain forever out of your portfolio.
Sure, Joe.
Very patetic.
He tried to present a budget half and then abandoned it.
At least he doesn't threaten to persecute someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
It will be able to command it, without gas turbines - in a remote country and call for State assistance.
And as she knows to do lobbying, no fear of the result.
And so nice for employment in France that she has nothing to do, she is always ready to break when their corporation has losses on the markets, especially outside...
It's just because their lobbying did not work only the command was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the time or amendment for marpol, it would certainly have been done.
To learn if it's good or not and how BF will comply with the law despite all, it'd be pretty that "the world" is stuck over!
The Brittany Ferries company is arrested by the British Omer.
Those who burn the tax and duty centres.
They want State assistance.
That they didn't owe me that for at least normal.
Well, in the case the army of a ship under the French Metropolitan pavilion is 30% more dear than any other civilised pavilion, yes, it is normal to wait for a powder of the State.
Or then we are condemned to be tolerated that British people monopolize the market.
It's in the choice.
Eternal French problem that views its maritime fascinations as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where sometimes people live different from the average Parisian.
This difference is payable every day, there is no investment, every short demand.
One of the reasons for which Bretagne must find its sovereignty.
That's what and then they'll create the British pavilion with teams composed of pure britains.
With that, they're sure they're going to reduce the costs significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that's what we have done from the BBC now.
They always hated everything that was related to the progress, so it is not surprising that they chose to pass over Hackett's sole career, which has always been closer to the spirit of Genesis in the 70s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for ○/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was for the sound, you don't really understand their music.
To say the truth, they are almost not mentioning Gabriel’s only work.
I don't think that the BBC can be accused of "hate all that is related to the prog" because they have recently distributed a documentary of one hour and a half on one of the largest prog groups that have never existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a movie about the Genesis Group, not about sole projects of its members.
As regards Hackett's sole career that would be "nearer than the spirit of Genesis of the 70s", I am not agreed.
Hackett has no longer the right to take the road, play a lot of songs of Genesis on which he had different degrees of participation and claims to have a finity with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to raise a half-finished demo and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett doesn't ask anything more than just a representation, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, the first solo album of Bank, is absolutely genius, and in the mind of Genesis in the 70s.
They passed beyond Hackett's sole career because, honestly, she's afraid.
Yes, it is one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been performed if they did not have their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I haven't always seen the BBC spread a long documentary on groups such as King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have a very interesting story but missing the popular attraction as Genesis a.
Good comments.
I would like to say that the BBC has always hated the fact that it ADRAHs progressive music in time.
A person with personal interest cries "prejudiced": of course.
A little more of the interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Absolutely wonderful song.
If death penalty is an attempt to double a terrible act by another terrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is an exciting success.
There will always be a difference of size between a condemned death and those who kill him.
He has committed his action since his fake understanding of the society and its rules.
Those who kill him have done it from the most fair and wise vision and reflection of a society.
I mean, they don't have any excuse.
They're undefensive.
Yes, we had your view, for the first time.
That is exactly where the Difference is held, Mr LeClos.
You must have a well-like mind from the community of mortals to enjoy violence.
That's what the œel's doing since his fake understanding of things.
But this is also what causes pain, hatred, victory among the neighbors of the innocent victim: a false understanding which will never be able to prevail those who are wisely determining the death of others from the healthy and just reasoning of their pedestal.
But to try to equilibrate the analysis, it could also be worth that the conviction to death often has exercised a wild violence, which he could enjoy, against extremely loving people, who have made the costs free.
The neighbors of these unfortunate victims will probably see their pain disappointed with the disappearance of the one who was the bourreal, sometimes the torsionary, to be loving him and who hates their nights.
Let's not disappoint them.
Thanks for this thinking I find very fair.
It's a strong and emotional article.
As regards Mark Asnin, he shows greatness.
The heart cell.
It's certainly what I've read more just for a long time.
However, it would be believed to read stories of another time, ancient things, which the barbary of the past would excuse, and then there are the dates that claim, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is so great.
Similarly, for the other two “Excellent Romanciers Americans” quoted here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all surfaced.
I thought you stopped the white, man.
What's going on?
Roth is great, better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is incommensurous. Better than that penitent Bellow, who received his price.
Perhaps the Nobel judges of this year have decided that if we have to have an American laurate, we could have a [legal] racist.
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce "geni romans" as if it was a literary type.
His homonym Joseph against...
Who did you read?
How many books of DeLillo anti-Delillo have they read?
I never ended underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Did you read The Body Artist?
News like "Home Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first more foolish Romans, more foolish, smaller, and their dialogues, are also great.
I don't know if I'm gonna end a day underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who wants to live in the same world as me and have read enough books from DeLillo to reject his talent of ↓ain, I can only fear that his preferred romance is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict...?
It's a simple interest.
It was a treaty of humor, "law", not a claim of definition.
In the meaning of the text and the mind, it is so EVIDENT that the lady acted only in its interest, and absolutely not in the institution that it represented, that it is asking you what the term “conflict ” is doing there.
For her there was no conflict.
I hope she'll be very dear.
Yes, the state's services are very practical: whether they prevent a dynamic undertaking from creating a value, or they have not warned it of the danger.
After we hear that the French salaries are not dynamic and are only seeking peace.
The inhabitable areas that become constructive from day to day on the next day when a large building program will start it is classic, not only on a low coast.
Look at the holiday planes near the floor.
We have been told that “in our day there are no more intentions through regulations”.
Now, we need to increase the lakes of holding up and cross the fingers.
But it will be because of the state's services, of course...
The benefits on the ground, on the promotion?
By terrain.
So 6 million euros.
Is he more interested there?
Exit the calculator and you'll dream to the life you could have in place of Mrs Babin, the first UMP adjoiner of La Faute on Sea and the former president of the Urbanism Commission, which grants the permissions to build!
The two mothers of Sarkozysme triomphant are the old and the real estate.
I'm from the left and not of all sympathy with Sarko, but svp, not political low or low-political coups of all azimuts, we're not in there in a battle of potential bottles.
I wonder if the flics that are involved in these recent fusillads were also involved in these incidents.
The United States Flicks are endured.
The U.S.'s a fucking shit.
So what the fuck are you living in?
The United States isn't a fucking shit.
Yes, the American flics are endured because of the ra's to which they have worked daily.
Of course, no one of them does nothing but the flicks “come to swallow them because they are racistic. ”
Here's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic in the United States, unfortunately it fails a incident like that to force people to see the problem closer.
Your generalization shows a deep ignorance of the US...
You don't know him here.
Good flicks must denote corrupt racist flicks.
Sell them!
Make the calculation.
That kind of open racism doesn't exist here.
Is this the first time you participate in a conversation?
This is not a conversation, you accuse someone to be ignorant, while you are actually not driving anything - many sources (American resources) have noticed the everlasting problem that is racism in the United States (not western speculation).
It is strong that you subestimate the extension of the problem and do not appreciate how much pressure is on this point.
Therefore, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very strong, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances NYPD in various ways, where the treatment is taken by Occupy there.
What surprises me is the naivity of some and chokes me about the fake VA naivity and others.
And where do you think the research journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to ask the responsibility, they're making them talk, and they're going to be confident.
Let's go to Elisea, it really doesn't have a surprise.
Then, what is accounting is collection, verification, analysis.
And there we understand that the sarcolades have anxiety to do.
@Munstead, our current president has chosen on an antisarkozyism vague based on businesses from any pieces (one no place and no conviction) which have been concocted by judges(2 returned in correction), two friends of Holland.
If this disappointment is revealed between justice, political, exertive and the pressure that is not supposed to be a body of power, it is that your partisan mind is blind!
RV with Holland...
And, of course, all this is only coincidence and not teleguided !! ...
If you think only Sarkozy's support is indignant!
From the extent I could read, the VA article only causes the arroser to be dropped.
I even laughed so much that was big.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chances to abuse because journalists are not "astreinted" in the secret of the sources, right?
In the difference that there is no consciousness between the VA and the power while there is a conviction between the power and the World journalists for a operation against an opposer.
I must not be the only one to wait for a world's interpretation on the ground and on its dangerous relations.
We are well in front of a state scandale that would in any other democracy cause the fall of the involved government.
From which this editorial to abode, which has long said about complication with the current government.
It's not a question of left or right, it's more serious.
I would have thought the eye would go well with the smoke hareng!
It's just for the numbers and to reduce the salaries and create housing problems, I'm sure if I was an immigrator of the second generation whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts on the issue of immigration, but this is not a reason to resist controls.
One of the most sensitive persons in a BBC's emissions on immigration was a Sikh of the second generation that said she was at the same time with the number of people who entered and the changes that they had brought with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not all-cooperating, even giving suppy shoes just because of the lady's religion, he also kept to enter her place of worship while she said that he was not obligated to pray.
** "which said that it was not PAS"
As we all know, if we let it be done, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - whoever imposes limits and contests it must be admired even if it is a public director:) It is better for you!
More to the right?
Where are you living?
If this country was more left, it would be awesome.
You think what did the New Labour which was especially left?
The liberalisation of a country, the NHS, this NHS is repeatedly, the massive immigration of immigrants (only their own terms for good feeding the nose of the right within), the culture of social advantages, the age of all-easy, the right politically killing the freedom of expression.
I understand that the Labour is a center of the left and not aste, I said it to blame, what I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependents of the State.
It's typical to the left, if you want my opinion.
Let your ready arguments as much as you want, but what I asked you is exact examples of left politics, or a link program defensed by the Government of New Labour.
Can you do that?
With all my respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what the New Labour had done to her that was particularly right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you accepted it and changed what you asked.
Yes, it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising director of the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents with the economic migrants coming in Great Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He had a complete reason to do it.
France to French!
We've been in 40 45 to fall in another distraction, the money.
We'll make beautiful economics by seeing these technocrates...
It should be re negotiated with the treaties.
Or, renewments, and if the word "democracy" is more meaningful in Europe, what should it do?
Interestingly, the committee is not concerned about the disloyal tax competition between countries in relation to companies.
This must be a negative quantity.
Europe is not the solution, it's the problem...
The EU has only one objective, it is to make the rail transport sector completely good.
In terms of this, it means that the whole of the French territory of bread will no longer be served by the rail.
The abandon of many territories already victims will only strengthen themselves.
All sacrifices, including the adventure of a country, in the name of the liberal doxa, don't seem to me a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will be able to deal well on one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to set up the accounts of the SNCF.
The French state has been released for a long time.
The regions have the impression to pay for nothing, but not the way to force the sf to respect its commitments.
Or use of public money without gaping is essential today where resources are limited.
And the great needs.
I don't see very well what the TER competition could be!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If that's true, shouldn't he be a loving leader?
It is me that you haven't really been able to distinguish the problems that existed during the marriage and that, of course, you're always coming to the end of pain and anger now more than five years have passed.
Obviously, having an ex-alcool that lives so close to you and having a daily impact on your life is cruel and very difficult.
In fact, I feel sensitive to start the separating process between your life and the complications you have inherited.
It seems to be what they're doing, but it seems an enemy to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and that complications are possible to continue while news make surface, are you thinking of a "fly" plan so that you can break between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a negative effect, but with a competitive immobilial credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be solved.
He looks competitive and persistent.
Why not go to a family advisory group to say things openly and to give him support to help him renew the work and pay food pension.
I think that's the key.
Your life is done much more than the time you've passed with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it involves meet the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choices whatever it is.
Warn them that he will not necessarily keep his promises regarding the contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they will handle the deception if he does not keep his meetings.
Try to keep a contact with their father.
If they see that you do this for their goods, despite your own feeling for the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never stop love you and if you do everything you can to easily make a father/child continued relationship, they will know who thanks when they will be bigger.
I believe that children are finished by understanding who is fair if we let them see things by themselves.
Go a little effort you're close to Godwin point.
In 30 to 40 years, civilization will be disappeared, the short-term economic interests are too powerful, it is the earthquake against iron powder.
Moreover, with globalization, the country that does at least social, fiscal, but also environmental has a competitive advantage, and others are required to follow.
All that policies seek is growth, the Crossance.
It would have to have a international term, but from here...
This is not the climate-sectics produced from C02.
These are all those who hit themselves, those who use the climate, those who take the air or car, those who live in apartments that you have to build, those who buy industrial products that you have to produce and transport.
These are not the climate-sectics that have manifested against the ́otax, but the trucks.
No climate policy is not and Arnold S consumes much more than me.
But nobody says that climate is more than CO2 than others.
Environment defenders also move for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not be sufficient.
Political actions are also needed (other energy sources, reduction of dependence on cars, etc.).
And politicians act in part according to their electorate's identities.
"I'll be back" is actually a famous promise of McArtur made on 11 March 1942 at his department is Philippines.

I'm putting the fault on the crap that took all the money.
Are we counting Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'll call my $5.

Don't use the immigration word, you'll be afraid of the horse!
The United Kingdom depends on the immigration to pay all our retirements, to take care of our old, to clean their hygiene basins, to bury the 30 000 people who die every year of hypothermia or hunger, (forget your lake and goodness, which allow you to reheat, remove the heating AND eat this sandwich at the wheat).
Don't be like that.
The non-controlled and tested immigration will bring Ebola into Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a blame, or is it not exhausted?
It's more comfortable...
This is how the public money is gambled to enable an inseparated minority to pass a good time in the space to make captains and to round all by playing clowns before the TV cameras.
Thus, the reality has not invented anything, and the authorities are sure expecting a child to be designed there to burn the world and to break the median coverage of the west royalties used to tabloids' mothers.
Maybe they should go back on the ground to find that we're driving here!
In contrast to what you believe, we are not sending men or women into the space to make gallpets or clowns, but to work.
And these jobs are very useful for mankind in general.
And this, in all areas.
Many things that improve our day are issued from space research.
So yes, it's the money costed usefully.
You can quote one thing that improves our daily and out of space research.

Shortly, working for work doesn't mean anything and represents even vacuum.
Oh, if the last played high tech.
There are decades of thousands of others who work to what it is possible behind the infim minority of individuals who go into the space.
You know, people who buy anything, including more and more private businesses, especially to get the charge to the station.
If you think you're buying a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't think to buy plastic gun now but who have the potential to buy it in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a corruption in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to mistreat people to make them believe that it is a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch corruptions, but nothing else.
A very unreasonable article, it would have done bad to the author/editor than to put a photo of the "sword" in question instead of generic photos of "swords in plastic"?
Or even to be quite interesting to ask yourself what the inscription would mean (if appropriate) that was above?
Wrong typical reporting, we are concerned about the fact that "This is only a plastic sword" and not the inspiring jiadi text that is written above.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of the shiite Islam.
Dirani's family, however, is a shit muslim, born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups who are trying to cause governments to fall, and in Iraq are almost solar muslims.
If only people would stop dealing with the fact that plastic cows are inoffensif.
In skillful hands, they may be mortal.
Even the small coverages given in the fast residues can perish the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it is a common discourative object, it justifies the ridicule that the author gives him.
It is not the penalty of trying to make a "ha, ha, a plastic sword", the facts like you said are actually supporting his argument.
At the moment, I saw these discorative objects in Muslim houses, or painting on the walls, they never seemed threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Jesus, you're right.
And that takes all its sense now...
I saw that guy looking like to be from the Middle East at Kebab Stop and distributing plastic cottons to anybody all night!
I love the conclusion very much.
All wonderful newnesses often give many people to think that it is a right and need to benefit them, but they have an immediate and worst cost, a fixed cost (abbonment, electricity consumption) which are lost in the budgets.
And the impossibleness of enjoying new sources of frustration.
For example, call the ́te Energy Solidarity, which allows you to isolate the combs of a house for a symbolic € 1 when it is habited by a modesty household (the costs of travel are actually supported by the energy providers!).
Simplely effective but unknown even if more than 3000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interesting this PES.
But I never heard it.
Who can call it, and how does that work?
for information about 60 million consumers, testing water economy douches and preconceiving the position of water economy on robinets and WCs.
The study shows that a family of 4 persons can reduce its water factory by 30% ( 150 m3/year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of water economy per year, while keeping the same comfort.
This is not a crisis of the application, it is a crisis of the system that is not more to produce enough (which would then have been re-distributed in the form of real income growth) in order to pay the increase in the expenditure you classifies in the category “restricted expenditure”.
In other words, energy preservation is "just" the turn of the medal because the economy doesn't get to grow as quickly as it would.
Note that the theory (neo-) classic of the economy is fully impossible to answer such a question, because there is no internal limit to economic growth, and there is no element that may be restricted, more strongly decades after decades, the economic growth rythm.
From its own definition, energy is that allows any transformation.
Since producing, in fact, is transformation, energy is enabled to achieve the smaller economic production (good or service).
And more we want to produce, more we need energy.
This means that any restriction to the increase in energy gain (indirectly called “energy production”), even in the form of an increase in its price, to increase its production (except to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency still require heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not pretty decent).
Shortly, there is a very strong link between energy preservation and the fact that, or not, it is to increase the "production" of unfair energy.
And data very officially contained, for example, by the International Energy Agency, show that the situation will be able to go only in the future years and decades (the AIE, in these recent reports, indicates that the oil production of oil was reached in 2008, understanding, not dear.
Or oil is the most universal energy form, because of its very strong energy density, its transport and manipulation and storage facility, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good work whatever performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring anything back, so that equals things.
Take this to France!
Vote No. 18.
Are you a Guardian Webmaster?
As it was noted earlier: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
Yes, good work, guys.
Although many people like to mock the Scotland when they only lose, there is nothing to say, they bring a little color to the tourists when they arrive to qualify themselves, at least until they make themselves eliminate at the first turn.
It is even more strict if we play against them ;)
England begins to worry about me.
Because, now that the "shire generation" goes back, they may have a decent team with all these youths.
; Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the XI department, why can you change a team that wins?
The only footballer who, in my humble opinion, really was "international class", is David Beckham, a little famous, maybe, but I think if he tackled a patate in overwrist like me, he would be completely scattering me.
People forget his athletic constitution, otherwise, talking about athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I'm never moving Scotland.
I have the tendency to surprise by watching their warm colors with nostalgie at the end of evening...
The only footballer that, in my humble opinion, really was "international class" is David Beckham
Yes, people often forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It is certain that Juppe would be difficult to ask 100000 euros for a Conference in South Korea.
And not sure he would get them if he asked them...
You mean, people are coming to make a good shot?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, lives only on its members' compensations...
I am particularly asking myself to know what he can tell in his conferences.
How to reduce his deficit?
How to return to full employment?
I would say that no serious conference of a scientific discipline, even if he is a holder of a Nobel price, will think of a minimum amount.
Conferences with content are most of the free or almost time.
And I can assure you that these young people work really and that the results presented in their conferences - thanks - are real.
At the time of restrictions on the research budget, the reporting of these two figures is building.
The conferences of researchers are even paying for the lab!!!!
That's to say...
Everything's lighting for me.
They're looking at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the UMP ethics.
Do I have the impression that we're reproaching him to win money?
I'm far away from being one of his fans, but we're reproaching him of having bad (or fraudulently) management his campaign OK.
But to do with references, I have to be a very real activity.
In order to guard Nina's comment, let us remember that its movements are supported by contributors.
Epidemiology rule 1: isolation.
All American and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended for weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than politically correct.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What density of population infection is that politicians will decide to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane for Spain, and then I represent a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola empires in Western Africa, I am sure that they are prohibiting all flights and battles in the direction of the United Kingdom.
We always needed to send goods that says...
What damage that the international media panic on Ebola is no longer used to talk about less spectacular, but more mortal health crisis that affect West African people.
We're all threatened.
In every angle of the world, men, women. It's a journalist article so sad, a big title so low.
I could read each paragraph and replace the words men in other contexts (all of the relevant): Women are the first caregivers - read - men traveling from a community to another, etc.
Such more intelligent comments could have been made on the ways, reasons and places where we all can contribute to better understanding and interpretation of cultural and sociological approaches, and differences in the role of sex that could help combat Ebola in Western Africa.
Come on, let's go down there, think, and write, we don't like to make a sound.
There's a moment for everything.
If you are not able to offer a good analysis and a smart opinion, maybe you should just think before writing?
Although I would put the female genital mutilation on the same range as the decaptation - a form of terrorism as barbaric, its survival rate only makes a different form of torture - say that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" exceeds understanding.
In fact, I see that the contributor is of Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validity" to its opinion, but in this case it obviously gives a better perspective than the one of a median activist in the street.
And I believed that the Guardian was “making ” as a worldwide resource of journalism in the 21st century, delaying its fundamental requirements.
Who, in the editorial team, let this appear?
For a territorial or other election the money doesn't count.
I read soon that territorial function increases its effectiveness, and I have never seen a article giving them the word or trying to explain why.
It would be realistic .
There will be lies without doubt and truths to us to separate the good grain from the wheat .
The Court of Auditors is dear to tell so many economic disasters.
It's true that they never had anything to handle people from Cambon Street.
CTs are not in deficit, they have financial needs that can only involve investments they make.
It forces to use too flexible concepts of press as the World plays all obscurances.
The debt is beneficial because it finances investment, collective inheritance
Unfortunately, the debt finances particularly the costs of operation...
And as the superbuilding of officers (for example, to make good round points) leads to a growing and incompressable burden (obligatory load until their death, since life + retirement work), these collectivities are silent in investments.
It is therefore necessary to remove the status of officers, first to decrease the funds.
And also make the majors financially.
It is fabulous that intercommunities would have to comply with a decrease in common effects, and it is the inverse thing that happens, showing that re-equality is not effective without deleting others.
How do you want to handle big territories such as cacahuets at the time of the TGV and car?
The time of the horse in which these territory were created is revolutionary, maybe it would be time to respond.
They wouldn't prefer to stay in prison, worst injured, in the administrative toilet, would it seem!
Let's even try thrown, This is not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the state of the Vème has led with its providers.
This really started with Peter.
Then he continued to go to the "to the end of the soul" series that arrived strongly about it.
Why are they not going to live in a apartment of 250 million dollars in Monaco above a movie to leave all this souffrance behind them?
Europe is also built on a cimeter, which will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people take care of themselves?
Do not even try the answers of the type "is the mistake of white".
"Reply" does not "reply"
I really hope that it's sarcasm.
It was in my post, if it wasn't clear enough.
That's what happens when we move to be the first.
Whether or not, there is an argument to pass.
Now we agree that the modern Homo Sapiens has developed in North East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and in a particular humid period about 150,000 years ago they have been able to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the eight thousand years last) is part of the history.
The current Defence Minister had stated a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lyed.
It was certainly the only one of the government that seemed to keep the road.
Now, we know we can't trust him anymore.
Demission!
in 2017:Transformation to a comfortable hotel of dark places for future retractions from the Republic?
The start of the age dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a physician for nantis and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medical.
We're going to economy money, and the soldiers will take care of the grippe of the little else.
Do you know that 70% of the patients sound civilians, all horizons?
Londres Wasps?
I have mercy on their fans based on Wycombe/Londres.
Like London Irish and London Welsh?
They left London the past season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It changes that a football team uses the land of a rugby club instead of the inverse.
Furthermore, the outside movements for the Tigers and the Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
At Stockport County, we had the wrong to be purchased by the Sharks Halls, and we ended by praising our own stage with them once we found our independence.
I was going to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training on the field, although they had access to other locals, we did no favor.
I like supporting Coventry City.
Good news doesn't stop.
There is always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has no bad supporters and which has been at top for more than 30 years, to see his stage renewed by a rugby club.
I have aware of the recent problems of the CCFC but this must be a good guy.
For my part, I'm not the Club rugby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who doesn't do it except a few fans of the Wasps at work.
Each and a few thousand other people in the South East will certainly follow them away or will they now have to support another team?
Good article pro-domo and good polling.
But who's worried about it?
But why not all computer systems are based on these concepts?
+ because a giant mass of programs exists (cobol, java), + because all systems do not need them, + because there is no ++ magical baggage....
And because for most of the computer systems, bugs do not really have importance, which is to be the first of the segment.
The travels of G.
Berry relates to a need of noise.
Mr. Gérard Berry.
We should continue (the media) of such persons, who work for the goods of mankind.
For children.
I know that.

But they don't sell.
Real time information has become a key sector in many areas, and few are those who know the intimate details of these processes.
It's 15 years ago I didn't go to a Olive Garden.
The quality price report has decreased.
I'm sorry for those who will lose their job, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices that popularity is known.
Decrease costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our food regimes.
Don't ask Olive Garden to not put salt in the future.
It seems that they reason with Faisons more profits, not the Faisons of healthier places and the best quality-price report.
They're taking us for pigeons.
Oh, yeah, take care of that people don't have too much gressin.
And then let's make our soap by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there is plenty of salt inside, it replaces the real ingredients.
It would be good to make some sodium glutamate.
The quantity of salt you have to → in the water of the packets is unnecessary, but it wellfies considering the go of the finished product.
It is not only the go of the salt, but it also affects the way they cook.
The finished product is so much better.
Without sole, there is no food.
Each should try alternatives to the business kitchen.
Are there families restaurants and offers safe places for reasonable prices?
What happens in the United States is very sad.
A banal accident of work that was wrong-handed.
A young promising, taught a stealer, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man was all over and brutally interrupted this vocation of birth.
That it is condemned at 10 years of prison seems to be the minimum.
Where are we going else?
Totally agreed!
What a humor!
The desire to cover it is obvious and difficult and blameable at the same time...
Actually, it is hard to excuse the sending to cover it.
That's what makes me a certain sympathy for a 15-year-old boy.
During the trial, the father of the city complained that he would never see his son again but without asking for forgiveness to the neighbor who he himself killed.
Who is really victim in this story?
What are you coming to mix all!!?
The father of the woman was condemned for what he did.
About the cognition of lost balls, the accused and guilty, he knew exactly that the balls were dangerous.
It didn't do anything to the accused!
Let him therefore pay for the crime he is responsible!
10 years, it's a little much to me.
For having the intelligence to shoot this young man to make a sound?
Actually, that's a sound!
If the opportunity is present, go to vacation in the Mosul valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small victories.
This makes me do it twice, wine, landing and food are excellent.
Moreover, if you are there during one of the many vine festivals that are in each commune, it's still better.
Excuse me, the valley of Moselle, I've hit too quickly.
It's a pleasure to see that German wine is recognised.
Instead, the German winners use traditionally only one variety of grain, which means that they really need to be hard to keep a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations make experiences with different grains, such as France, Italy, etc.
There is only the region of the Mussel that must be recommended - France, the Palatinat Renan (Pfalz), Baden deserves to be visited.
A French interesting region is Alsace, which is like a mix between Germany and France.
The wine is of German (or maybe it is the inverse, short).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink wine after food.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during food, they now offer much, and with a much higher alcohol content than their preferred 9 degrees.
But their traditional wine is so complex, the doctor is superly balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad's spatles with a thermidor hoar next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online for a good choice.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
The World Atlas of Wine of Hugh Johnston is a good guide, superly illustrated.
I understand that there will be new readers of the Guardian who cover the wine, but this is a series of each journal article on the German wine since the night of the time.
In time, there is a article on the German wine that is coming, the new secs of Baden that are now going to join the plates, the reds that are wonderfully vigourous, but especially, these are not the Liebfraumilch dego dego that people are drinking when they were young (heu, I really don't think it's always true or evocator, unless I address me to more than 40 years - which, as I say, will have already seen all this).
Closing the Val de Grace would be a huge error and an illustration of the lamentable state in which the Administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a pine in my grandfather's foot and my grand-oncle's back, who have done their studies there.
In democracy, health management should be submitted to the vote of the House of Members: these ministerial chambers held by the barbecue, and these closed decisions at home have become unsupportable.
Sorbogroin is right.
It should be done as in Soleil Green: euthania at 70 years.
Moreover, we could sell the meat that will feed our poor (sic) actives because they can't go on the market anymore.
Actually, find work to our unemployed, real work, and you will have no deficit problems anymore!
For elderly people, it was time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
The assets will not be able to keep this demographic transition only...
So of geriatry, of course, but to think otherwise than a hospital model of 30 glorious.
Now the maximum growth of 1.5% (that is already the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to repeat the model set after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of the excellence in the medical matter in France: a certain rigor and discipline that we know more in the hospital.
If this symbol falls, we're really wrong.
We're crazy because the rest of hospitals is not at the height.
The scandal is that the presidents and other elections are able to take care of other than at the hospital.
The solution is more in the increase of the service offer in other hospitals than to keep a doctor at two speeds.
The Val is a French pharmaceutical pool, and, of course, a symbol.
Closing would be a mistake, a sign of more walking to France's mediacrit.
Without talking about military status, which must be kept absolutely.
"The Hospitalisation Day Price", a hospital management unit, is decided by the Ministry with local supervision of the Regional Hospitalisation Agencies.
Our nation's abhorrence continues.
Finally, I mean, obviously the baby is only one of these economic resources, but he came to have a better job payable than the one he had with him.
In almost all the countries of the world, a child born in this country of two non-citizen parents is almost always uncivil.
Australia goes far from most countries by making children born of Australian residents of citizens.
However, Australia is criticized because it does not respond to certain high note standards, with evidence of difficult consequences.
Why?
It seems to make two weights of two measures.
Env° Abbott in the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, to end all Persians and maltraitions and wars that make the people of their country escape and force them to seek help.
If he doesn't want people to come by ship, then we need to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I don't have to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
Civil war was 26 years old, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, war ended six years ago and the country returned to the normal.
Everything takes his sense now, Nimrod...!
It's strange that the British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe this little supercheck when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron stated war crimes and maltraition that were still happening.
Many European countries have already suspended the deportations of the Tamouls with a link to the TE, thinking that they would cover the risk of torture at their return.
The UNHCR reviewed its guidelines for the assessment of asylum applications in December 2012, and recommended that persons with link to the ETTE be considered as riskful at their return.
The year [2013] has seen a summary of attacks by Buddhist military groups against Hindu and Muslims.
The elections for three provisional advice were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Mr. Nowak, you've got the coco with so much p'dic.
Actually, this guy couldn't even get a chance to do it.
He didn't have a health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been given any treatment.
I would like to know who will pay for the medical expenditure during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas maybe, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes later.
Especially in Texas
Ah, ah!!!!!!!
There was a few years ago, we were explained that the ebola kills so quickly that a large widespread epidemic was impossible ( there is all a scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of counterparty of people returned was nul.
It's more funny, more scared, more scared.
You have to read fun newspapers to believe that a risk can be no.
It's low or even three weak but not zero.
Finally, it is a scientific reality, more a virus is deadly (generally) less he has chances to spread because the death of the host signs his own death.
The combination of the 2 (height transmission and fast death) is sometimes out of the Spanish grippe.
Awareness is the fourteen general to save humanity. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There is nothing obscene to make mediatics of certain good and vertuous oils forward, but to detriment of thousands of other African sick people who do not know the officer, the bravory, or the vertus?
Of course, this lights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help, but the repeat of the announcements is of a terrible partiality.
Freedom of expression, so loved by conservators.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors have voted for Newman and Abbott, armed brothers attacking the freedom of expression and the right to the private life of the people.
I guess they have never imagined that their conservators would have lost them from their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors have voted for Newman and Abbott,
I guess there's someone who's not gonna do it next time.
Yes, this is exactly what we need at this time, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A warming tour for when the problem is actually out of control.
There are no longer enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like that.
Tony Abbott's participation in the "War" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new finishing market fund for Medical Research, which should reach $20 billion from 2020, would only be a black box of emergency for the budget.
By using the pretext of the noble medical research, he will collect $20 billion and, on a later date, transfer these funds as a general income.
I hope the Australian voters will come to see this excellent Russia for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we don't want to believe.
It explains that Medibanke’s sale is made by the Final Market Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for sick people, a loss for elderly people and a loss for low income people.
Maybe it's very smart, but it's not just.
Finally, the "Lighter Ronger" and its Marketing Fund at the end of Telstra were excellent tutors.
If that's not just, let's show Abbott who is smart.
Env't in hell to the next election.
The most terrible for Nadine is even the "ancient personality", sad....
I also noted it, quite corrosive as noted.
If only it could disobey her to keep a buzz on her constantly.
The worst destination for a policy at the end of the career: not recognised in the street.
Hello She has not been recognized in her city of Toul as sufficiently at the height to administer it.
How good the “provinced ” sense is!
We've lived a hateful time, Ma'am Morano.
I'm sure against the port of the Burka, but there's no question.
What this anecdote is the sarcozism in the pure state: small mediacs with a range of ministers, a confusion between the government function and the execution function (if Sarkozy could come with his tonphas on each actor of the road to show that he is well guarded by the public order), grossness and disrespect to their maximum degree.
I propose that the right of Morano, Sarkozy and all these "ex-personalities" become unemployment to carry out a fire-weapon and an incense, which would be pleasing to exercise their auto-proclaimed function of judges.
But who is Nadine Romano?
In fact, this is the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned Sarkozy's page, maybe they don't even regret it.
He really needs to stop before it becomes angry for him.
I'm sending this agent who ignored the existence of Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
like bob, for the time
It doesn't agree, thanks to her, we're ridiculous ...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, she'd have to invent her!
However, it's easy, she's rid to Christine Boutin with a blonde peruque.
At that time, N.
Morano manifestly made in the misprise, in the mistreat of the police officer she had before her, and who would certainly have had to multiply the corbets and the "Yes Madam, of course, Madam, soon tell me Madam in which direction I should run to take me without waiting for this wheeled woman."
“ In one of the cases, the Super Hornets of Australia abandoned an air attack on a target of Isis when the risk of killing civilians became too important... ”
The Americans are not bad to this, but I think even though Jesus is going to over or have already done it, at least somebody counted the bodies here now no one does it.
For civil dead at the industrial scale, nothing is rival with the west war machine.
I do not agree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-o·tals) between the two Iraq wars would have costed life to millions of Iraqites, especially children, elderly and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-government manifestants I knew would prefer the sanctions to defer the ‘ war machine’.
Did you also be the type of man who would prefer sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good note - the United Nations has acted increasingly and unconsidered in recent years.
The sanctions are usually inefficient and are not affected by the elite - no doubt a reason why they have the opportunity of the self-declaring Security Council to be approved.
You may remember that the insects haven't lost time to mark their main enemy when they saw him in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the UN Mission's QG that they had committed nearly five days ago in Bagdad in 2003.
They hit this place with power and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and blood-freed.
So brutal and hard that bombardment, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission has been targeted like that.
Good note, I really forgot this.
So half a million people of the total number of deaths of Western nations (at least with recent troubles in Ukraine, the economic activity was directed to the people they intended to hurt).
It does not help your arguments only to adjust noteworthy statistics.
The only five-year-old figures even reliable on the dead are the children of less than 5 years, and they are even very suspicious because Saddam Hussain has set up to allow target inspectors to find the facts.
It was obviously in its interest that the negative effects of sanctions were adjusted.
The most reliable believe that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200 000 and 400 000, but no one really knows.
As regards additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are not better than hypothesis.
Since the number of pre-sanctions in the least of five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, the number of post sanctions could be largely partial to this age group.
Obviously, we need to be afraid of her, but also the gift of the gates in general.
We need to stop doing as if people were pure spirits, that love was all that children needed, and that we could do them with inconstants that neither the parents nor the child could ever know without consequences for them.
One of our based myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French are genealogy.
It's a crucial and disappointed thing to know his origins.
Instead of doing as if it was evident and using fantastic arguments, we should explain what serious problems could occur for a child adopted or designed with a gift of gatetes.
If you realize that the parents who have raised you have not provided the gates you are out of, you could, in my opinion, repeat it, because they would not have committed any crime.
The latest progress in the PMA (e.g. rubber) is at least as discretionable as a GPA reasoned in the framework.
The true question is to me: the frustration of children's desire justifies these acrobats and this does not have anything to do with marriage for all.
Very like a point.
It is obvious that we need to fear the GPA, what is that stupid question?
Of course, it's sad that you can't have a child when you want it.
It's a problem I met my wife.
However, it is less serious than to be born very disabilities or to become it, to contract a serious disease, to lose all its children in an accident, etc.
Of all the concerns of life, this is not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
It doesn't stop living.
And we can always take care of others' children!
In a company that does not support any form of frustration anymore, where the child becomes a good consumption, the GPA is inacceptable for me.
The child's desire is not a capsule where we could use the other.
Sterelity requires reflection and acceptance.
