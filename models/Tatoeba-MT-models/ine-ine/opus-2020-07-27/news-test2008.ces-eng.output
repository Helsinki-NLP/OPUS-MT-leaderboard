Inflation in Europe has sprung for food
Inflation inflated in the euro is primarily caused by the continuous growth of food prices.
The price growth in 13 euro countries was higher than expected, after 2.6 per cent in October was registered on 3.1 per cent annual inflation, the Luxembourg statistical office of the Union announced.
The official predict assumed only 3 percent, reported the Bloomberg Agency.
The European Central Bank (ECB) did not decrease the basic rate by the US, British and Canadian Banks by reducing the inflation spirals together with increased prices of cereals and decreasing unemployment.
The ECB would maintain the inflation pair under two percent, but in their nearby.
According to one of the analyses, the ECB is in absurdity: the inflation has to "reduce" so that she does not have to do anything in this matter later.
In Germany, the inflation of November is 3.3% of the 15-year 15-year record; then in Spain it is 3.6 to 4.1%.
The inflation in the euro was exhausted up because of the growing prices of food and energy.
The term prices of wheat decreased by 88 per cent, and the course of soja has also reached the highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay more for eating and milk products.
The world market price was 52 percent in this year, and the past month, one black gold barley was 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, the inflation is in 2008 from 2.1 per cent to 2.5, but in 2009 the inflation is decreased to 1.9.
According to the analysis, the level of 12 months of inflation remains in the following 3-4 months remaining around 3 per cent, but its average annual rates will be 2.5 per cent.
At the same time, it expects the ECB to decrease the rates two times during 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
Fidesz's movement area after deleting stagnation to beginning has grown significantly, and now it has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of Gallup's socialists, the institution has not yet measured 13 percent support.
In the case of real electors, the party would, due to the greater determination of opposition electors, represent more than two-third (71 per cent) aid to the extent of the fiveth support of the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are under the dust of access to Parliament: their support in the entire population is two percent.
Among certain party electors, both hosts of the camps are one percent more.
The opinion of the public on the economy has also deteriorated as regards the previous minimum - never has been the proportion of those who consider the economies of the country to be very bad, so high - 41 per cent, while, according to the other 46 per cent, the economicity is fair enough.
Families evaluate their changes in their materiality after jewelry and summer views now more pessimistic.
As regards the next year, the largest part of the population counts with further deterioration and only decades with improvement.
The 71 percent of the questioned, which is most of all Gallup's relevant investigations that the Prime Minister is doing his work more wrong than well.
Ferenci Gyurcsány or very 13 percent of the questioned, while Victor Orbán is 38 percent of the beneficiaries.
The Prime Minister doesn't believe 54%, the President's movement Fidesh 27%.
One of the indicators of political development is how large the public thinks that uncomfortableness with the Prime Minister is possible to resolve without a change in government.
While the government and the Prime Minister considered the demand of 35 per cent after the low-term disorders, this share is currently only 20 per cent, while the relative volume (33 per cent) looks at the solution only in writing new elections.
For reference interest, 60 per cent of the questioned answered to the question regarding their events that it would certainly come to the referendum and reported to the other 20 per cent that it would probably come.
For comparison, "parlamental elections of this Sunday" would certainly have only participated in 55% and 15% would be considered likely. The success of the reference would be uncertain on the basis of the current purposes.
The school would say no 74, 79 payments and 84 percent residence in the hospital.
If we look at the same part only in the area of people who are certain of their promises, then the introduction of schools, taxes in the doctor and payments for residence in the hospital would refuse 81, 84 and 89 per cent.
The most dear is Auchan, the team of the fifth hooked Tesco
The hypermarkets in the Buddhist Trade Triangle maintained a lonely, in average 16% of price level growth, with the difference that the year did not increase the RDP.
- Napi Gazdaság's journal
The classic breakfast breakfast of Napi Gazdaság in the Buddhist trade triangle this year increased by 16 per cent, but in all hypermarkets the price increased notefully over thousands of forints.
Since the prices in the supermarkets have been "flowed" have already been inflammated in the area, percent, due to an earlier high base, have not been so drastic.
However, it is unpleasant that what they were able to purchase for the price under nine thousand forints is not now for ten thousand.
The needed cost of the Daily Economy in investigated hypermarkets exceeded the psychological border of ten thousand forints at least 91 forints.
The highest cost of the waste was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the needed cost was 6.800 forints.)
The price of the Union and of the living fish remained at the lower level, but they were very disturbed by the crushed breasts, ovens, and also by the mosque.
The prices of bread and milk corresponded to the data of the Central Statistics Authority, although we found a kilogram bread in Auchana for 139 forints.
The competition did not have the price of the product under 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this trade that the double Coca Coly price was under 200 forints, so the stock was only 257 forints.
However, this year, according to the needed paper, Napi Gazdaság Auchan appeared as the best, while Cora was the most important.
According to our reports, she highlighted the prices figured in the needed paper of Napi Gazdaság, given the prices of the birthday Cora at 15, while Tesco and Auchan approximately 18 per cent.
In comparison with the lower and annual lowest values of the needy was 12 per cent, while the growth between the lower and the year's lowest is 21 per cent.
In the forints there was an increase of 1 480.
The average increasing inflammation prices resulted in 1.206 forints by having the prices of Christmas affected by the growth of the DPH.
The marketing process just distorted, the trade houses were obviously not able to decide how to determine the high price costs of the property for individual products, since they could not be able to tell how the price changes would be affected.
(If a trademaker plans wrongly on the course of the product concerned, the price-adjusted intensity may be granted a significant profit due to an adjusted price.)
For the purposes of the DPH, the price of the needed cup of Napi Gazdaság was so extremely shown that the price of the lowest cup was 1 720 forints higher than in 2006, while the price range of 844 forints in the most important case.
This year, the national division has not been shown, the dearest cost was now with 1 630 forints more than the wheat and also the most important understream of 1 284 forints.
In comparison with both Christmas season, a disastrous price growth occurred, and in less than 20 months, the daily deterioration of goods in hypermarkets was more than 30 per cent.
(In other words, it is not absolutely confirming the data of the Central Statistics Authority: the measurement in the case of a number of basic food increased prices exceeding 30 per cent during 12 months.
Furthermore, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the last case, however, it seems to be impossible, according to the needed cash of the Day Economy, since the price level of the product, quite deep in the remote year, has been demonstrated in the light of the basis, and in the worst case, the price growth was more than 10 per cent.
The milk suppliers take up more stronger position than the egg suppliers, and the drastical increase of prices was also made available in international lines.
Hypermarkets in the commercial gold triangle are not difficult, they are still referring to the good year.
According to our experiences, the prices are no longer interested in three visited trades.
They buy all the quantity, the continuous food takes the payment.
In the middle of the afternoon, in all three supermarkets, long fronts were made in the store, since the number of visits has grown.
Of course, as we know, in the outside it is to turn the lower, more than a number of international travellers are trying to make surveying that markets remain for their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of a sustainable use of goods.
In many places, they look at desinfektion spectacles
More than thousands of cases of infection appeared mainly due to an accidental use of antibiotics were registered in the annual year.
Hygiene disease submissions, overflow of the beds, the burden of the stakeholder doesn't help, confirms the primary of the National epidemiological Centre.
In many places, they are also watching in desinfektion.
Recently, MRSA infection was in the traumatological division of Saint Jana’s disease.
Bacteria antibiotics were discovered in men who got into the hospital after serious transport accidents.
It was isolated.
Similar infections occurred at the same place at the beginning of the year.
The injury of the infection of MRSA was leaving home, but soon after the infection of the MRSA and because of a bacteria inhaling in its body could not have been performed a significant operation.
In the 10th year, Nesocomialis Surveillance has been reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance of 1 094 disease infections caused by multiresidential diseases, Karolina Böröč, the prime of the National epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multiresistent diseases have been registered in diseases with certainty, the finals are not known.
At the same time, two thirds (683) infections were caused by MRSA, or methicilin-oxaciline with gold resistant stone.
Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carries a third person in the nose without a disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cross-treatment, muscle, skin infection, random infection) are well reacted to antibiotics and are well treated.
However, antibiotics are given in excessive or inadequately, it is developed from a bacteria that is well reacting to antibiotics which are very distorted against antibiotics and which is spread in inadequate disease conditions.
Moreover, in transitional or slowly functioning of the immune system in patients with weak body, low body weight or in patients in years, sepsis may cause serious disease infections, such as rare infection or blood infection.
According to the top doctor of Saint Jana’s hospital, MRSA infection does not include any special, similar infections in diseases to daily practice.
"Infection should not be replaced by epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the disease is not examined."
Shoots antibiotics
"These patients are isolating, treatment staff treats them in gum hands and mass and we need antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients receiving in the hospital are previously investigated whether MRSA is present in their body, and that does not allow infection to be avoided.
Sample Reception Not in Mode
The majority of MRSA disease infections caused by MRSA would be possible to prevail, but the present conditions and subminations in home diseases are not for the prevention and spread of multiresistent illness illnesses, Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is significantly produced in illnesses and homes for elderly, patients accepted should be controlled and immediately isolated by MRSA.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian diseases is not in mode.
It also plays the role that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this investigation.
The most of the cases are so discovered if a patient suffers from a detective MRSA infection, the primary epidemiological centre has said.
The European Union has a close recommendation for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Ancient antibiotic therapy should be targeted or microbiological investigations should be conducted in order to avoid the result of resistance against drugs, but neither the hospitals in any case.
Recepts of microbiological samples are even more frequent in the basic, respectively ambulant treatment of patients, reported Karolina Böröcz.
Seeing on desinfektion spectacles
According to deep evidence, MRSA is most frequently spread among patients with health personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in moving hands and using hands and masks, but even in diseases there are serious deficiencies.
MRSA is transferred by capenna infections and touches, but in cases of home diseases is not only possible to isolate infected patients.
Rather, the rooms are often filled, the beds are often very close to themselves, perhaps from epidemiological views patients should be removed at least 1.5 meters.
As Karolina Böröč noticed, despite all, we can also meet that in diseases that are affected in an improportional material condition, we watch disinfectation, the patients are few, and the patients are much increased in the possibility of infection.
According to Karolina Böröčová, there are necessary protective measures, similar infections indicatively less or further extent of the disease can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a major expenditure for health security, so it fights everywhere.
For example, in England, the Government wrote MRSA prevention programme, respectively reduced its production.
The program seems to be successful, according to published data show MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Prevention and Control of Sickness (ECDC) aims to prevent the occurrence of multiresident pains (including MRSA), respectively infections caused by these diseases, among their priorities.
The policeman who caused a mortal accident was not drunk
The official investigation in the case of police ́an XXII, which caused a mortal accident, is ready.
It can be said that the police officer XXII, who killed the walker on Wednesday, and who was departed from his own, would lead under the influence of alcohol or potential substances, would inform the speaker of the Supreme State Representative of Attila Morvai on Friday after the final investigation of this case.
The finding trial confirmed the result of the original investigation, which had already found that the former policeman had been seated before he was seated for a voter, had no alcohol.
The Police Director of the XXII Country struck on Wednesday in Lajose Kossutha, in XXII, by his own car, in the department of fifty-five-year-old men, who went in before to carry out a specific transition.
(Latest named that the walking has passed outside the zebra, finally, in accordance with the rules of the road operation, is not a disturbing situation, the removing car must also give advantage.)
He died after he was transported to the hospital.
Because of these attacks, the circuit police manager departed from the office and requested the transfer to the debt, according to the police notice, because he was so disturbed.
In this case, the Budapest Research State Representative is conducted.
Attila Morvai has also changed as the former policeman has cooperated with the state representatives of investigations.
Other 400 million euros for infrastructure
Three credit assets in total 400 million euros for the support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as energy signed on Friday in Budapest, the Minister for Finance of Janos Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved the Hungarian budget financing of projects in transport and life-related supported by Cohesion Fund, a value of 300 million euros, while the parties already closed the credit rating of 100 million, now signed with regard to the use of 200 million euro remaining.
Also, for the budgetary financing of school-related projects, the credit agreement is EUR 150 million.
The EIB approved for Hungary in total, 300 million euros, for the rest of 150 million euros, with the extension of the loans.
In the innovation they signed 50 million euro parties, which will mainly use budget for the Debrecian University Research and Development Project.
There was also a 4-way meter speech for negotiations.
The parties agreed that after Hungary's agreement with the EU's financing details, they would return to whether and how to modify the financing with the EU.
This can happen in the first quarter of 2008, according to Janos Verese.
The EIB has financed in Hungary since 1990 a total of EUR 8.4 billion of 113 projects.
The credit tax provided by the EIB for eight-yearly waiting period and without the obligation provision shall be liable to the EURIBOR tax.
Bulgaria is an EU reality
The development of the Bulgarian illegality market is terrible - the attention of the whole Europe is going to return to the Balkan country in a few times.
What, where and who purchases yet the most important, but is it with the EU market that is trading?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Division of Re/Max.
The most seeking east-European purchases of unnecessary purchases is now, of course, Bulgaria with its leaving lizard apartments and houses at the sea coast.
The most of the mountains are in the course of Bansko, Borovc, Pamprovo and Vitosha, then in the sea coast of Albena, Golden Sands, Solar Coasts, the ancient city of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more people are also looking for inability in the Cavarna and Baltic areas.
According to the analyses from Re/Max Bulgaria, the investors and the central part of the country will be interested first or later - for example, Graniko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and still more interested people will be purchased in the area of the Russian League city.
The main city of Sofie is also the promise of a substantial opportunity, trade and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is the best way to change into one of the most attractive golf areas of Europe, so that it becomes summer and cold to the aim of the road and the next two-year periods.
Previsible investors already buy in a large, for example in the area of the Bank.
According to the analysis, buyers of illegality in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives and life.
Most customers come from England, but purchasers from France, Others, Spain, and even more often from Romania.
There are also Malta and Cyprus investors, in the Black Sea and in the Ligaries, then, traditionally, many Russian customers.
For the purchaser is able to divide into three groups, says Georgius Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Injurious people buy or renewable inability in value of 50-100 thousand euros, or determined old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which then renew.
They require good availability and communication options, which are important to them in the nearby of a large city, trade and property of local doctor.
The second category is chat buyers (Bulgaria was organized in the first 10 German recreation targets in the provinces).
The third group consists of commercial investors who purchasing a value in the middle or Horizon.
Treatment of insolvency in the main city is inevitable, because the question is more strong.
However, in Bulgaria, the lowest prices of reality in the European Union, but in the last five years, 21 per cent increased annually.
Increasing incapacity prices is significantly higher than payment growth.
Fodor and Hungarian six percent
According to the information of the Ministry of Life and the Water Economy of Gabora Fo, the meeting of experts will be completed on Tuesday, and after the central official start, the international climate regime will continue by the United Ministers after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are about the Pacific Card of Bali, which resolves the efforts following the period of reduction of the Kyoto Protocol applicable until 2012.
At this point, a storm discussion between developing and developing countries is being discussed.
The United States also announced that they now do not want to act on precise numbers, although they are attached to the agreement to reduce glass gas by 25-40 per cent in the 1990 state until 2020.
Another big question is whether developing countries will approach other than decreasing the decrease of material and so-called assistance to countries that have been rejected.
The Agreement also took place on contributions to developing countries.
The Investment Fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be conducted by the 16-member Government Council, most likely in the World Programme for Life Protection (GEF) at the United Nations - we can read in the Piac es Profit magazine.
Hungarian six per cent
The Ministry of Life and Water Economy Gábor Fodor, named Hungary, supports the EU's attempt to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and help the development of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister noted that the EU was committed to reducing gases by 20 per cent of levels of 1990 by 2020, regardless of the success of the adoption of "the Agreement after 2012", and is prepared to decrease up to 30 per cent in the case of the rest of the world's growth, the respective developing countries will be willing to accept the responsibility and obligations that correspond to their option.
Gabor Fodor pointed out that the countries attached to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 were estimated as a decreasing target of 5.2 per cent, while 15 EU Member States at that time were committed to 8 per cent.
The complaint of Hungary is to decrease the decreasing of glass gases by 6 per cent in the years 1985-87, which will be fulfilled by our government.
The Bali is very important because there is no need to adopt a international agreement on the climate change policy within two years, otherwise its entry into force with certainty until 2012. In this case, the United Nations International College, which remains with climate changes - IPCC, which is the Nobel Price Price Porter, would not immediately refer to the need in its latest report.
This would lead to late reduction and unreductional increase in the average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsia, which would have, according to the spectators, extremely serious and unreverseful results.
British Army leads a crowd on YouTube
British military units publish on a server to share video records from action in Iraq and Afghanistan, which are popularized themselves.
YouTube first prefered British airport forces (RAF): special units operating here in Afghanistan since March 2006, reported BBC.
The ships made by a miniature camera attached to the aircraft are controlled by the command of air forces managing war operations in Kandahara and then sent further to London, where they are transferred to the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
In this form, 139 British Air Force soldiers have already been recorded on the Internet, and their "canal" has already been viewed as more than 75 thousand people.
The British Defence Ministry was registered in June 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and published records of action in Iraq and Afghanistan while the British Ministry has its own channels (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) on YouTube.
Saat in Afghanistan
The air forces have published videos in accordance with their plans for the assembly and the Ministry of Defence are good to communicate the broad public with the goal of the presence of the army in the defence.
"Prohibition published by this form of a traditional TV advertising is nothing worth," BBC's expert on the defence of Gordon Mackenzie, "but it is necessary to take a certain political message in itself, because the special form confirms the right to military action that the government has decided."
Americans made a game
The Army causes anxiety that, according to carefully modified, censured records, the server also reaches amateur videos, such as the death of soldiers: in a few covered, "official" propagation films, the majority of the students speaks about losses, but there is no bloody shape of battle.
Finally, there were many videos on the Internet from the fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, which appeared at a slow seed, but the British army has come on them until now.
America's Army, which is free to stand and in which the player can at least have a more unfair simulation directly to the soldiers.
At the Ministers, Christmas will be with a tomb and a pagazzi
The Ministry of Lamperth's work is obviously not emotional: instead of a breakfast party, he arranges for its cooperation a final work in the meeting, which is divided by pagazzies and coffee with 2007.
Some ministers will celebrate with living music, otherwise they will eat the officers with the tombol and topics of birthday atmosphere.
Wednesday, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and Swedish tables - so they enjoy strong.
The State authorities are also prepared for Christmas.
The most basic ministerial celebration this year is organized by the Defence Minister, but it does not expect its employees.
Native poor ones will receive gifts to children of falling soldiers, at the missionary holidays of the family members of soldiers who are currently served at the missions of the missions, but also organize receptions for journalists.
Resort's on the atmosphere of the end of the year 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will exit from the final resorts.
The GKM dinner is organized at the center of Jøv·Háza, at the total of 4 320 000 forints, and of six hundred ministerial employees is expected about 350 guests.
Resort will keep Christmas traditions at its celebration, but it will also come to different exhibitions and will also lose the tombol.
The NFU's birthdays were 4 700 000 forints and were in the middle of the Construction of the State Justice Council (OIT) - the programme had concerts and dinners.
A million of forints, the rest was charged for more than four hundred invited.
One NFU seems to be invited to another holiday celebration: there is a company insuring trends, the Hungarian Economy Development Centre (MAG) of Union money.
After this, they found a Wiggsinaz district building.
MAG and S. have not confirmed this information because we haven't been able to reach the person concerned.
The clothes are not required
The OIT building was not only NFU, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which organized a 7-year-old dance in place of Christmas.
However, the OIT did not want money for the use of its sales.
Five hundred people participated in the floor.
Wednesday he started the medical minister, and after dinner, he could dance for the delivery of living music.
According to the response to the question of the portal [origo] on the dance, there were no obligation for dinner clothes or clothes.
Puritan party wants health, jobs and local self-resorts.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and celebration for employees for 400 000 forints in their own building.
The Ministry of Lamperth's work of Monique's cooperation is not even officially calling to Christmas party, but to the final work of the meeting.
100 guests are calculated, which, according to the printing division, will only receive coffee and coffee, so there will be only 350 000 forints for the party.
Gordon Bajnai's local autonomous Ministry will easily contribute to its cooperation in the Ministry of Local Rights and Regional Development Hall.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a breakfast meeting expected by 436 workers in its own large room.
At the holiday party, it takes 2 500 forints on a host - the total amount includes reception with Swedish tables and coverage.
Since the time as Minister Janos Veres, the PM Christmas works in the same way every year.
The atmosphere of the party, however, will fail, officiality will strengthen not only the ministerial statement but also the afternoon time.
The resort of agriculture is organized on 20 January, the Ministerial Wednesday is not finished.
The reception is in the city of Vajdahunyadvár in the towns and, according to the Department’s notice, 1 000 forints per person are appointed for 100 guests.
According to the printing division, a very simple receipt is invited only to the relevant credit diplomates in Hungary.
These annual receipts begin a short health minister and finish with a small invitation.
The Ministry of School and Cultural Ministry doesn't organize Christmas Festivals at all, communicated to the [origo] portal the relevant printing division.
The price of the birthday celebration of the residence of life in the printing division could not be communicated.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to celebrate in the Museum of Artaxerxes.
Switching to the cover of the staff
The Liga Collection of Communities, respectively the State Union of the Working Council (MOSZ) shall establish its staff Commission on Friday for the coordination of the Monday unlimited staff.
On Saturday, protesting public meetings will be stopped on Monday - on the final vote on health insurance law.
The action will certainly cause a serious interruption of transport, since the railway transport will be completely stopped and will also be established by Budapest Transport Undertaking (BKV) within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Liga Association will meet together with the National Working Board's Communication with the details of the organized Monday staff together.
It will also result from the LIGA-MOZ Staff Commission, which will coordinate Monday action.
On Saturday, protesting public conferences will be made, and from Monday, the committees associated with the staff will stop the work for a time unexpectedly, unless it is agreed with the government.
This means that there is no time limit for the end of the staff, which comes on the voting day of Parliament on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament would not finally accept the Health Insurance Act, the committees will immediately download the challenge to the staff.
However, the legislation will be revoked, the staff committee shall be meeting and shall decide on another procedure.
According to the Monday Meeting of the Parliament, it is also possible to vote on the Health Insurance Act at the latest evening, in the event of night.
As a result of Monday's starting station, it is possible to calculate serious transport interruptions: on the railway work will be stopped for an undetermined period, the afternoon can be stopped by the part of Budapest chromatic transport and more than half of Volán.
At the same time, there will also be places in many countries to close half the roadways.
The invitation to the staff has been joined by the Citizens and civil organisations whose list is continued to be updated on the sites of the Liga Association.
Some organizations have announced the staff for an unexpected period, and others have declared a temporary stop of work.
On Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Roads (MAV) and the independent staff staff union of railway staff (VDSZZZ) were not able to agree either on sufficient services, while the start of Christmas Festivals travels on a railway with more people.
According to the reports, from the beginning of the operation to 13 hours at the BKV, from 7 to 9 hours in Budapest Airport, the four-hour work unions of the Committee in the energy industry of LIGA will be organised by the Board of Pedagogs and the Democratic Group of Pedagogs.
The association of Hungarian physicians will be established in the whole country, the Democratic Committee Union of Health Workshops and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), which belongs to the Cooperation Forum of Professional Unions (SZEF), has a two-hour exhibition of stage.
The most important of the four requests formulated by the Liga Association is that the Government rejects the reform of health insurance and presents a new concept to the public debate.
The second requirement is that a new method of calculation of income is applied gradually from the next year.
Third to ensure that the preliminary income for the relevant work is the possibility of entering into the system before 2010.
The fourth point of the action is that the Independent Group of Training Workers (VDSSZZ), falling under the Liga Committee Association, does not accept the proposal for the Ministry of Economy and Transport relating to railway offices, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Garden increased the risk of the country
The activity of the Hungarian Garden based on the movement of Jobbik Magyarorzhágért in August of the year, according to the risk analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of the Political Capital Institute, immediately increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole of the health.
In the "Attention on the risk", the company developed is written: In relation to the activities of the Hungarian Garden, the largest political risk is that "without prejudice to the existing ethnic pressure between Roman and Nero, Hungary can also reach violent ethnic centres at a short time".
The vote is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Garden probably intends to implement such action - adds a research institution.
As it is written, this can explain one of the largest deficiencies of Hungarian political representatives: "The public debate on Roman issues has been left by the representatives of public life to radical and extreme political groups who could set a political strategy on the Rome-Hungrian opposite."
This problem is increasing, disabled by normal dialogue, enhanced extremists and increased the probability of providing violent conflicts - judges the institution.
Furthermore, the activities of the Hungarian Garden, according to the research institution, have been influenced by the great attention of households and staff media, "which has shown Hungary's image to a significant measure, especially as regards the faith in the stability of the country and its democratic growth."
Institut: A part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which have been obtained increasing publicity and universality since 2006, is that in Hungary, a number of organizations that are called as "national households" generations have been created from 2007.
"The common drawing of these groups is that they define themselves as a civil association, while they openly report - and armed - the preparation of their members to carry out defensive tasks (in the case of living disasters, the attacks of authority, the destruction of the right), and also with indication of the incapacity of police, army, or state," he adds.
It also notes that this is all in a way that is trying to packaging the more different political efforts set on the opposite of society to political and civil clothing parties.
The highlighting of civility and the form of community in the case of these groups is, therefore, not only to avoid legal resources of judicial registration, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Garden are also the factors increasing the risk of neighborhood relations.
"In the past months, the Hungarian Garden immediately in some neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, the ultranationalist political representatives of some neighbor countries want to excuse their own anti-Hungary policy by revoking the appearance of the Hungarian Garden.
All this may affect political stability," adds.
According to the research institution, there is no appearance of the Hungarian Garden in the Middle and Eastern Europe, which has increased the political risk for the whole.
The Hungarian Garden's activity is like, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Garden, which the creation has announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the Bulgarian garden, there are mass Rome's distress that have been stretched out in one of the Sophia quarters (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used to store the garden with the goal of the organization is "national household".
In the past 17 years, it stated that in Bulgaria, the "cicane terror", but the state remained inactive and hostile at the Political Capital Institute.
It adds that the initiative has led to a storm discussion of the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic stages, further, signals the notifications of some Bulgarian Roman organizations that it is a sign of opposition to its own garden.
Since the successful activity of the Hungarian Garden shows similarity to the activity of the Bulgarian National Garden, it is not clear that even Hungarian Romans react to a threat similarly, by establishing their own household, we can read in a warning on the risk developed by the Political Capital Institute.
Atila Juhász, research manager of the Political Capital Institute: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institution.
As he said, risk analysis issues every year and if it finds something that may affect risk changes, they inform public opinions such as in this case by giving a warning on the risk.
The holidays are not all free
In Hungary, the days of freedom are exactly set by the law, and it has already been a general practice that the days around the holidays are overwhelmed, which waits less for us in the next year.
In the European Union and in America, there are no units.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and national holidays and worktimes.
Working days of peace are weakened to the church at the holidays or to a significant historical attack.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is free - to New Year for people to rest after Silvester.
In the year, we have a total of 11 free holidays.
The National Festival is 15 March celebrating the revolution from 1848 and 23 October, the Memorial Day of Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the detention of the state, on 1 May, on 1st and 2 November, we focus on the dead family and friends.
Furthermore, we have two-day holiday Festivals of Grandpa, Aviation and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious festivals, according to the calendar, rarely appear for weekends, practices have been moved on the working day in cases that they worked before or after a free party.
The price for the long weekends, however, is that we stay at work and at school in the preceding Sabbath.
The day when the festival is without prejudice or follows it, we replace the work that the Minister of Work has been managed for long years in a special statement.
The legislation shall apply the same measure to all employees and their employees, public employees and public employees.
However, it does not concern the fire and institutions which are in operation without interruption or, in view of their designations, are also working in the days of working calm.
This year will change the working series only around the holidays at the end of the year: from 24.
In the next year, a few of our holidays are soon falling into, respectively to the end of the week, so the movements of the working day will be less than this year.
First, the calendar changes around the holiday of work so that workers can stay at home for four days of breakfast.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day so that it may be on Friday 2 May.
Next movement is related to Friday 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, it will work in place of Friday 24th.
The end of the year, however, will be able to continue completely in the sign of the holidays, because they will have almost everywhere the nonstop of the vacuum even though Silvestr appears in the middle.
Six scared little girls you can hurt your friends
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we will never receive, innocent lies, which we're not noticed anymore: this is all "forgetting" every day on the work.
The question is, if you are going to advance these little inappropriates, or if you are setting up hands and unexpected things that can end up with disappointment, you will avoid intentionally.
Types.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you from the marketing division," they'll tell you a colleague.
That's why you mixed the tissue?
In the best case, he regrets and trys to make it, if possible he calls the marketing section and says that the message has forgotten to send (it is less common solution).
Most often, the thing is resolved once with excuse.
Before it comes to a trap of discussion, it's good to think about what you could prepare for colleagues inappropriate behaviour, and try to prevent it.
Are you doing something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more inappropriate than when you get to the letter, office need or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember you put on the board yesterday, but she's gone?
Or did you reveal your pearls on the table of some of your colleagues that you thought you were lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, Otherwise they'll be disappointed by the right to get to them in things.
Do not remove the pack office or nice papers because it may be unfair when they come to you before, and you will need them immediately.
Coworking about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good solution to stop the spreadsheet.
Who, with who he did?
Where and why?
Don't know everyone on the nose of your news (domains) about the private life of colleagues!
If some of them share with you about their inner secrets, do not use his trust.
Close what you have heard and do not try with your friends, nor when it comes to the end of his matters.
You're noting your absency without any reason?
If you call to the office and with a revocation to a strong head pain, you report your absency because you are not good, or you say that you would like to rest today, you think that your jobs, incompatible jobs and works that have a certain term will have to do for you someone else.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know forward that the second day you're not going to work, or that something can happen for what you're gonna have to stay home, announce that your colleagues and leaders are not confronted with your absency until the second day.
Use, movement, phone
Did you get up to the job from which you've been driving a colleague?
Do you want to be a Witness of a phone talk that would be better not hearing anyway?
Don't stop your cooperation by using, changing, speaking voice (which is over the head), neither by due, uncontinued clothing, by sound uncomfortableness.
All this can be distorted even when they are not directly banned to a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you guilty of other mistakes?
If there is nothing time or you forgot to send an important letter or a message, do not blame for your forgottenness of others!
Don't call on a casual chaos dominant in the office and the sounds of colleagues!
Recall, if you wronged and someone paid it, and you're captured!
Ask how you can give the thing right, you're insane!
Do you feel too like home in the office?
Heatings and pauses: pleasant clothes at home, but they don't go to the office!
Don't take your clothes for free time, even if it allows your professionals!
Don't be weak, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming into the office in running clothes - and if your profession requires, beautiful and elegant!
When a person wants to speak, he stops to be interesting
Injury in the habitual damage of the throat.
It is called special melodies: the sound of the bullets to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding the volume.
Music changes time and adds the base to the previous tone colors, and then the woman’s congregation is joined as a pleasure.
At mr2 station, the Zagar group track is called Wings of Love.
Home musical life hasn't just blowned us with a quality electronic pop.
At once, but the bathroom looks pretty different, because you just listen to the new Zagar album.
Revelation of Yonderboie, a couple of new and interesting productions from the household digital underground changes slowly, and even though it is again a garage rock in the mode with its milk into the cytarr, even the domestic electrop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Baláz Zságer started in Pentecost, and he also played in Yonderboy's cup until the end - maybe because two fans don't go into one row - he gave his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music that connects elements of jazz, electronic dancing and pop, however, he began to prophesy until he was invited to compose video sound tracks (e.g.
"Szezon") film Ference Thuruka.
His formality, playing at the beginning in small clubs, recognized a widespread public after that the magazine wan2 organized their first album from 2002 between the fifty most important home tables and announced Zagar in Yonderboie for the only household entities that could be sold even on the Western.
Zagar and his captain are without doubt "in the course", even though no one asked them if they were peaceable with this pressure.
The capella reacted as it belonged: she made a new, better album.
Now issued album with the name Cant Walk Fly Instead can open them new paths, although the same name is trying to create a link with the beginning years in Pentecost.
It's one verse of the track of the older Baláz Zeager.
The reference to eternic, the flight would be at the place, but near the eterical breath of this music has now occurred - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of time - the voicefuler cytarr, the influence of rock and role.
In these songs, the Prime Minister in the Millenaris park represented the song György Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle.
Album also produced a real hit, thanks to the mr2 Petièrefi station, playing last time from the evening to the art of music, began to blow the wings of Love, replaced by six domestic songs ("Underground Divas").
So everything's okay.
Portal hvg.hu said Balázz Zsager.
hvg.hu: In relation to this new hit, a question will be offered, how much remains what you are playing in the area music?
Baláz Zságer: Definition of border music doesn't mean too much for me.
I think there are two different boxes easy music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even such a alternative, subground music can be a floor, they say nothing, and it can only occur because of the sale, which makes it commercially.
Of course, even a good pop track can explode from sincere internal needs.
This spirit also works as it is accepted, independently of the language and of the state.
hvg.hu: Do you see a division in the opening of the Hungarian and foreign public against your music?
B. Zs.: In the forest, especially from us to west, music has easier tradition.
There are not only teenages and people after twenty, but also elders.
Many more are monitoring the changes of light music running around them, as they also consider it part of the culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of public in your work?
You care about who listens to your music, where, where, and in how much of your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it's a good feeling that more people are walking on our concerts.
But we never did music for the market.
We don't have music with the goal, but with some kind of mind.
The role of the public is more than on concerts where the mutual impact is already functioning, but it is only hidden in inappropriate changes at a time.
Yet, I noticed that when a person wants to speak a public, he stops to be interesting since that moment.
hvg.hu: How much do you want to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He's working alone and he's building his career more than we've got to west.
B. Zs.: We are actually not going to his way, regardless of our music sometimes trying to explain.
We are rather a team player who focus on the music presence of the second and let it develop.
At the beginning, it was obviously necessary to avoid that our jobs were not compared to Yonderboie tracks, some of us were separated from his cup and spent another way.
hvg.hu: In the warmstation of mr2 Pet·fi, the Wings of Love track was found first.
Many have heard the name Zagar first in relation to this track.
Did you get the most popular levels inside with a larger level?
B.Z.: We shouldn't have planned to write a hit to which they sold the table.
It's more about that song.
We thought it as a final album that we tried to release this previous audio orgia and more complex topics.
How did you choose these six songs?
Why is it just - what was the main principle?
B.Z.: The idea was to create such a gospel congregation.
Then the idea came to compose this congregation from a solistic home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-party congregation - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterphy, Enikœ Hodosi [Neo], Yesterday Neemeth - which we were then baptized to Underground Divas.
Is that exactly what you thought about the song, or did the girls make something on her?
B.Zs.: The building already existed in a instrumental version, then when the material met on the table, we thought that there would be something more necessary for this track.
The Sled of the Accords was aware of a singing part to him.
On the day of the night, I sang a melodia that the girls learned after.
It was almost first and very spontaneously.
I wonder how it survived, but of course they needed Divy.
With my voice, it wouldn't work so energy.
Hvg.hu: Like on the table, the concert seemed to be girls in the background.
They don't have only (except Judy Jay), they have no own role, they don't sing together, and they're not more musical than music, so music does not only accept their songs.
They also stood back on the river.
Is that meaningful?
B.Z.: The standing behind was only because of technical problems.
That we didn't want to divide the single role is intended.
And this song is about it, and they forgot a little of their egos, from where they are, where they belong, and they left their wings only, and the wings of love raised up.
I wanted this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born, they felt the last.
Hvg.hu: With what was the most work?
B.Zs.: When music is composed, even with one of them, the hardest pieces have been produced in the mixture.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on a concert wheel, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work grooves, then all the beautiful place was slowly found as in a builder.
hvg.hu: Which track from the new table is your favorite?
B.Z.: This still changes by concertation, and I've already released the table.
Now this is the Prophet is a fool, escape from the Earth and Never The Same.
The traitor risked billions of minorities
Prorad defrau.
This means his fearful employee Jeroma Kerviela French Bank’s gigant Societé General, owner of the Foreign Commercial Bank.
It also came to him for five billion euros.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to compensate his colleagues, and also, absolutely, not able.
In the distance from all the large banking houses, he always recognized the crisis on the American market of hypothecs.
"It's mentally worse," he said from his mouth of the overseers who sent to the police.
But as it comes from Kervie's statement that the French media, such as Le Monde's journal, was it a person who had from his business of profits at the end of the year 1,6 billion euros.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in the statement.
In the summer, he was able to make a half billion euros for the American crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to be reported that the so-called sub-prime hypoteques, provided to the low-premium clients or to those who had a problem with payment in the past, will have problems.
This crisis has no effect on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and put it right.
At the end of the year, his profit was spent up to 1.6 billion euros.
"When I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to tell it," Kerviel admits and adds that he's definitely not left anything for himself.
In the whole hearing, he admits that he has false records so that it does not come to it.
He's even been able to stumble the boss, even when he started his business to take care of the Eurex storm.
The risk was obtained
He was afraid he'd come?
No, no, no, no.
"I thought only the simple fact that I made 1,6 billion for the bank would be satisfied."
Where did he take so many risks?
He had to work gradually in his position.
In 2000, he went to the General Society closely after studying the University in Lyon.
His annual payment moved about $51,000.
In two years later, he was an assistant and in 2005 became a single person with an annual payment of $90,000.
Yet, he said he could never make so much as the rest.
"In my first conversation in 2005, I felt that they were watching me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development," Karviel described researchers.
But soon after the outcome, the first big success arrived.
Thanks to allianz’s actions, he was putting half billion euros at the bomb attacks to London.
And that was the starting mechanism -- he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you.
"It's like a snow ball," said the cops.
But the boss thought about everything or thought.
"When I made money, the eyes were thrown."
Only then, it came to the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euro in one day.
After weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to cold it.
When he came to work on Monday, he wasn't working in the work anymore.
And the bank reported about a few days later that it was about five billion euros.
And how are they coming?
He was suspicious because of his allowance.
"I just chose four days in the next year.
The macker who has no allowance is a man who doesn't want anyone to watch him in his records," Kerviel closed.
Czechland has the chance to get 365 billion
The Government Ministers of the Czech Republic signed with the representatives of the European Commission yesterday with a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can get 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the next years.
It is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
About 125 billion crowns will come from the seven operational programmes to the regions.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will be transported.
Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the PMs that can be obtained from the funds.
These money will increase the budget of the State Fund for transport infrastructure, which will cover a sum of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
Enterprise and innovation programme must serve undertakers and companies to gain innovative enterprises.
Companys should gain funds for the establishment of new areas, for industrial research, but also for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
The EU's funds in the efficiency of money in the newly adopted countries are now part of the CRC in the least successful countries.
Twenty-year-old sentence for the President of Nikaragui confirmed the court
The Court of Auditors in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty-year penalty for the former president of the country Ar ́d Germany, which was sentenced in 2003 for financial undergoing 100 million dollars (without a sum of 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was released and lived in the household at his face nearly nicaraguay metropole.
If some of the heads of this Central American State are returned from 1997 to 2002 to the network, the AP agency is not at this point.
According to the President of the Court of Auditors, Ileany Pérez will now be concerned about the regional factors whether Germany is allowed to execute his penalty at home, or if it is to take advantage of the proceedings.
For four years ago, the court of Germany proved that he regularly moved government money to the accounts of business in Panama.
These companies were fiktiv and the account belonged to its family and nearest staff.
Some of these money were then finished in the fund that Germany founded to finance his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The State budget was accepted.
What is this budget extraordinary?
It is the first budget established by this government and accepted coalition without support of opposition.
The yearly loni passed with the support of the CSSD, because the Minister of Saturday prepared him and the CSSD could not allow his failure.
It has been no dramatic week on this time from the rushing debate before voting on the unbelieving government.
This traditionally overseen, although the most influenced, the Law has approved in peace.
It's a certain paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individuals and budget items, or does not like it to someone.
The start is a major part of the policy, but it is to follow the powerful support of the government with opposition.
This is more medianly thankful, and therefore it is much more attention to him in the media.
A policy request is much more interesting for the public than a high number.
State budgets in the past social democracy governments have suffered from three diseases that are not able to solve once for 2008:
It is a high share of the obligational law, i.e. mandatary expenditure, which are not only income, but also in social doses which have approved the silent "coalice" of CSSD and KSCHM last year before elections.
Two of them are deficit economics as a result of the first disease.
Third limits are the deficiencies of public funds, i.e. the deficit of urban and communal budgets.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the State budget.
It's public and relatively controlled.
However, a timely bomb is deficit of the budgets of cities and communities.
Many careers to obtain other resources for investment, often freely issued obligations to which they deserve their advisory offices, except money, taxes and credits from bank.
In the past years, they were allowed to pay these debts by sale of energy and other divorce networks from the State from privatisation.
They don't have this source now.
We will only keep the official and verifying facts, and we will find out that:
Our economy has spent a few years, as the rest of the world, a growth phase that continues to glorify the CSSD.
It was a unique opportunity to give public funds to its governments.
Instead, however, the state was still worth more.
Other countries, to some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have economyed much more understanding than our Republic.
It's a huge deceit that falls mainly on the past government.
We belong to the countries that are, globally, at least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, there are no needs of massive social programmes that, despite the recent years, have been completely incredible in gigantic dimensions.
Although it has been possible to cancel the part of the insensitive popularist expenditure approved years before elections, so if it is not possible to move the department limit to the penalty and pension reform in the nearby time, then any policy in this country will be completed and any government will only be governed.
With a small extent, it is said that government policies become officials, mechanics dividing the number of money given to revenue and social taxes.
That is why the annual budget of the revolution is not possible, but it can only stop exhausting the normal expenditure in terms of mandatary expenditure.
The planned deficit of 70 billion per 2008 would be completely unfair if the past governments had not been able in the past ten years.
If we don't want the right to happen to the governmental policies, we must be patient and supporting this too strong coalition government, which realizes that the State can educate so much as possible for taxes and payments, peace for the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these will enable the progressive achievement of the balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The United States Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided together to fight against the crisis on financial markets.
In the currency markets, more than $100 billion will be obtained by the currency.
In these banks, they have a rate of interest for which they are willing to pay money.
For example, the American Fed will send to $40 billion, and the additional fourty and fourteen more available European and Switzerland Central.
It is the first time after attacks from 11 September, the central banks of individual States have agreed on such coordinated procedure to prevent or decrease the results of the financial crisis.
"This step has to resolve the largest economic efforts, so the growing lack of freedom that banks could pay," he wrote in his report to Bernard Baumohl from the Advisory Group of the Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks decreased the probability of recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent," added Baumohl in his report.
The banks have already reached $60 billion for unpayed loans, especially in the United States.
Analysis expects more billion losses.
"Center banks must have true fear of what can still follow when they have decided for this process," said ABN Amro Kieran Davies' main economy.
"It seems to be really bad," he added.
The central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also pay their customers.
This would reduce the need and send the American economy into recess with possible impacts on the economic growth of the world.
The central banks decided so after it was not able to reduce the rate of the LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to pay money on the interbank market.
This means that the banks were still concerned about mutual money loan, even though the US, Canada and British Central Banks had decreased their interest rates sometimes.
"It will have the same effect as another reduction of rate rates," said agency Re日s Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analyses do not believe that the step of the central banks contributes to the blessing of the crisis because they do not solve a fundamental problem, and that is the fall of the market in the United States.
Class: Ecological debates are incredible
Global climate changes are most harmful for developing countries.
President Václav Klaus re-employed to the problem of global heating.
The criticism has now come to the end of the international United Nations on climate changes in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his Blue Book, neither the Green Planet, he noticed that ecological debates are incredible.
According to Klause, it is not only acceptable to the structure of the structure of the governments and non-governmental organizations, but also to the main division between the retoric which it is carried out and the reality.
"The work is completely unstructured, it is only a firewall of words that are a recompense for the solution of current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President under the representation of his book highlighted that its subject is very important for them, and therefore it is so involved in them.
He also expressed satisfaction for the fact that the book also appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "I'm sometimes met only with my views."
Now, then, interesters can read his undetected positions.
Klaus recalled that although not the climatologist, he thinks he has enough prejudices to write such a book.
It is the same academic, able to monitor and consider professional negotiations, who has experiences with respect and is also a national ecuator.
The main conclusions of the book indicated that climate is continually changed and its changes are therefore normal that there is no coherent view of all participants that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and serious and thus are not threatening and that the efforts to affect climate development are ineffective, ineffective and inacceptable.
Moreover, as a person with totality experiences, he considers unacceptable introduction of unexpected opinions to others, which feels a dangerous limitation of freedom.
The issues of the present stated repeatedly that it was not against "the reasonable protection of life, but against the military environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
The same theme was Klaus talked in Vienna two months ago at the Hayeck Institute.
The driver couldn't change 600 thousand people.
Seven hundred thousand drivers spent the time and could not change an old driver's evidence, which will expire its validity at the end of the year.
Today, it is the last day when people can ask for exchanges to continue to come to them until the end of the year.
However, the Ministry fears that after the New Year, they would be issued on the road without valid authorisation.
According to the offices, they haven't changed their order mainly those who don't want to run anymore.
While strangers report a decrease in the interest of the driver's exchange, metropolis offices are demanded and the interest of the exchange of shows has increased this week.
The magicist takes about 2000 clients daily.
There's about half a hour in fronts.
The driver's order hasn't changed approximately 140,000 drivers in Prague.
The presentation of a new demonstration takes twenty days.
But it's possible to ask for a decreased period of five days.
In such a case, but the driver's five hundred crowns.
The engineers who owe the exchange of evidence will not reach until the end of the year, and they will go out on the road without a valid driver, will threaten the repentance since January.
The prosecutor will pay for a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But the cops can make a deal with the contract.
In the case of administrative offence, the repentance is exposed to 2500 crowns.
According to the previous information, he could get repentance from the officer and the person who wouldn't go anywhere.
At the same time, it was able to pay 300,000 crowns.
The Ministry first invited the offices to be mild and maintain the highest thousands of circles.
According to Karla Hanzelka's speaker's transport minister, but the tenths of repentance does not threaten anyone.
The leader's evidence is according to the document that people can decide whether they want or not.
It's not a civil proof that everyone has to be valid.
People who don't want to drive have to give a driver's order.
It is sufficient to be taken or sent by a recommended mail to the competent General Authority.
At the end of the year, they will stop paying the orders issued in 1964 to 1993.
Motorists, however, must gradually exchange other types of drivers.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three years of time to exchange.
The validity of evidence issued in 2001 to 2004 shall be terminated in 2013.
According to Hanzelka, about 2.6 million other documents.
The Court decreased the penalties of detectives associated with Berdish
Ancient policeman Joseph Opav and Peter Horses, who are accused of a criminal association with David Berdy's gang, will go to thirteen and ten years of age.
With the definitive in force, the Prague Supreme Court decided to reduce their penalties, one year and two years.
P has threatened the detectives of the Prague Committee for Affairs against organized crime 14 and 12 years.
In contrast with today's decision, it may be only to the Supreme Court of Justice to be revoked.
Although Berdych is also regreted in this box, he's just waiting for the first institution's value.
However, in other processes, he has already received penalties over 16 years.
He can't get more.
In January, the Court recognized, in particular, that 19 guilty persons were insulted, and that the Supreme Court has decided to revoke 16 of them today.
The majority of the accused accusations from the beginning of the investigation refused to refer to the constructed cow.
According to the Mediterranean Senate, police members, after agreement with Berdish, transmitted information from the police resources to criminals, covered individual offences and helped the members of the gang to avoid criminal responsibility.
Gang gave 30 percent for that from the lupe for Opava and the Horse.
Unfortunately, this is the crime of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, the victims who have often suffered a serious health impact, but also the disuse of the power of the public factor and the unleavened weapons.
In the home views, the police also discovered illegally holding guns, shots with the ocean kernel, laser spectator, or self-lamp.
The Gang's accusation, he's coming on a decade of million crowns.
Furthermore, twenty men in this process have already been authorised by the judges to be guilty of the other Berdish and a number of others.
Other men around Berdish are still talking before the court in another process, some of the cases have not yet been voted before the court.
The vote was then revoked to Tomás Poto and Maroshi Schuley, who died in the Irish liaison, where they waited for a definitive decision on their issue to move to the Czech Republic.
Country for replacement of children: 12 million
For the replacement of children in the family, the lawyer of the damaged families Igor Veleba wants 12 million coron, plus court exhibition.
For each of the mothers of three million, for fathers by two million, and for children by a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The Representative of the Hospital of Ondréy Dotto, therefore, does not generally agree with Veleby.
"That's the request we refuse, it's very high," said the Doctor after today's negotiation.
"And they could have made a view of the contrary, we've made a famous case that the contrast had made it.
Let's find out if he has a corresponding value at all.
But we're maintaining in the view that it will be in statistics for everyone," Dostal highlighted.

The powder came about the Kingdom of Valash
Polyvka has lost a lot of the markup of the Valash Kingdom.
According to the Court of Justice of the Islamic Court, the king of Wales first used the name, but the project was building a yearly working team around Tomás Harabish, who was cooperating with the herd.
The polymer hasn't participated in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, but the cup is probably not finishing and the client's calling.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabish and his team are parasitting on the popular Bolka Polívka," the lawyer said after the process of Polyvkov.
According to the words of the Valash Kingdom, everyone will save just herd and comic.
The same opinion has Harabish.
"There's a decade job behind us.
Covering money and thinking of actions," he said.
According to the fact, there's a problem of money.
"In years, they realized that the project was successful and could have something from it.
They want to parasit our job," he added.
Lucrative Business
According to the Court of Justice, the king of Wales first used Polyvk in his television order.
In 1993, her coronated her Herc Radoslav Brzobogati.
But then it did not have the intention of building ficticial kingdom.
Over a few years later, Harabish came with the idea of issue of Valley passports.
From the p'regressive action, trade and lucracy was devoted to the business activity which Harabish then called for the detention of the Walesian Kingdom.
In 1997, Polyvka agreed with the introduction of his name and signature in the pastures and even offered their sleeve holders in visiting his farms and divorce representations.
Who's sitting on the throne?
The Court also stated that Harabish only used a hole idea that Polyvka published in Manegi for his business purpose.
"Popularity Boleslava Polevka's project of the Valash Kingdom has certainly helped," said the judge.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team, which intensely intensified him.
The cooperation of the disappointed parties today continued until 2000, when Harabish organized the official coronation in the Centre of Polish.
Since that time, however, between Poland and Harabish, they have started to cross the consequences that have made the meetings of the "King of Boleslava I. chosen for furt".
Then the ruler of the kingdom took the song Jarmila Shulak as a king's mother in the south of Harabish.
In 2002, Polívka submitted to Harabish and his company the claim that the court has refused today.
Clearly, Harabish could bring to the dispute a delayed clothing on the throne and half of the princess.
The new king should go out of it.
Details and termin's not yet wanted to proclaim.
"We don't want anything to succeed.
It should be something like the king's leader in Slovakia.
The king should be released for a certain time.
Even Mr. Polívka can be quietly registered," added Harabish.
Test Peugeotu 207 SW 1.6 VTi: monthly prejudice
Really, I never found too much Peugeoto 206.
His leading properties were nothing too much, the quality of order, management, and also the production would be marked as a subsequent.
But on the market is now a representative of Peugeot 207, and he's a lot better.
And the truck called SW is still about a bit further and I'm not left to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback of Peugeoto 207, for example, I moved to space on the back side.
This is already the end, because the carrosure of the truck means that they will suffer in this direction or two-meter length.
The World’s Flight
Inside, I'm going to pass very much so I can't repeat too much.
It's a total design, where I have the only outcome to the poor central tunnel.
Here I'd appreciate something more designer invention when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are pleasant and those are the times when we could move to short seats or seats.
The side management has also improved explicitly against model 206.
Whatever in the space, it's also here to feel the growth of the carosure dimensions.
Then, in the truck, the lack of space is already mentioned above the head.
Cooking coffee
So the main thing on this vehicle is his complainant.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (and also thanks to the back window) and as a perfectly compliance.
The loud places are equipped with retaining gums, which are the ideal compromise.
It doesn't prevent, it will be spread, and then will maintain more difficult objects.
But let's stop over the volume together.
This is based on a table of 428 l, which is more than a average value against competition.
However, not against the most selling vehicle in Czechland - Fabia Combi's damage.
If we compare 207 SW with the new generation of the youthboleslave product, then we will find that Peugeot remains a lot of known 52 litres.
This value shall be critical for the allowed in the ship or when the cup is loaded.
But if I had to raise up the positive, I still have to mention the entirely equal ground after the second row or very low desire.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a firewall of 1,6 l with 88 kW.
And to say the truth, that's how a sixteen-family haachback looks like.
She's quiet, she's a little need, and she's primarily dragging.
It's compared to the damage period that leckdy acts as if she had a shocked hair in the output, so I can only be overcome.
The price will be depreciated
The price of the car is not human.
However, we need to remember that we tested the properly equipped car with a space-in-law and a very good engine.
The basic price of the vehicle with the fourteenth floor at 329 900 Kč is still running.
Our add is 410 900 Kč, which is enough.
The tested equipment of Premium will then be eligible for other 80 000 Kč plans.
Because we still had head airbags, automatic climate, automatic launch of drivers, electric control of back windows...
Just the car stands over all 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but count your additional equipment at Fabie and you'll get to a lot similar number.
So it's not left until you decide for a tag.
The integration of the Slovenian jackets at the British Schools is not done
At the British schools, children from Eastern Europe, which calls anxiety for the further development of local education in local residents.
The integration of the High-Europeans is still a series of interruptions.
The British Schools even register cases where the conflicts between the movers and the children of the pools are overwhelmed in violence.
The problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe at British schools illustrates the case in North Kentu, where they begin to deal with conflicts between local residents and Slovenian attendants.
Heavy, scarlets and scarlets have also been transferred to the relationship between parents.
The situation went so far that she arrested a Slovenian woman in Chatham's police, who was driving a 10-year-old boy.
She prevented the boy from hurt her with racists.
The police had to include two native girls in the Slovenian mover.
The girls of men have probably participated with racist comments and were thrown into stones.
"When we went home, a boy spent the bus stop and started flying on us.
When I told him to leave it, he burned on us the eggs and the goats, and then discovered his back," she described another unfair income for the Times' mother of Slovenia's jaws.
Difficulties are both sides.
One of the local residents even signed a partnership with Eastern Europe for the fight for survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere at the British schools between local and inhabitants begins to be picked.
In British, 70 thousand Slovaks are registered to work here.
Some 30 thousand Slovenian boys then visit British schools.
Cuba the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
The island of freedom is true for visits.
Whatever you expect from your allowed, it can be fulfilled if you choose right.
Gold and white beaches, high waves, or sea, quiet as a fisherman.
Palms and all included with cocktails, offering on the beach of pizza, frozen and cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and ruleta.
On the Caribbean Islands, you will find it in a complete and even richer account.
Only on one island, but you'll find much more, and the island is Cuba, the biggest and beautifulst of the Great Antil.
After Spain, Cuba was the garden of their inhabitants in America.
Columbus marked her as the most beautiful place that human eye ever saw.
Havana became the storage and translation of the stocks that Spanish in America have attached and transferred to Europe.
And then the American era came.
Hotel Nacional has grown at the end of 20 years.
He allowed him to set up one of the American Mafia Boss Lucky Luciano, because everything that was in the United States crime (in particular the foreground) was welcomed and supported in Cuba with drugs, hazard, prostitution.
Among his guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Hawaii, high houses were grown, after wide bottles, cars were driven, which belonged to the symbols of the culture of the past 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a residence in San Francisco de Paula, a bit from Havana, and in Coyemar he had his jachto.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, they left their signatures of the showbusiness star and politicians from all America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Haven Bodeguite, you can leave your autogram too.
In a nice hotel bar, the Nationals have a cocktail for your desire.
And these 50-year-old cars are running to Hawaii, because sometimes imported bullets and fiates in that salt and low air have been smoking for a long time.
It's Havan, especially her oldest part, very discovered, but there's nowhere in the surroundings so beautiful colonial memories as right there.
Other places also change in niceness, perhaps Trinidad.
Since the movement offers so much money, its development has green.
In the past 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadar, in Holguin province, and in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another library that is unique in the world and appreciates it, in particular, by the lobsters.
A wheat of the diluted plants was weakened into sugars after heavy rows of pars and motor bottles.
Their vehicle park has not been renewed for many decades, so there are functioning machines whose layers are elsewhere in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous place of visits of Kuby's no mine.
And so about Varada, or about Havana, it's not too much to write up.
I hope just note that in the already mentioned place of Hemingway is a museum and who has this writer should not let him go.
The valley of Viňales One of the most smallest angles of Cuba is the valley of Viňales on the west of the island.
The gross vegetation grows from the vacuum base.
The potatoes, wapening homosexuals and rocks rise from the bottom of the valley, and in their dusts the vegetable winters have been captured, thus also the wind scale covered by a hot cross.
The valley is the place where the most qualitative Cuban tabac is growing.
With his final likeness, you can meet if you visit some of the Hawaii factories for the production of researchers.
Maybe somebody's gonna be interesting and that the Chile part of the Zeman's landscape is there.
Trinidad
An ancient city, which was founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the islands.
He brought his glory and riches to the trade with slaves and sugar.
Richness turned into the beauty and splendidness of a small city.
The Colonial Spanish tecnology, which has been significantly affected by further French sentences, has not changed in terms of four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountain of Escambray, is so remote that in the past 50th century there was no road that would connect the country to the rest of the country.
The isolation helped him stay on the side.
Nothing happened there, and that's why nothing happened, everyone was not going to have a shot over his head.
If a person in Trinidad has more time than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the nearby area, such as Play Ancón beach, or Sucrovar valley.
After night, it belongs to enter the Casa de la Musica, who lives after sharing and music in it rejoices over the.
Baracoa
The city on the east of Cuba some are the most beautiful in the island.
In fact, such views are already affected by the way itself.
Both roads that go from Guantanama must overcome the high and the mountain members and run by the nature that human activity has not mentioned.
The County island of Cuba wrote UNESCO thanks to the dark uninterrupted nature on the list of world inheritance.
They do the best chocolate there, in the church of May Ko's cross (in Ânosti appeared about a hundred years after Columbo's flood) and from the copper where there is some of the towns and today's hotel El Castillo, is to see a number of table mountains, of whom the most famous is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, scientists, the mountain of Sierra Maestra, the Mountain of Sweet and the island of Issa de Pinos, the cabarot of Tropican, the sanctuary of the Cuban Patronic Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions, which recognises the descendants of some of the slaves, all of this would be described.
But as it's right, it's better to see one time.
Associations in Afghanistan are pass.
A few soldiers and the lack of needed equipment affect the progress of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
The NATO, according to the Defence Minister Robert Gates, should plan a specific plan for the next year.
The missing in Afghanistan does not make the idea, the representatives of the countries in Scotland Edinburgh who have units in the southern part of the country agreed.
According to a growing opposite from the Taliban movement, eight participated States today also discuss other plans and coordination of associates.
While the United States this week by the Defence Minister of Robert Gatese called NATO units for more activity, Great Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authorities of the Afghanistan and strengthening development assistance.
"The wheat in Afghanistan is mature, but the military force can only be one part of the solution.
The next is to enable the people to start further economic and security development," the British Defence Minister Des Browne station BBC said.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghanistan rebels has been highest than the last five years, according to the American Army's data.
The beginning of violent actions was 27 per cent over the past year, even 60 per cent in the southern province of Helmand.
The NATO land has approximately 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, from which about a quarter in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the units have reached the same limit in the organization and equipment.
They particularly ask for further helicopters, soldiers and experts for the train of Afghanistan units.
"We'll have to think seriously about specific objectives for the next time and how to achieve them," said Gates.
In a similar sense, the general secretary of NATO Jaap de Hoop has also spoken today.
"I'm glad of what we have in Afghanistan on earth and air.
We have approximately ninety percent of soldiers and equipment that they needed, and that's a little bit," said Agent Re日s De Hoop to the conclusion of three-day conversations with the Japanese Government in Tokyo.
Who's the passion?
Among the countries involved in the past months, there have also been conflicts on whether all associates in Afghanistan are maximized.
For the passion, for example, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans have a relatively numerous representation in Afghanistan.
But they are placed in the areas where the minimum victory is and the fighting charges on them are not as high as we are in the south and east part of the country," said Gates.
The British Sun bulvary magazine this week marked German soldiers for lenses.
"Afghanists discovered: Germans play, while our guys fight," Sun wrote in the material, supplemented photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Image passed into the anti-attachment and printed the British unit's photo at the ragby bathroom in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will be exhausted for billion in 2009
Each Czech is a State debt over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt reached the end of September to 842,7 billion crowns.
The government planned for the year to pay 159,2 billion crowns.
At the beginning, however, the Ministry decreased the plan to 152,8 billion crowns through the improved development of the state budget.
The State debt of the Czech Republic reached the end of September to 842,7 billion crowns.
In nine months of the year, the crown increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, the crown was decreased by 13,4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance has so confirmed its state debt data today from the beginning of October.
Each Czech seems to be a debt over 84,000 crowns.
Over the whole year, he has been charged for more than 111 billion crowns.
"In time, it seems that the limits of a billion crown could be overcome by lower deficit for the next year until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be moved between 900 billion and a billion crown," iHNed.cz analytic Patria Finance David Marek said for the server.
Similarly, the analysis of Next Finance Vladimir Pikora sees: "To overcome a billion, they could be reached during 2009.
When exactly it will depend on the next budget that we don't know yet.
If the political scene changed, the policy would be willing to see more, it could be moved to 2010.
But I don't assume this change," he said.
Debts Gross
The State debt constitutes the debt of the central government and results in primarily the cumulation of State budget stages.
The State debt shall be financed by post-instructions, state debts, direct loans or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the State was 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns for a year.
The debt of the State has grown by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called State debt at the end of September reached 803,3 billion crowns and from June decreased 13,7 billion crowns.
The average debt of the State debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt for the first to the third quarter increased by 13 percent, which is very much about how economically it is.
Interestingly, growth is mainly generated in debt, where 20 percent growth is.
It's bad that the debt grows, but on the other hand it shows that it's going to trade with when the revenue reform is here," Pikor's data commented.
Better than expected
The 2007 financing and management strategy shows that the government planned to pay 159,2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning, however, the Ministry decreased the plan to 152,8 billion crowns through the improved development of the state budget.
The part of the State budget's deficit, which, of course, will reach 76 billion coroners in place of 91.3 billion coroners.
The following is the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency 13,3 billion crowns, the 10 billion reserve for income payments, the financing of State debts for 43 billion crowns and loans from the European Investment Bank in 1.8 billion crowns.
The woman has to be delivered to the court in Charthoume today because she has given the name of the black-shirt.
The British teacher, sentenced in Sudan for the wound of Islam, was sentenced by one Chartum Court on Thursday evening to the 15-day proceedings and dismissed, as the lawyer said.
British was accused that she had left six to seven years old age to give to the mosquito name Mohamed despite any vision of the prophet of Islam is prohibited.
She was detailed by the wound of the wheat.
This 14-year British teacher, acting on the University High School in the Southern Chart, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of the injury of Islam and Rebelia, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudan Criminal Law, after the parents of several fathers had been charged with the Soviet Ministry of School.
Our story begins in a month of September when the teacher concerned requests his six to seven years of age to choose a name for a classic glass mixture.
"From the mouth of the child there are eight names, including Hasan, Abdulah and Mohamed," says the director of the school Robert Boulos.
After voting in the class, 20 of 23 children will finally choose as the favorite name of Mohamed.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but mostly it is a very extensive name of the Baptist in Sudan.
Children then created a book for their class with a powder with the letter "My name is Mohamed".
He himself had no shadow on himself with this name, but in the vision of the prophet that was considered as a wrath to Islam.
One of the Muslims, Giannan Gibbons, who teaches in the same school in Sudan, explained that she knows well and that she would never do anything that could be harmful for any religious faith:"I'm sorry only that she asked the kids to vote for a fair name," it is according to it only for "unclean doubts".
Such views also divide many artists who describe it as "very careful to their fathers" and adds that "never talks about religion in class".
Remember that the baptism name Mohamed is also the second most often made Christian name in British, which is written in English in fourteen different ways.
This Christian name often selected by Muslim families represents a way to worship the prophet (frequently given to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this Christian name?
For example, is it possible to give them to players?
Of course, it's a question of interpretation.
On the last round of negotiating this center in Vienna, they did not agree on the future status of the province.
Finally failed.
The Serbian and Kosovo Albanians ended in the middle of the average in the Russian Baden sixth and the last round of the discussions, unless they were able to overcome distant views on the future status of this separatist province.
"It is political that both parties were not able to reach the status agreement," stated the European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger during the printing in Vienna.
His American prosecutor, Frank Wisner, highlighted that peace in the world is "in the square" and called for Belgrade and Pristina to take care of their commitments to keep peace and were also ready for dialogue after the end of negotiation.
"We don't expect violence at the nearest time, but we're going into a period of time," he added, "It's evident that the drinking is.
The negotiation ends 10.
Consequently, the negotiators of the Troyka, composed of the representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be reported to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province where 90 per cent constitutes Albanian speaking population, it could be shown in a clearer light to 10th, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko has to deal with the United Nations Security Council.
The discussions in Baden, near Videna, represent the sixth and the last trip of negotiation since the United Nations, in August this year, has conferred on the new negotiation.
The Americans and Europeans calculate that the debates will be completed in 10th.
The Russians who have already blocked the grant of Kosovo independence in the United Nations Security Council, rather than continued the negotiation after this most determined term.
"Russian was and remained attached to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Bocan-Chartchenko.
A single-side statement of independence?
After eight years of administration of the international community, the West considers the independence of Kosovo under the supervision of the EU as the only appropriate solution.
The Pristina states that if the Security Council does not decide in its benefits, the independence is prepared to declare one-sidely.
The whiteground's on an expanded autonomy.
"Therefore, we haven't reached any agreement," reported the president of the Kosovo self-sufficiency Fat_Seidiu at the research hotel, where this "latter chance" has been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, the former rebellious commander of the Kosovo Albanians and the future Prime Minister of the province, expressed compassion.
However, he added that the plan of autonomy represented by Belgrade is "the past that led to murder and deportation".
"Dominal Effect"
In contrast, Serbian President Boris Tadić believes that the compromise is still being taken into account and warned the Albanian population in Kosovo from an investigation of the unilaterally stated independence of the province.
The Belgrade is, in particular, fearing the "domen effect" in a ›i, which is still stablishable during wars for independence in the 90s.
"For Serbia, however, it doesn't mean it," he said, "the compromise is impossible."
On Wednesday, the Serbian delegation held that all decisions would be exclusively subject to the Security Council in which its Russian association had the right of vet.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia is only acceptable to the Security Council's solution," stated Serbian Prime Minister Voijslav Koštunica.
"That's been two years.
It must end as she started: on the ground of the Security Council."
The journalists Fatschiu replied that "the last word of the status will be held by the Kosovo Parliament" and added that if there was a single statement of independence from the Albanian speaking people, "with the west" would run.
Bush made an agreement with the Israelites and the Palestinians
At the start of the International Peace Police in Maryland approved from his post, the American President George Bush announced that the Israelites and the Palestinians finally agreed on a common declaration.
He noted that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas agreed on the immediate initiation of negotiations with an intention to solve 60 years of conflict between both nations.
In the presence of both Bush men, he promised that he would do everything in order to help them close the "Peace with" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must associate with colonial activities, announce Bush and remember the obligations for both parties from the "way of map" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The leader of the White House stressed that the negotiation between Israel and the Palestinian self-sufficiency led by Abbas has the goal of "closing the peace with which would still resolve all unresolute issues without exception, which is, of course, the issues of the centres".
This statement includes three issues that are in the nuclear conflict between Israel and the Palestinians: the future border of the Palestinians, the status of Jerusalem and the decree of arabic flights expired during the conflict in 1948 from their homes in the country of today Israel.
Abbas took the words from the American President and focused on the following action "total and reasonable" and to touch all aspects of the solution, by changing "Jerusalem, fugling, border, colony, water, security, otherwise".
Then Olmert came to the Court, who said that the next negotiation should be "right and continual" and that "required to be closed in 2008".
Bush appointed the end of 2008 as a term of its "visual of two states", Palestinian and Israeli, existing around him.
The Saudi Arabia has made the fact that Bush has taken a commitment in this sense even before she decided to take place.
Saudi Arabia, whose prosperity in the Police is successful for Washington, initiated us accepted by all Arab countries, which offers Israel a peace exchange for abandoning all Arab territory prohibited for war in 1967, in particular the East Jerusalem.
Polis means "the crossing in the Middle East, especially because he fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", judges Prince Saudi in interview, which offered to one Arabic speaking journal protected by the Saudian.
According to the prosecutors, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As this is in such small reports from black chronics, the official versions do not agree with what is spoken between people.
What are the circumstances of accidents?
According to the first results of the investigation General Inspection of French State Police (Inspection General de la police national, IGPN), the police car passed on Sunday shortly after 17 hours of Louise-Michel Street in the foreign of Villiers-le-Bel.

The green motocycle of the Kawasaki mark, "not registered, and therefore without permission to drive to public communications" (read below), driven by two young people without adjunction, passed "very high."
"The motorcycle dropped on the left side to the police car after he had no preference to the right," said one policeman.
The test of alcohol mixture in the blood carried out on the vehicle holder was negative.
The state of the car (prospered front, dispersed front glass, broke wrappers) testifies of the frequency of the pressure.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (Republique de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry reacted very well yesterday and told that the IGPN had granted an investigation of "inconscient killings and non-profit for people in threats", who is also addressed by the Departmentale de la Safeté du Val-d'Oise (Direction of the National Police department Val'Oise).
In the event of the afternoon, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, in this stage, the responsibility of police for accident.
Three witness accidents that were detailed on Sunday evening, according to the office, confirmed "the version of the police, which is that the minimum engine approached them relatively to the left."
As a rice, without doubt caused by the third climb on the ground, yesterday, she showed that the two vehicles remained inclined to the moment when the police car was able to sound.
The vehicles were ensured and they're going through the technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were made a drink yesterday.
What happened immediately?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, the people have spread the story that the police should leave the place of action without providing two young people the first help.
The IGPN should also, in all caution, exclude "every serious prosecution" in this point.
"It is a more urgent aspect of investigation which requires more controls and which must be very careful with," the police resource.
The "Libération" journal met the clear witness of those moments followed after a accident.
One of his windows, then, leads directly where the accident was played.
"We are immediately with the sister who is a health sister in the hospital, running down and trying to resurrect them," says the witness.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he looked at a bully, totally scared policeman.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young people and the fourth talked to the phone."
The faces in the face of the growing pressure and certainly present that youths are unnatural, the police were taken from the cars of colleagues who have reached the place.
According to the same witness, the relief reached "approximately twenty minutes after the police went out."
They also made the heart massage, but they're missing.
"Let nobody claim that the police authorities did not help young people.
These youths were given the first help.
The Hassici's arrived immediately.
The prosecutor highlighted that everything was done for their salvation.
Stress in Pakistan grows
The Pakistan police took the first demonstration on Monday from the statement of the exceptional state by General Musharaf, two days ago.
In Lahor, on the east of the country, approximately 2000 lawyers demonstrating the measures adopted in the exceptional state, granates with grass gas were hurt, which, according to witnesses, used the order forces.
The last names answered by stones that some of the police were hurt.
At least 350 lawyers were called.
Similar scenarios as in Karacchi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and hurt lawyers.
Some of them should have been called.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court called for the General Staff and reported demonstrations, as a result of about five hundred opponent arrests, fights for human rights and lawyers during the weekend.

More than the third pregnancy still creates pregnancy unexpectedly
This budget includes unexpected pregnancy (24 %) as well as badly planned or unexpectedly established.
More than one pregnancy of three (36%) is still unexpected today, studies conducted by the French Institute national d'études demographiques (Ined)- State Demographic Studies Institute, forty years after the adoption of Neuvirth's law, which has made anticoncepts in France.
This budget includes unexpected pregnancy (24 %) as well as badly planned or unexpectedly established.
Different anticonceptive methods of hormonal anticonception or sterilisation are still shown by 5% to 6% of the insufficiency level, Ined is estimated.
However, the anticonceptive law only enabled a better "fruit control", confirms the establishment and notes that the rate of use of hormonal anticonception in women between 20 and 44 years has been 60% in 1970.
Finally, eight of the ten children are well planned today.
One of the five has even been calculated for a month exactly and if it is in the jack that is considered as the most pleasant annual period for the birth of a child.
Watchful systems of the space station
More than seven hours of work in the universe needed astronaut Scott Parazynski and its members from the International Universal Station (ISS) to observe the broken solar panel, which is necessary for the next deal of the station.
There was a risky output into the universe, which collected records in terms of duration, distance from resident modules, ≥ the measurement of "coating" which astrons have been charged in reality.
Problems occurred on Wednesday, while astronomy from Discovery's ship exposed the Harmony module, a great warrior for the installation of European and Japanese laborers (see footnote).
This module is an adjusting mole for modules-laborators.
But you must be able to resource electricity.
The second task of the station was, therefore, to move the seventeenth floor module that produces electricity using solar panels, which was already placed on the ISS, so that it was covered on its final set.
After she moved her, the property began to expand the seventy-six meters solar panels of the module.
And there was one of the panels that set up as a sticking harmonic, in the course of the cabell's grip, damaged on the surface of a metro freedom.
The discharge was stopped to prevent the further damage of the panel.
Astronomy, who had to carry out a control output on the Discovery ship, and followed to perform another solar panel, whose rotation system had an injury, were required to join the damaged panel.
And it was just Scott Parazynski, who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic brain of the ship, added to the station, and performed the order.
It's one of the best "spacewalkers" (a peaceful chodec) of the American Airport and University Agency (NASA).
High, powerful, very rotated, has a very developed hole and a long pair.
In his 46 years, this pharmaceutical appointment has been conferred by the doctor to "operate" the "injured" solar panel.
After a detailed investigation of damage, he cut off the cab and spake to the damaged place of some "dlahy".
He helped him the second "spacewalker", who stayed near the compensation com, as well as inside, the final astronautes, including Peggy Witson, the commander's officer.
The tools that he used, namely the minihokeeca, with a beautiful isolation, to protect the electric shock on solar panels that produce a few hundred volts, found and produced astrons on the station floor.
After the operation ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely distributed and then spent his tools and returned to the internal station.
Last afternoon, astrons enjoyed a sudden rest before today, when seven astronauts return to Discovery ship to return to the Middle, as planned, to the Earth.
EADS actions are weak
The EADS action will lose more sensitively on the Paris Burge, after this company operating in the aircraft and defense industry noted that it would have to lose 1,2 to 1,4 billion euros to delay the A400M airport.
EADS lost 4% and now it is 21,96 euro in Paris's village.
The financial group was required to re-evaluate its proposed production results for 2007 as a result of subsequent delays before the development of A400M aircraft, which is a submining year of starting.
The price for late delay in the delivery of military cost airports, reported in October, was calculated "1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, from more than billion airbuss", reported the European EADS mother company.
For the purposes of these costs, the EADS will, on Thursday, be required to report a new view of profits before the rate and tax collection (EBIT).
The group also indicated that the new estimate of costs corresponds to six months late.
Remember that the EADS production results in 2006 fell by 86 %, especially because of the costs associated with the latest of another programme, which is A380 airport.
The P group assumed that the first airport of A400M to the French Army would be delivered in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
Saturday options will be running without expectation: The Russian will choose the side of President Putina, the United Russia.
Confirming that, after the end of only a few free pre-election campaigns, their movement to stability, rather than autority.
Today, three days ago before elections in the lawyer office, the Russian President Vladimir Putin will communicate to the electors in public laws a predicted television message, which, however, has been held secretly.
It does so from the position of the United Russia leader, the procreme party, which, according to all, celebrates the victory.
When he accepted the prominence of foreign states yesterday, the president of the State did not let anything come out and satisfied the next attack on the West accused of mixing - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of the right democracy and we take the honourable, which may be the most transparent and uninternated options, choices without self-minded beauty," he added.
In the eyes of opposition to it isn't far away.
They condemn the campaign known by different pressures.
The Communists leader Gennadij Zjuganov says "never has been taking such a choice, neither for Jelcina."
Following the repressions of demonstrations from the last week, the former world master in the Garry Kasparov Shach, sentenced for five days of illegal demonstration, has continued, according to his lawyers, to the prohibition of visits.
"Russians remained mental homo sovietica"
In the background of the following parliamentary elections of simplified expectations, two far more open questions are profiled:
- "Who will become the Representative of Putin in the presidential office?
The Official Journal of yesterday has published the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; public candidates may be represented until 23.
Vladimir Putin, chosen in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot strive for the third mandate in order.
Nevertheless, no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be the Prime Minister?
Or the leader of the parliamentary and the Almighty Party of the United Russia who chooses the government and the president?
Whether or not, the removing government power will win over all lines in Parliaments, as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russian mentality remained homo sovietic, it doesn't feel to be the masters of his judgment," he believes the sociolog Lev Bogkov, the director of the independent center of Levada.
History Nikolaj Koposov from the State University in Sankt-Peterburg is all of the most remote relationships: the civil society has taken up, in this country, five centuries after Europe, a delay; the glorious common spirit has lately created individualism.
After liberal reforms of the nineteen years, "Putin called on the patriarchal model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, rather than that this new patternism did not cause terror, but a certain economic welfare," Mary Lipman from Carnegie's opinion.
The Russians today "freely delivered the personal responsibility" which they shortly showed after the SSSR division.
"How do you think?"
This phenomenon is related to all the communities, including the commercial world.
The official elite also aims to maintain status quo: 65 persons (of the total number of 85 leaders of Russian regions) are conducting local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from Western are often like in the nineteen years, a synonym of chaos.
Public opinions give priority to stability.
Moreover, in the name of the stability, the Russians will choose extremists.
Conclusion Tamary Čeredniczko, fourteen-year-old professor: "How to think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why do they change?"
Hard Memory
After more than sixty years in the confidential regime, Nazis of Bad Arolsen, which counts the sentences of 17,5 million of Hitler's regime victims, are deployed by the public.
47 million of documents recorded at the length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were accessible only for "humanitary" at this time, which means individually and in particular, on request of former victims or its legal persons.
The eleven states conferred on the management of the States - among whom Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to their discovery to the doctors and historians.
Since the process of settlement of this Agreement is at the end of all States, the opening of yesterday has been purchased.
Sensitive information
The free access of stories to Bad Arolsen will be enabled to examine "in particular the movement of the camps, the population of the camps and the health status of the employees," explains Reto Meistern, Director of these species managed by the International Red Croix-rouge Committee (CCR).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were against the accession of these named public documents, due to the sensitive consideration of certain information.
What homosexuality or mental placement of some deportation victims are supposed.
The records of concentration camps or hosts composed by Gestape were recorded after the war to find deported or necessary civil citizens in detail, providing evidence of their internation to open their way of damage.
More than 300 persistent employees in Bad Arolsen still have tens of individual demands.
However, for the part of the community, the access to Bad Arolsen is only a detailed contribution.
"Nothing of these documents can't be expected primarily," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Antisemitism of the Berlin Technical University in 2006.
The EU and India want to aim on free trade in 2008
Currently, the bilateral trade between Europe and India has already reached 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is the first trade partner in India in order and represents 18 % of its business.
The European Union and India expected in 2008 a signature of free trade, reported by the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian adversary Kamal Nath.
In April the previous year, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the EU gave the Green Commission to initiate negotiations with the purpose of signing the free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Associations of Southeast Asia (Asia). The billet trade between Europe and India is now a 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is the first trade partner in India in order and represents 18 % of its business.
The EU is also its first investor, but, according to the European Commission, India is the nineth EU trade partner.
"The Free Trade Agreement is extremely covered by both economics" and "India will get a better access to the market of 450 million prospering Europeans," Peter Mandelson added.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten exported products of India, explained by the European Commissioner. The Asian and European Gigant amends "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services", declared this week, the leader of the delegation of the European Commission in the New Dilli, which claims that the bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential. The EU and India are meeting on the eightth joint diplomatic sum in New Dilly, for the president of Manmohan Singha and the President of the European Commission of José Manuel Durao Barrosy.

UMP (Union for un movement populaire, Union for human movement) and NC (New Centre, New Centre) are refused to deal with socialists (PS) on purchaseability
The UMP clubs and New Centers refused to discuss the individual paragraphs of socialistick law on purchaseability, which is equal to refusing the text.
On the agenda, the text of the law was received in the context of the socialistick "nizd" (meeting initiated by a single colleague club) and contained ten measures adopted on Wednesday Presidency of the PS, including 50 % increased employment premium, renewal of TIPP, transport check or payment regulations.
Since the UMP and NC voted against the negotiation of individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was completed after the general debate, which was the opportunity to exchange opinions, sometimes liver, between the opposite and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's negotiation on the purchaseability.
The PS Chairman Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will repeat these claims in their completeness in the form of amending the Financial Act, which Snemvna will negotiate next week.
The new festival is born.
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents in Filadelfia established a new festival, this promotor/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey reported in collaboration with the British Republic of Melvina Benna.
"For our company, it is the honour to work with a person who has inspired the current festival movement in America without fail," Charlie Jones from the C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 produces a Chicago festival of Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey's state is an aerial campaign station.
The Festival should run from 8 to 10 August to a private farm with 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Filadelfia.
Director of the festival of the Republic, I know before Mean Fiddler, one of the world's most famous festival agents.
In 1989, reading Festival was taken in the United Kingdom, which annually attached to 80,000 people.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his portfolio Leeds Festival, and in 2006 Festival Festival founded Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
It begins in 2002, Melvin Benn, as a companion, also has the care of production, licence and organizational tasks at Glastonbury Festival, which has a capacity of 177 500 people today.
Charlie Jones from C3 calls Glasstonbury as a "neinspirative event" that he has ever experienced and says that his company and company Melvina Benna are working together in order to give the region a festival event of Europe.
"We have chosen Philadelphia as a market, and together with Fairmount Parks Commission, we have worked separately and have founded a festival in the Centre of Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"I agreed with the city and the Commission was motivated and overcome from the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the current chairmanship of the city, we have put into politics, Charlie Jones adds.
"Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we wanted to establish a great festival on a exceptional place that will then serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents in 2005 raised the Lollapaloos festival in the Chicago Grant Park, after 2002 they came on the festival scene of Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The gross markets made $9.8m and $11.3m for 2007.
Both of these festivals are running in the city.
"The European Model of Melvina Benna's festival is playing on the outside, while our festivals rather run in Green places in towns," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to deal with the right way of both captures so, and they have created as the idea of the foreign festival by Europe and by the city by the America."
Vineland is located about half the way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Obec Vineland, of course anxiety, supports the success of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The final appointment refuses to translate submissions to the agreement, however, states, "they are sufficiently useful to allow investment in such events and to welcome the festival that will have, hope, long-term."
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will catch 80,000 people.
It says that calls have already been sent to groups, however, nothing can be confirmed at the time when the programme is already printed.
"Vineland will have a rock-speak, but music will be there, and if my spectrum is attached to the wide spectrum of the walls," says Carlie Jones.

Montreal Chile to Terminator
It's not easy to join Hollywood film studies in Montreal when the Terminator himself stands against it...
This convinced mission is one of the delegate's tasks.
His mandate, however, is "politically proud" because the California Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to fall "Governator"?
"It must be cautious, it's an idea who decides where he's going.
If he thinks the submins in Montreal are positive, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those that they will consider as the best," he said.
Conjunction for festivals
For this moment, however, Denise Turcotte's priority is the promotion of the local movie.
She's already started a hung for Oskary.
At all the festivals of the Western Coast, whether the festivals are in Sundance, Denver, Seattla or San Francisco, it is about to present chebec movies, to warn them and to ensure that the registers provide conversations.
Darkness had a few weeks a good publicity at Mill Valley Film Festival 30th year ago.
It will be represented at Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is in the offer in Santa Monice and will be presented in November on the 30th anniversary Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month Quebec also presented four shortcommetrations and four whole evening films on the American Film Institute Fest.
Will it come at the end of the year on the marathon bar? Experts divided the 'subpresse' crisis.
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administration year, and the investors already have my hands expected to reach traditional marathon at the end of the year.
However, experts are not so sure this year.
Bank Banif believes that "in statistical view, a month's moon has to put the progress on the burst."
However, it is not appropriate to create a claim exclusively based on the particularly because they report, at least short-term, certain doubts in the current market relations."
These experts do not assume that the storm has been moved in the past weeks, and they note that "burzo's market is maintaining the existence of liquidity that is prepared to invest as a result of lacking alternatives with guarantees, especially the strong income affected by the effect of the return to quality value papers, as well as in short-terms".
That is why I believe that the storm will have more peaceful progress, neither without volatility, "over because the impact of the potential fall of the FED tax (Fuelal Reserve System), in view of the high level of the greenhouse prices and the risk of inflation pressure."
Javier Barrio, the leader of the BPI banks in Spain, agrees that it is not the right moment for a courageous statement that it will come to marathon.
"There's not too much for joy," this expert assures.
Ibex lost at least 4 % of the maximum values referred to on November 8, when the index closed to 15 945.7 points.
However, all experts do not have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analytic, believes Ibex 35 could end a year about more than 16,000 points through the transcoup of the portfolio and traditional pension income to the pension insurance that comes annually at this time.
However, this expert points out that this year will be a little different, because it believes that marathon will come before, in the second week after the long-term week, at the occasion of the Constitution.
This analysis does not assume that vocatility would affect the market concentration.
Federico Olucha, Analytic Inversis Banco, also considers that we are approaching the technical level and that they were able to observe the reflection of the index from the United States' reports on the increasing crisis on the credit market.
The analysis does not mean that these results will be placed.
Analytics agree with the selection of titles that are to take Ibex to the new maximum quotas.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that "the year is a series of powerful titles."
This expert would include both large banks and some building companies in the portfolio, "for when this period comes, the energy industry will be very precious."
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco assures that adults will go in hand with banking and industrial sector.
Building companies will also be able to be rich in this marathon if it comes to it.
"Acs has received a position again for several months and we hope that other building companies, such as Ferrowial and FCC, will go on the same way," explains the expert.
The cyclical requirement will be in the last part of the year before by increased sales during the Sunday sale period.
This expert, on the other hand, will also be very good, even though they are not too represented on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the past seven years, the guard was only in two cases of a month of fall.
The actual marathon passed at the end of the year 2003, in the administration year when the markets had ended the crisis resulting from the disturbance of the bubble.
Years when Ibex 35 returned 28.17%, the chairman increased by 6.68%.
We will see if 2007 will be in the fifth year of profit (and Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether he will have his maraton at the end of the year.
Two hundred bathrooms of the Popular Bank will be opened 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Bank Popular decided to modernize the amount of its runs.
A total of two hundred located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These sides operated under the Popular Max mark are a big change for the bank.
Similarly, for the final Spanish entities, it is the first group that has decided to make such a hopp and put on the continuous opening period of its runs until 20:30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20:30 hours.
BBVA, another group, who has also sometimes assured that he wants to extend the opening period of its runs, has not yet decided to do this step.
Meanwhile, it is decided to conclude an agreement with the Committees on the cancellation of the opening time 75 % of its shares on the Sabbath to exchange for a long-term opening time for one afternoon, even if it is never for the public.
The results of this experience will be that the Popular Bank will decide to join other entities to this initiative supporting the opening period of trade.
That's exactly the goal of the project that was related to the Popular Bank.
Get individual customers who are spent in these places after their purchases, smaller and medium companies, animals and trades from the selected streets, where they are going to open the streets.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these travels throughout Spain for about 18 months, because it is not about the opening of new trailers, but only about the adjustment of existing ones.
From that point, the bank modernizes the areas already in the business areas by adapting them to the profile of customers in individual streets.
This is the extension of the opening time completed with another understanding of the space of the side and the new, more current design in lighter colours.
The Business Director of the Bank Angel River assures that this restructuring means a great investment, but more a staff set, since six employees are able to switch from eight to nine.
The halls will even be equipped for small and medium-feeding meetings and will sell non-financial products.
Move the experience for the group.
The Bank Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrids sides.
And it was to position the experience, as Angel River explains.
It was elected in the Madrid Streets Bravo Murillo, O'Don and Gran Via, and according to River, it seems to be a happy choice.
Bank Popular has currently 2.500 runs.
And other 60 specialists for immigrants who are operated under the Monocredit mark also have a very large opening period and are even opened on Sunday and on holidays.
PopularMax's sides follow the BBVA model when a number of its shops offers to sell a large scale of non-financial products.
"We don't want to fight our clients," says River.
They have just agreed with the Telephone on the sale of mobile mobiles and on the basis of external staff.
Telecinco first on the bourgeois doubled its value of Antena 3 rival
We've done it.
This was the fact that Paolo Vasile, executive President Telecinco, had his pleasure in the conclusion of trade when he found that the television he was conducting doubled its value of Antena 3.
Only one thing caused his joy: 'What hates me is that it has happened because they have grown more, but because we have fallen less down', he declared.
And then he highlighted that thanks to the weak market, 'We're less.'
Telecinco ended the trade yesterday by 2.54% movement.
This profit moved their loss to 15,66 % at the next half of the year.
The value of this company controlled by Mediase (52%) for Vocent (13% further) so, according to Bloomberg's data, is 4 488,88 million euros.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell by 1.52% yesterday and totally decreased by 40.5% since January, has a half value of 2 193.46 million.
The value of the final telecommunication fires, evaluated, is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2.518.53 million Prisa (sealer Cinco Days) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antena 3 offers, because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how we can do this on the same market, for what price and how we will evaluate it in follow-up.
Telecinco announced last week that it has been calculated this year by convinceing a billion billion income from the public will become the first television channel, as Giuseppe Tringali, executive President Telecinco and Publiespaña, which ensuring the group's advertising.
In order to achieve the predicted data, this TV channel would set up the increase in the remarks of 3.6% above 965.4 million in 2006.
In the first nine months of the year, the pure Antena 3 was increased by 1.6% (and reached by 4.4 million), while the pure television income increased by 0.7% (63.4 million).
One of the factors in which the analysis aims, for the best relative development of Telecinco in the bourgeois, is an increased payout which has yet been maintained: in 2006, this company, which is President Alejandro Echevarria, divided between its shareholder 100 % of its profit.
Vasile ensures that, even if it is to decide soon, this coefficient could change after purchasing 33 % of the endmol company and its mother company Mediaset.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have announced much more.
This year I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, which we have already increased the value of 33% endmolu'.
According to the market analyses at these moments, it shows a certain surprise.
Lehman Brothers recently decreased its estimates of the profit of Telecinco, which was 4 % in 2008 and 7 % in 2009.
This caused them to explain that the estimated income growth was stopped from 0.5 % to 8.4 % in 2008 and from 5.5 % in 2009.
The company also decreased the estimated winning of Antena 3, which was 4.5 % in 2008 and 7.5 % in 2009.
3 patterns
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both titles mainly on the basis of a increased dividend and a sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: values better Telecinco (hromadit) than Antena 3 (keeping) due to its "readable preference" and the growth of trade.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends not to appreciate them, because they are headed "like threats" (overlapsed market and deteriorated economic disorders).
Congress approved the transfer of MiFIDu valid from 1 November
In comparison with the parliamentary negotiations that have been completed today by the voting of the Congress on the news of the Senate to the Law, the Government has underlined the public hearing of the regulation that develops the new law, in order to both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of individual parties have also highlighted the efforts to negotiate and agree with the best standard to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulations of the entities necessary for the functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which adjusts the valuable paper trade legislation, provides the modernisation of the financial markets and also strengthens the protection of the investor, improves the oversight powers of the State Commission for the Market of Values (CNMV) and supports cooperation between individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new Regulation allows the service of financial advice as well as specialised companies, both physical and legal persons, and creates a new type of fire of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory company (AFI), which are connected to a company with valuable papers, with a office with valuable papers and a portfolio management company.
Furthermore, the number of financial instrument operational systems is extended in order to join the regulated secondary markets multilateral trade systems and internalisation systems of orders that will comply with the current bourgeois.
The Law further bindings the company providing investment services to spread information on the market on the key aspects of their trade profile, exposure of risks and ways of equity and requires the list of all operations carried out to simplify the supervision by the CNMV.
During the negotiation in the Trade Commission of the Congress, a number of adjustments included the fact that secured considerations were considered a "complicated" financial instrument due to the high risk of investors demonstrated by what happened in the United States with high risk-hypothetic debts (subprime).
The transposition of the Directive was also used for legal applications that could be stopped by bacteria in the economy and the management of the undertaking 30 years after the approval of the King Decree in 1977, which applies to the experts for economy.
Similarly, the Senate has arranged the creation of new professionals in the financial sector, such as the developer who will work externally, and will require the CNMV authorisation and will be able to provide services for trade with products and to obtain customers for different investment companies.
The harmonised ISC increased by five decades to 4,1 % in November
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides a preliminary information on how prices were developed in Spain during November.
Its publication corresponds to the Eurostat and the Central European Bank (ECB) policy to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated as the same process used for the Harmonised Index of consumer prices but for the use of different methods of statistical modeling for the review of information that is not yet available during the publication.

"ISC will continue to be maintained at relatively high level"
The second president of the Government and the Minister of Economics Pedro Solbes stated that the ISC increase by 4.1% is "in time", however, the price index will continue to be relatively "height level" in the next months.
In any case, Solbes in the Congress kiloars stated that "and if this is a positive number", Spain's inflation difference against the monetary union is still the same in the last two years.
He also explained that November was less surprising than the previous month when the government did not count on such a high increase.
"We expected a value of approximately 4%," said the Minister of Economic Affairs to the currently submitted data.
Virgin is planning to win with Northern Rock 42 billion euros for three years
Since the time that Northern Rock received the crisis in the mid-September and had to decline to the bank of England's loan, its contributions were over 50 % to 12 billion euros (16.8 billion euros).
The Bank then managed the recorded contributions of more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually in two and a half months did not trust customers, even though the government offered a gradual guarantee for these money and extended it to the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who replaces the name of the entity with its business financial label Virgin Money, gets around the quarter of the income in the British banks in the next three years, so that it gets those remaining 18 billion pounds and so reaches 30 billion.
A group of magnitude Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom by his ideal advertising campaigns, is planning to lose 50 million liberal (approximately 70 million euros) per year for advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Bank Northern Rock this week marked the proposal for the Virgin consortium, which constitutes other three companies, such as those who give the privilege to save them from the bankrot.
Ancient Totany arrested for data corruption practices at the exhibition
The civil guard today, in early early early hours, has held the current age of the city of Totana (of the People's Party) for its data involvement in corruption practices in the exhibition that were discovered this week.
Thereafter, one of the secretary of the office and the local police head was arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced in May this year, Juan Moralese, the current human rapporteur, and until the age of an alien, which, according to the investigated resources of Cadena SER TV, could be "the head" of the whole company.
Policies continue to follow the buildings of the Council and the Construction Committee and do not exclude further interventions in the next hours.
In addition, the lawyer Juan Moralese, the principal suspicious of corruption practices, was accused of building discovered at the beginning of this week.
As Cadena SER informed yesterday, lawyer of the 'lidoveck' lawyer Juan Moralese, who was checked, arrested at the department of Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, investigated resources include the subject of the investigation of Morales’ data choice for the signature of the building agreement with a powerful building company, which has been reviewed by 200 hectares of lands.
Eight people have been arrested at the moment.
Bono adopted a proposal for state in the head of the Toledo candidate of the PSOE and, if they win, president of the Congress
The former Defence Minister José Bono adopted the proposal for the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of the Socialists José Luis Rodrigue Zapater to stand at the next general elections in the PSOE candidate letter (Spanish Socialist Party) in Toledo, and in the case of socialists win the general elections, he became President of the Congress.
Thus, on the print, the secretary of the PSOE for the organization of José Blanco and Bono, after the meeting with Zapater, who walked south in the Federal Side of the Party today.
The Executive Boss' offer to the former Minister rejected that in the political life "is important to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems," this policy from La Manchy will be a candidate to the President of the Congress, if socialists in the next victory elections.
Bono would, as President of the Congress, replace Manuela Marina, who published its decision on 15 November to disappear in the next general elections and leave its active political career so that it could be able to combat climate changes in the University Education.
The former Minister admitted that the president of the Government insisted on him to return to the top policy that he left two years ago.
He further noted that as the citizens who would be the Minister of Economic Affairs, if PSOE wins elections, his side wanted to announce who would preside the Congress.
Bono gets this, he hopes that the Snavement changes to "the house of respect and never a pleasure or a cry" and is to "will be more like the citizens".
"In some cases, it seems to be the only place in Madrid where it is not in peace and peace to speak is the Congress, the president of the Government in Senate, at one occasion, interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he spoke praising words to the current president Manuel Marina and his "good work" and did not want to imagine himself at his place so that he would not decrease the way he pointed out what his opposers could think of "majority".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate changes is a deterioration of irreversible monitoring as well as those who look skepticly on his speech, as well as those who give priority to other political and social fights, they must demonstrate strong coherence.
Moreover, having a leader of movement that is the president of the government like Zapatero and that this fight is more important than the fight against the Islamic terrorism and even will sign "new with the planet".
This report requires him to explain why his government's activity or inactivity have contributed significantly to the leading of Spain in the European Union in the discompliance of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this incompletion in which sectors it is, and why his government, the government, has not prohibited it.
Moreover, it requires it to explain to Spain what measures it has to take to accelerate climate changes.
The companies that will be harmed by which the habits of the population will need to be changed, which energy support, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
With other words, who sacrifices and who pays for the salvation of the planet.
But we didn't expect such explanations, we didn't even wait.
It's just because it's necessary to sacrifice and pay.
Prevention against climate changes, real measures, are unfair.
Dear, inappropriate and threatening business and private characteristics.
Even one centimeter of the benzine price imposed by the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Working Party), Zapater seemed to be so riskant in the view of the election that he soon refused.
In other words, it is to save the planet so that it doesn't happen, a pure propaganda, the passwords that provide any real importance.
Special phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And with the planet; this lord is so useful for the election campaigns that do not speak, doesn't accuse, doesn't require anything, but it's the beauty of the beauty and excites it.
It is limited to it to be only a contractual party and doesn't wish, and they were running on the road and able to join them.
Officer and leader of the local police of Totana are arrested for suspiciousness of corruption practices at the exhibition
As the research resources were informed, the Civil Garde arrested the oldest city of Totana, the "person" of José Martínez Andreo, the local police boss, the secretary of the council and one host undertaken, for suspecting the destruction of criminal acts at the exhibition.
The senior was arrested in his dwelling and transferred to the council, where there is now together with a number of police officers who have also delivered to the Commission for Equipment and the City Company for Economy with Industry Lands and Lifes.
These three arrests arrived to the sixth last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during the operation associated with transplantation of more than 2 million hectares of agriculture grounds suitable to prevent Nuaria from paying illegal provisions during the past election period, could set up 4 000 homes.
Moreover, two other persons were not arrested, but they were accused of a short procedure at the court of Totan.
The first six arrested were sent to the court today.
According to the information resources, the previous chairman Totany and today the member of the Autonomous Parliament for the Lithuania (PP), Juan Morales is investigated.
Next, his former wife, the owner of the reality office, registered today in Totana, as well as his present friend who lives in Murcia, the main city of autonomy.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and a businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (Province Pontevedra), as well as Paul José M. G., director of the company Suelo de Inmonuar, who belongs to that group and has not been charged.
The investigation is conducted by a group of criminal acts in the building of a civilian central unit, whose members have also conducted eleven views, most of the companies associated with arrested companies, with the seat in Madrid, Vigu, Murcii, Pontevestre, Las Rosas (Province Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, and it was in a very famous company owner of products of a milk meat that could serve as a producer.
The Nuaria group was charged with the building of the largest residential complex of the city of Totana, which would represent the building of more than 5 000 houses, golf boxes and two hotels with "slape".
The company obtained 2,2 million quarter meters of land, which had been overseen, and its project had to double the residence of an alien with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group constitutes companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which support the market with immobility, Conycase, which is a parking in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and in the location of Fernando el Catholico in Vigo, Hogartel, which is focused on direct marketing and Preconiza, which is focused on promotion, sale and montage of building elements.
And that's happening.

Our Finnish writer sends us this comment from the most important issue of the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat in yesterday (although at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the news printed on November 18th, on the day where the circumstances occurred in the Blackburn book's criticism:
"The contents of the philosophy came into public debates about the tragedy at school in Jokel.
The time of the victims, the student of the high school, in his messages of Platon and Nietzsche's work.
Pekka Elo, a filosof adviser responsible for education, requested on the pages of Helsingin Sanomat's journal that Professors might find a critical position to Platon and claimed that it was not necessary to examine Netzsche in a vital basic course of philosophy at the high schools."

A colleague shall inform about the introduction of a criminal download from the Internet to the criminal law:
A. Placement of one song would be a criminal act from six months to one year.
In contrast, when you cut the table in the price less than 400 euros in the market, it is considered to be just a transition (§ 623.1).
B. If you cut up to 1 000 euros in the trade, it is already a criminal action, but the penalty rate is less than for download (§ 234 of the penalty law).
C. You'll steal the car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (§ 244.1).
D. It's less serious to get a wheel than a compass change.
Participation of the extent has a rate from three months to one year (§ 154 of the criminal law) and by exchange of compacts, the rate would be from six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Court of Justice).
E. Sexual employment burden is considered as less serious than the DVD download of the film.
F. The non-distributed distribution of films protected by copyright is punished before providing pornographic materials to youths (§ 186).
So if my colleague doesn't worry, he's throwing his hand to someone, right.

My doctor's awareness that one of his articles about wonderful research called "Pines cause the brain to be activated, especially if the finals get less."
Or the feelings that cause monthly payment to employees depend on how many colleagues it makes.
The research was conducted at the Bonn University using magnetic resistance to the tomograph and the results are published in the last number of Science magazine.
According to Bernda Weber, the author of the study and the leader group of Life &Brain's neurogonism in Germany: "To the largest activation was affected when the researcher responded correctly and his colleague wrongly."
The researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same payment, the activation was mild, but when one received a double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion had to require so many times.
Balkan's claims
Carla del Ponte has spent eight years of disgrace from the State Procurement of the Court of Justice in Haag, a crime from the Balkan War.
Her mandate will extinguish at the end of the year and Carla will deal with mixed feelings, because the main victory of massacre in Srebranica, where 8000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former leader of the Bosnian Serbs, are still in freedom.
Their names are on the list from which the name of the documentary film of the Swiss Registry Marcela Schüpbach "Karlin list" (2006, unspecified in Spain), which follows a detective thriller from Belgrade after New York by the work of the Swiss resort to the investigation of flight criminals and the pressure on the relevant states to join the network.
What assurance is appropriate for me?
Insurance of a car protected by the driver in the case of a accident. represents a significant expenditure depending on different factors such as the state, the sex, the length of the driver's control, the type of vehicle to be cut or the use of it.
It's just the beginning to have a car.
Choose adequate vehicle insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
In the first row, we need to explain what we're talking about.
The vehicle insurance is an agreement between the insurance and the insurance.
This commitment takes into account the form of insurance, which states that the insurance will obtain a agreed fixed amount at a certain height because it will take care of payment of damage in the case of an emergency event.
The price of the insurance, which shall be determined in the light of different factors such as the state, the sex, the length of the drive demonstration, the type of vehicle that is insured or used by the vehicle.
The insurance company sets their prices on the basis of it, so the more likely it is to come to the hair, the higher is the higher rates.
From this point, as well as the 25-year-old and women, they must pay less costly, because they show that they have less risk index as regards their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of controls, the insurance company concluded that those who live in marriage are less fair than free drivers.
The method used by the vehicle will affect the frequency of the driving and thus the probability that it will have an accident.
Increasing charity of driving, the probability is increased.
There are many variables that make sure that they consider when determining the price of the insurance.
Therefore, the driver must simplify the simplification to choose such insurance that best corresponds to his insurance profile.
We will show the most important variables here for the choice of the type of assurance, which will also be at a reasonable price, except that it is a type of insurance.
People younger than fifty years are faced with different accidents such as a little experience with management and a short drive of driver evidence when they want to settle accurately on the available price.
Although ideal for good covering is insurance against all risks, there are also more low variants.
Impatrable drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a low-supported in order to obtain accurate covering all risks, but at a more acceptable price.
This species would assume that the client should participate in the replacement of the event.
"The part of the refund of the accommodation of the customer's advance will be determined by determining the price of the deficiency, which will be higher than the lower part of the partnership," explains Luis Noguera, the main leadership company of First Europe in Spain, the assurance provider on the Internet.
Other options are the assurance extended to the other operators of the operation so that the client will be concerned against damage caused by other persons, but not against damage in his own car.
In addition, he would be assured against stealing, fire, and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendation.
You'd be the younger twenty-five years old, try to be careful and avoid the hawairs as possible, because it's your bonus and allows you to reduce the potential in the future.
Bonus is the reduction of the basic rate which the insurance company has.
In contrast, Malus is the increase of the basic rates mentioned.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the security and her profit.
If she had a good year insurance, she will be able to increase the bonus," explains Noguera.
After over the limit of twenty-five years, drivers have easier when they are going to settle insurance, because the customer's risk index decreases them, thanks to the purchased experience.
The most of this is recommended to make survey against all risks to be lost.
"Young people are usually unable to use experiences obtained before the time when it comes to the havary and even in the management," assures the director of the European Society in Spain and adds to the number of havary occurs in the second year of management, when the "fear of newsmen" has already been convinced.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is better to make sure of all risks if it allows its economic ability.
Families with children are considered as a client with a lowest risk index and thus their samples will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be the insurance against all risks with a low-beef (which could make 300 euros) or with a high bonus, the insurance extended to the other operators of the operation begins a third year from the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is more calm and their competitiveness is higher, so they can allow overcome to get the highest left," Luis Noguera subscribes.
Insurance against all risks is recommended to the investigators with a lift of 150 EUR or an insurance extended to the final operators of the operation if a high bonus has been achieved.
It is necessary to say that car assurance is not only important because the protection of the drivers in the case of a hawair, but also because it represents a significant expenditure, which is a result of the appropriate simplification of the possibilities of assurance, which would most of us be expressed in view of our personality.
Celtic is trying to get to the Millan point, which means osmifinal
Mylán and Celtic will wipe their strength on Tuesday at San Siro stadium in trying to get a point that they miss to achieve their relevant objectives at the end of the "Champions" ligue, because it would mean to be the first and to Scotland it would decide on the location.
The Italians have ten points and have already checked the procedure in the fifth stage of reduction in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but another is to make sure that Shachzhor will not get six points that will play with Benfica, who has four.
These two stocks of group D will be played a week before the sixth round ends, since Milan must play in the Intercontinental Coast in Japan, where he first puts the thirteenth in the semifinal, in order to go to the final that is playing at the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before the final and undecisive outcome of Giuseppe Meazzy's stadium seems to be the most likely, even though both men try to get out of victory because the Italians want to tactify on the home ground and Celtic knows that after the heat he would be the first and would make a better place in the 8-final.
Gordon Strachana's husband could even make a loss, if Shachzhor doesn't win, but it can't be done, because at the same number of nine points Ukrainians who lost Glasgow (2:1) last week, but won in the first direct delay (2:0).
And thus the players Milán will try to stop the night to Scotland who feel that the basic will get into the semifinal in the reorganized Champions League just as they hit them in the same delay in the past competition with Kaka in prolongation (1:0) after status 0:0 in the basic game time.
Hope that they win "rossoneri" will be the Shahroer, whose price is victory only if Celtic lost, both for the process to the occifinal and for the EUFA.
Benfica, although it is the latter and it is not a chance to continue in the highest European competition, it could achieve a third place by one victory, so it would play in EUFA.
The first concert in the tournee Spice Girls attended 20 000 people in Vancouver
The Group of Spice Girls started in Vancouver (Canada) before 20,000 birds of her first tour since she fell in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sports Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) soon before they started their concert at the GM Place station in Vancouver, they declared that the reconnection of their group is "good".
Approximately 20,000 people have bought income to be a present concert, which also included videos that include the stories of this group, which had caused the feeling at the end of the nineteen years.
Return and world tour will be played at the same time when the new album is issued in Spain, which provides the selection of their main successful tracks, as well as two new songs, Headlines and Vodoo.
The Five Spice Girls appeared on the wheel of the splendid arms that the husband gave them "Posh Spice", the British Guard David Beckham.
This sportsman was in a public that broadcasted GM Place, although Victoria's nervous appeals to him a few days ago.
Before the beginning of the presentation of Victoria Beckham stated the British star that "he didn't see our bones at all, so I'm nervous about what he's thinking about imagination."
The "Sports Spice", whose department from the group in 1998 "for two years of distortions between us" caused the release of the five-number group, also showed its nervousness in meeting journalists two hours before the beginning of the presentation.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw the world public opinion changed, the opinion of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, so I thought I had decided," Chisholm said about the reconnecting of the group that she solved herself nine years ago.
The song also noted that in the time process, "the worlds have been equaled and we all have too much."
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls came together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to the CTV TV, the group flew to Vancouver, the Virgin Airlines specialist.
At the airport, the army was expected to be a tree.
Five has seven kids at all.
After a concert in Vancouver, a group will be held in California (USA), San José (4 ́nce) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 ́nce).
In Madrid, the 23th is going out.
Anxieties of new gas coverage between Russia and Ukraine
between Russia and Ukraine, there is just a lot of land gas prices and thus increases the risk that Russian fuel supply can be affected in the West Europe.
The majority of Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is conducted through Ukraine and any conflict between these two countries is focused on.
Kyiv warned that if Moscow lifts up the price of gas to Ukraine, Russia will make higher transit taxes.
The previous conflict between these two last year decreased the supply to the EU States.
The latest dispute between Kyiv and Moscow comes on the moment when the Ukrainian government and the Russian own gas monopol, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says that Ukraine will have to increase, because he agreed to pay up up to 50% more for gas from the neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysers say that this might mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supply from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transaction states during the negotiation," said the Ukrainian Ministry of Anatolia China's Economy.
"The changes in gas prices should, of course, be linked to our arguments relating to the higher transit payments (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The final dispute between Moscow and Kyiv caused the reduction of the supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a mild fall of exports to Western Europe, which increased prices.
The Russian gas represents one quarter of supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas resources in the world, but most of them remain inadequate.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Mediterranean Republics.
NHS " must control employees"
The controller said that Scotland com_ NHS must improve the control of criminal records in non-European staff.
The recommendation from the President of the Higher Control Authority of Robert Black has occurred after the interventional doctor in Scotland was linked to the red attacks on the Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black is also afraid that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the quantity of the employee employee.
But his report emphasized that the final key controls were in line with the sample of five health offices.
The President of the Supreme Control Authority was concerned without prejudice after June attacks on the Glasgow Airport on the staff obtained from the country outside the European Economic Area.
Eighth-twenty-year-old Bilal Abdullah, a Iraqian doctor in Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the aircraft after someone brought Jeep into the door of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court by means of the videomount accused of connecting to bomb attacks in Britain.
From NHS, it is expected to verify the employee's staff in the context of the work, experience and authorisation in the United Kingdom before his employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland to control criminal records, this Agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the United Kingdom.
The rapporte to the Highest Control Authority states, other than recommendations that the Commission should be allowed to be conducted by the Criminal Records Bureau Directives which help employees with controls in several countries.
"Although we have found that part of staff records contained evidence of these controls, they are not regularly carried out," reported the report.
Mr. Black said that the Scotch NHS agrees in many ways with its own pre-employment policies, but added also: "Our report warns about the systems that could be improved in order to ensure the availability of accurate information on the quantity of staff."
President BMA Scotch Dr. Peter Terry said that it is "very unlikely" that pre-employment controls would identify potential NHS employees that could be in the future for a terrorist action.
"The report points out that current pre-employment controls in Scotland NHS work well and that there is no more value that these will bring on," he said.
The Scotland Health Authorities reported that it currently has 1 161 employees, of whom the majority are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the Higher Control Authority noted that these numbers would also be higher because the Commission had to identifie the staff authorised to reside.
The investigation also discovered that the control procedures carried out in NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glassgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were performed in large manner.
They included the controls of passports, work authorisations and employment.
The Swedish Government currently re-works the policy and the Pre-employed Control Directives for NHS occupational work.
The Minister for Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I wanted to do this work without a terrorist attack on the Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scotch Government, in accordance with the Health Commissions, considers the recommendations of this report and ensures that the best procedures appear in the updated pre-employment controls of all staff, including the staff, which is planning to issue the next month.

Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for terrorism
Yesterday, Saudi Arabia announced that she arrested 208 soldiers for membership in cells preparing without a attack on farming equipment, as well as on spirit and security components.
The State TV of the largest rope exporter reported that one of the cells wanted to put the rackets into the country.
Simpatizants al-Kaida have led a campaign against monarchia, the United States associations, since 2003, since the invasion to Iraq.
The television report reported that the eight military cell led by the foreigner planned an attack on landing equipment in the Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia sets up an entity of 35,000 members to defense the equipment from an incapacity attack of al-Qaida to the largest world industry for the processing of the rock in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report was sensing the internal declaration of the Ministry: 18 prisoners belonged to the cell conducted by the "expert for cracking rackets" that broke into the country.
She further noted that military men planned to go into the kingdom eight shots.
22 arrested were to prepare murders of spiritual and security works.
The government invited the spirit to prevent Saudi to go to Iraq in order to join the Al-Kaida militaries fighting the United Armies and the Swiss Government supported by the United States, which Sunnite Saudi consider Katch.
Al-Kaida soldiers believe that the authorities bought many spirits in Saudi Arabia to support the king's family governing the government.
Militants - supported the challenges of the leader of Al-Kaidy Saud Usamy bin Ladina to focus on the West Soviet Government - were focused on alien resident complexs, government buildings and energy equipment.
"This war was a great effort for security forces in the past... five months," said the State TV of the Internal Challenge Ministership.
It was also arrested a 16-medium "medial cell" in Media, which was aimed at promoting "takfirian thoughts" - the ideaology of the Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against the Muslims marked as unbelievers and disfellowshipped.
32 people were also charged with financial support to military soldiers.
Climate on Venusa is possible to view the future of the Earth
Scientists told yesterday that Venus could ever be a pleasant place for life.
Data from the European station show that the planet is even more similar to its main duplicate of the Earth than it was thought earlier.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same large and running after similar dears, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now say that a billion years ago, the Venus was like those on Earth and could also be resident.
But the deteriorated glass effect caused by carbon oxide, atmosphere erosion of solar radiation and lower rotation was sent to Venus in a completely different way of development.
Today the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is quite heavy enough for the taving of the storm and the force of the urican.
Findings from the sonds of the European Space Agency Venus Express, who studied the planet one year, offers a coherent view of how the Earth could develop in the case of disasterous climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Oxford University's Physics Category and one of the leaders of the mission Venus Express said: "It's more clear why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, although the planets themselves are differently similar.
"Our new data enables us to set a scenario in which Venus started as the Earth, perhaps with a population, a billion years ago."
The police kept the "reached uran"
A kilo of radioactive material, evidently rich urane, was arrested by the Slovenian and Hungarian police yesterday.
The police speaker said three people were arrested and the material was investigated.
He did not confirm that it was a rich uranium, but he said that the substance could be sold for a million dollars (480 000 pounds).
Continued upgraded
Mitt Romney said that for the president's candidates it is not appropriate to answer the questions from the snowman.
Yet, the Republican presidents agreed with the debate at YouTube, where the ordinary electors replaced their questions on video and delivered them to the candidates sent.
No of the questions sent in the middle 28 November was as comic as a snowman who asked democrates for global heating in the debate on YouTube on the other side.
But the questions and answers this time have reflected many on the status of the Republican Party to the elections in the next year.
It is not fair, as CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, have chosen the clips that were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half of the debate, the longest time for the only subject, was focused on the mobility.
This topic is one of the most powerful topics of the Republic.
CNN requested the panel of undetermined electors to turn back to the cow when they heard something comforting: the voter mentioned the summary of approval when the candidates talked about strong access to the audiences.
The strongest and longest exchange of views has occurred between Rudy Giulianim, the main national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who has spread forward in the key fast votes in Job and New Hampshir.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to raise the story of a man who was as the primator of New York, a mild for illegal mover.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former massachusetts state's former immigrants for his work at home.
These two were particularly responsible when the tazzators asked whether some of the candidates would support "amnesty" (date to illegal immigrants normal position and citizenship opportunity).
Further candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, Californian Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, congressman from Colorada, have been able to reach their little in a moon on this subject.
No one of these two has a chance of nomination, but both remain in the game maybe that they started to fight for immigration before and stronger than the final.
At least the candidates have the same opinion on the mobility: more pressure on employment, no tolerance for illegal persons.
This subject, together with anxiety of food games from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps the republicans to forget or minimise the dispute between freedom and Christian conservators.
But the debate began to be very unfair when it came to other subjects.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported the shooting weapons in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the technology of simulated heating should be considered torture.
One questioner asked whether candidates would have every word of the Bible.
Through this, Mr. Giuliani concluded that, even though the Bible is his favorite book, he would not believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another taughter asked whether Jesus would support death.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all the prejudices in the first place in the recent investigation in Job thanks to his Christian conservation - said that death punishment is inappropriate but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too wise to candidate to what he used to do.
The master remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee's growth in Iowa is covered with recent success in receiving money and the voice of Ron Paul's voice in the central debate.
These two have turned away from the bottom because both sides are still unable to agree on known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very quickly and convincedly with the victory report of the American Size on the lips, living on both side wings.
This time, the side is divided and the output is far away.
Labourist diseases
Gordon Brown found again the sand to fall into; his way out is the same.
Although it's in the British political scandals, this is not particularly piant.
It doesn't seem to be sold by such rules, no mystery payment in the Paris hotel, no extra-married fingerprints were charged.
But the Bariced Gordon Brown would be surrounded without to be found that a rich undertaking has masked the contributions of the Governing Laboratory Party at 650 000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) under the names of other people, and that the party has not announced.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister rejected the vote calling and disappointed the British intellectual by claiming that this decision had not been affected by the investigation, it had been able to ensure that the government would be disappointed and effective.
Instead of formulating this by the more amazing representative of the Liberal Democrats, Mr. Brown's feared one time changed from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The unsecure salvation of the Northern Rock Bank has shown weaknesses in the management and the challenging trial under the fire.
Bad thoughts on the change of tax law connected companies against government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has discovered an unrepresentable administration of pride.
Three generals in the income deployed the rebellion in the snowless Lords; protested against armed expenditures, because they claimed to be the captain of armed forces is the work of a partial account.
Now there are many gifts from David Abraham; Peter Watt, the general secretary of the publicists (and their former internal guardian), has already rejected.
It doesn't mean that Mr. Brown would not turn back to his end.
However, governments can reach the point of interruption which they are looking for tough governance.
People don't believe politicians and don't have them, but sometimes they'll take their uncertainty when we're taking a new party.
When it seems that a Prime Minister probably doesn't improve anything and doesn't have to be in the office, this is the decline: the State administration becomes a treasure, the ministers are coming to make a lettering, the print is looking for bad news and the government becomes unconcentred and defense.
In one direction, Mr Browna's position is particularly difficult, because other political leaders can not take the position of a new cost.
Whatever he would have been away from Tony Blair, he was his first teacher.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the records of the financial authority are linked to the decisions made by Mr Brown as the Minister for Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in blairy malarias, such as long investigation of the financing of political parties caused by "values for money", electors can calmly explode that he was.
However, Mr. Brown's hatred is not as bad as they look.
The surfaces are not so terrible as the conservators are doing.
With regard to Mr. Bean, no one died or was exposed to an accusation.
And the treatment, as far as it can be painful, is to ensure what the stalinistic trends of Mr Browna promised: a comfortable, firm and easily brutal government.
The newest distortion around political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboide Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he did not want any publicity for his goodness.
That could be true, but the decision wasn't on him.
The laws against anonymously large political gifts are excluded and exist from a simple gift: the public has the right to buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he felt about the procedure of Mr. Abraham, but he didn't know that he was illegal, he would certainly be heard fairly; too, Jon Mendlesohn, the main guardian of money, who had learned about obscene gifts in October.
But yet Mr. Brown is not any complex; there is nothing that would indicate that he was thinking of these flocks, although the main part of payment was running after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the job yet.
He condemned this violation of laws by his own side, but he determined his determination by seating the certificate instrument, the Commission for the investigation of this matter - also leading by a bishop in the income and the judge.
In this case, learning is not difficult.
If the law has been violated, it's the case of the police.
Furthermore, there are other things Mr Brown must do, for example, to find an independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has no one for six months, and to deal with the reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require those who are in difficulty to cooperate with the conservators and may also give up their special financial relationship with the committees - bitter pills for the dedicated party, Mr Brown.
But he should take some of the simple facts.
Conservatives now have a suitable step in the investigation; he has two years to get from the electoral engine; and the only way to gain victory is an inappropriate integrity and higher power.
Card cartridges
Does the American credit card market affect the crisis of subsequent hypothics?
When the blood is in the water, it is natural that it will be excited to have a gross floor.
Now when the American market with insolvencies is broken, the translators have focused on the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs' analyses say that losses on credit cards, if the subordinated hypothecase had been decreased by other credit variants, could be achieved 99 billion dollars.
The pressures are clear.
Increases the number of cases of incapacity of payment (for more than 30 days late) and descripted (conts that the supplier considers unemployable).
The Bank HSBC announced last month that on the US market, it lost 1,4 billion dollars - too because of the credit card loans.
However, it's still soon on panic.
The descripted and incapacity of paying is still little.
According to Moody's evaluation agency, the payment incapacity rate was 3.89% in the third quarter of the total percentage point under the average.
The deteriorating conditions are partly explained by the technical dishes.
Amendment in the American Banking Acts of 2005 led to a decrease in the number of reported bankrots that make a large amount of losses on credit cards; therefore, the reporting amount (and the amount of repayments) would be deteriorated, notwithstanding whether the general submissions for the loans were deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good debt, which indicates the amount of debt payments each month from their debts.
And confidence in the valuable papers of guaranteed credit cards is strong, even through the paralysis in other angles of structured financialness.
Mr. Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup research company provides that their volumes for 2007 will be more than 25% than the floor.
The direct paths for enlargement of infections between subsequent hypothecs and the credit card market are definitely available: when the loans are dry in immobility, the debtors are more debt over the credit cards.
However, credit card issuers are more interested than the values of the main objects, so the falling prices at home do not need to mean a change in the confidentiality of the loans.
They may even be eligible for the loans providers.
The motivation of the beneficiaries to pay the hypoteques is reduced when the value of their owner is decreased under the value of the loan; therefore the debt on cards is moved up on the list priority for payment.
Emitteners also can react more flexiblely and more flexiblely to the windspeeds than the hypothec providers by changing rate rates or debt limits.
This should be theoretically reduce the risk of changes in the price of the main objects.
"It's not going to happen that ≥ one beautiful man just that all the loans were overestimated," says Gary Perlin, the financial leader of Capital One.
Although the risk of explosion in subordinate hypotheca is low, the risk of progressive weakness is far more real.
The lower price of household and debt debt is pressing America into recess, the credit card industry will stand before the darker future.
Take care of the fucking floor.
British bankers have admitted a wine in the case of Enron
Three British bankiers who had to be judged for their role in the subjugation associated with the former financial leadership of Enron Andrew Fastowe have changed the statement in the middle of the middle and admitted the guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew have been guilty of seven accusations from the subduction when they had to participate in the financial underground in 2000 with Fastway -- to be rich for their employees -- they had a contribution.
They had to stand before the court in January.
However, during the judgment before the American Periodical Judge Ewing Wolley Jr., each of them was acknowledged to one dumb.
The case of these three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, figured on the front pages for two years that continued the release management.
In the United States, their case is one of the non-closed parts of the investigation started after Enron's road in 2001.
The accusation against them in 2002 warned Mr. Fastow that it was a goal of government investigation on Enron's border.
The accusation against bankers -- who served the "NatWest Trinity" overseer -- claims that in 2000 they came to Houston to deal with Fast and his former major coach Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partnership site controlled by Fastwee, which was the text of a lot of enronetic undergrounds that enroned after the spiral direction of the bankrot.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share in this hall of zero, but our three British have made it a significant value.
The company under Kopper's control bought a share of the bank in this hotel for $1 million.
Incrimination bankiers paid Kopper for a share of $ 250,000 in this company.
According to the complaint of Fastow, Enron claimed that the energy company would pay for its share in this company by Greenwich NatWest 20 million dollars.
Of course, 20 million of them were in the absence to the British bankiers, Fastov and other.
Bankers received 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper, and others improved about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted the wine in two cases for his role in Enron.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently in the six-year-old penalty in the Federal Union in Louisiana.
Kopper is in the trial of three years and one month in the equipment in Texarkana.
All three British people moved to the freedom of 1 billion dollars to stay in the United States for the Court of Justice.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, entered into the bankrot in 2001 after the years of the ethnic tricks was not able to hide billion debts or to show deficient speculations as winners.
The deterioration has cancelled thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and the former leader Jeffrey Skilling were condemned last year for their roles in the fall of the company.
Skilling is in the execution of over 14 years of punishment.
The sentences of Lay for injury, injury and other accusations were deleted after he died for heart disease last year.
Moscow Insufficiency
The price of the airport Gulfstream G550, equipped by Rolls-Royce engine, and with sufficient fuel volume for non-stop fly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is little to return.
"He can take up to 18 travelers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one of them's interested in so many places because it's for a strong family or a fire president."
Mr. Firer was sitting in Gulfstream's tent last Friday on the Millionary Exhibition, which is the four-day orgy of the consomm shown in the Mama's exhibition center on the periferia of the main city.
Besides Gulfstream, his tents have set over 200 other luxury suppliers who hoped that the rich Russians would purely attach to everything from the mahagon-laid jachet after the diamants obtained over the cars for which they would not be disappointed nor 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer watched carefully for the orangen Porsche in the nearest town.
"It's a nice car, but it's fifths and decades against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the other largest market for private aircraft."
On the waves of the rock, they're throwing money into the Russian main city as if he had his days in Dallas.
"We have passed the same stage in the 80s when some Americans were very rich and moved to Europe, where they looked as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, listening to the fourth year's in Davis' Centre of Russian and Euro-Asia studies in Harvard.
Like the Saudi distractors of the 70s and Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are the most prominent world losers.
The most exclusive luxury marks are looking for their part on this Klondike.
In another place in Moscow, the Luxurious Industries of Donator Versace, Toma Ford and Bernard Arnault, the President of the LVMH group to exchange ideas of how to sell dear goods on the markets, such as the Russian.
(Conferences organize the International Herald Tribune, whose own company The New York Times Company.)
Russia has a list of the richest people in Forbes 53 billion magazine with a total name of $282 billion.
Furthermore, the local main institution in the Centre for Economic and Financial Research reported on the development of personal riches in former Soviet Swazi, according to which there are 103.000 "super" millions in Russia whose ownership is 670 billion dollars.
(The World Bank states that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived under a minimum of existing minimum in 2005.)
"In Moscow there are hundreds of millions -- and that's why we're all here," Nicole Marais said, the sales and marketing representative of London's curtain David Morris.
She was on the field first, together with the Russian distributor of this label, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are unusually adjusted, and men are everyone for the whole time."
When they passed in dinner chats on Sunday evening, Evgenia Yumatovva, and about five years older Swetlan Turovcov himself and their clients, marked as a million.
"I was looking at that car and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatovva, who got into a brand clothing as a veteran of red coppers, near which Joan Rivers looks like a home road.
Welletrh seemed to be focused mainly on fresh riches, markedly managed Russian buyers who are willing to sit a few hours in the street to be able to walk after the storage that mixed Cadillacy Escalade, platin fisheries, frozen Mövenpick, cotton tables in peace, apartments in Dubai, Gunds, and soil.
The members of the simple public could buy income for EUR 30 ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in what the label is the best and best," said Mr. Gijarath, who patrioticly occupied the stand of the Portuguese Portelan Royal Delft producer before reproducing the image from handly painted blue caillo in a survival size.
"Of course, it's interesting Russian more loan."
And, in fact, the sellers now say that the Russians with old money (based on Russian measurements is 10 to 15 years old) have moved from black logs to a few known marks of limited editions that would never be shown on the purchasing field.
Even so, a few thousand people, whether millionaries, missionaries of millionaries, or simple tourists, each day they flourished the coasts.
And some of them bought.
On the day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil's bed, sold two married gardens of herbai, cashmire and bathrooms, stripped with golden nits, after $70,000.
Similarly, the first day Mikhail Lyubimov, the sales manager of the A1 Moto, who manufactures high-end cars with high-end alarms, said that his company sold the orans porsche for $170,000 to the Russian millionary.
On Wednesday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, President of the company L.A. Connection, who wants to adjust the luxury cars to sell three networks to the car in a interval of connected rows for Rolls-Royce Phantomy after $55,000.
He showed the reporter the car round designed for the Russian owner of the casino, which had an output of the Swarov Crystal so that it looked like a rulet.
Price: $22,000 for four.
"The Russian millionar, who wants a road of a pitch of a cow or a portrait of his wife from a white-shirt, doesn't need to drive on those rounds," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll put them in his garage about 30 to 40 cars."
Although many Russian people are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionary" presently does not mean anything too exclusive, as regards a great increase in prices of current inviolence.
"If you bought yourself three or four years ago in Moscow's apartment, you're probably already millionaries, at least on the paper when you're not ready anymore," he said.
"There's more than you think."
Those who were not millionaries could at least preserve riches at the station of the Russian company operated by Alliance Continental, who cares for active management.
The company produced four red phone buildings of the British phone columns of false banks for a million dollars.
After Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said that his team printed for Veletrh Millionary 500 000 false banks.
Round students stopped to break around the hook of money, or to leave friends to photograph with a mobile phone, how to relax with the replacement of riches, or simply cut a few million caps.
"You know, everyone in Moscow can feel as a millionary," said Mr. Karryev.
Ârt in New Jersey may be caused by a disastrous operation
It was a day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of this restaurant About something healthier and watched the health that came to the white new Ethiopian house of two houses below West Scott Avenue.
The car was connected to the police guard soon.
And then next.
"So I saw the delivery of a court doctor," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant controller.
"In that moment I missed someone died."
The offices learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroy, 41 years old, an executive assistant of the director of the New York Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a non-aliased plastic surgery procedure, whose identity of the police refused to deny that worked in the house number 212 at West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet discovered what caused Mrs. Arroy's death, and they hope that the toxicological tests which have not yet to be known are helping to resolve the mysterious death that the newer police sent a wall of disturbance.
After Arroy was the assistant of the police manager, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many for the division.
"It was loyal, rejoicing and hardly working," Mr. McCarthy said about Miss Arroy at the telephone interview in the middle.
"He was my shield.
She would protect me."
Mr. McCarthy noted that Mrs. Arroy was a wife of Jimmy Arroyo, an ex-new policeman who works for the Commission for the control of alcoholic drinks, and that she left two sons behind herself at the age of 14 and 11 and a non-propried daughter.
Eileen Walsh, the speaker of the state representative of the Union period, Theo′ J. Romankowa, said that the detectives are trying to check whether Arroy died for the consequences of unlimited surgery operation.
"It's one of the possibilities," she said after Walsh.
"The research is still running."
The Offices reported that they reached home about three hours afternoon 21.
November and found Mrs. Arroy on the coach.
She was announced at the place after the dead.
More than a week later, the offices have still said little about their investigation or owner of the house, which seems to be Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh didn't say if the offices heard Mrs. Castro.
The investigators are trying to determine whether the part of the house was used as an appeal.
In the middle of Mrs. Castrové's house, with a devastated round carrier in the pregard and Dalmatin, no one answered
Near the door that led to the store, he trooped in the opened garage the blue bar with the title "Ethyl Vanillin" - which is used as a refund of the vanil in eating and cosmetics.
On the one side, two horses wheels rose up on the one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he first arrived in the New York Police Department for 25 years in New York, Mr. Arroy gave him an invaluable help in testing the unfair and cruel political culture of his new city.
"He said, 'To this or this you should take care," he said.
"He was here when I came, and she was here when I left.
It was crazy."
On the fact that Fed reduces the rates, leads to the strengthening of the world's burst
The prices of action on both the Atlantic sides yesterday, following the market that the Federal Bank will try to relax the loan submissions by further decreasing the rates, have been increased by the relaxing annuals in front of the American Central Bank.
The birds hopped in London, New York and outside Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in order after Ben Bernanke, President Fed, said that, in response to continuing pressure on financial markets, they must be the leading factors of "flexible and pragmatic".
In the light of the effort to calm up the markets in the case of signs of the reliable credit charges, Mr Kohn said that the recent disappointments "partially returned some improvements in the functioning of the markets to the end of September and in October".
He further noted that if the increased instability endures, it will increase the possibility that financial interactions to households and fires continue to be worse.
The investors consider these announcements as a sign that Fed is ready to add further fresh doses to the American markets, and may also further reduction in rates to stabilize credit submissions.
These notes also helped to relax Wall Street with other bad reports on the American economy when the sale of apartments in October showed recordly low numbers.
The funding results were supported by the Bear Stearns Investment Bank's notice that it would distort 650 workshops, which are 4% of its world work and strength, in order to reduce costs for compensation of difficult losses caused by no charge for the provision of subsequent loans for residence in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be canceled in London, where the bank employs 1.500 people.
In New York, the industrial index Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55%, and closed to 13 289,40, while the more used index S&P 500 increased by 2.65%.
The London Index FTSE 100 increased by 165,5 point, or 2,7 per cent, and concluded to 6 306,2 and the value of the British blue-chips increased by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German index Dax increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3%.
Earlier, the credit pressure on the markets has shown full strength after the European Central Bank's three-month money packages have been empowered to the European commercial banks at the rate of 4.7%, which is most than April 2001.
The pressure on the bank to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release over-standard money on the London money markets increased by the rate of the three-month British interbank loans "Libor" after uninterrupted growth from 12 November to its maximum from the end of September - 6,59 per cent.
England must decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilematoes here, one almost the same hard as the other.
Who's going to be number six on the ball for England this weekend in Candy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a wide context of nothing less relevant than the first test against Mrs Lance, who should make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the election committee, which is at the best place at the expensed time, has Peter Moores, the main trainer, and Michael V’han, with a decision to help, and because Hugh Morrise, the main Manager of the English team, begins to comply with the post of a national election, not necessarily.
The one who is set on the sixth place on the coat will be insatisfactory, but life often is not fair and sport no longer.
It is not easy to find what one gets on the top of his profession, while someone else never gets over the lower level, sometimes because of the lack of happiness more than the ability.
Not only in the cricket is the choice adequate and requires a review which finally must be actors.
Is it time to move Bopara up?
It's fair to Shah, if so?
The same could be asked in other ways, let's say that here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both young leaders with good education and a review in the campaign, should be increased in the Commission - the place is only for one.
Who's going to say what level is right for the crickets if he doesn't get a chance to slip or slip on the other one?
Naturally, the numbers have a great influence on decisions, but the same has opportunities.
In the team, the cricket has to take a look at whether to take a wicket, and the copper has a regular chance in the starting positions, if he has ever to make an impression as a single-day cricket.
Taking the selection view is more complicated.
For example, in lonely, there were many better than James Anderson, whose place in the first test seems to be certain, even if Stephen Harmison was declared healthy and overcome as a developer.
Anderson took 32 wickets in the first class at 33 crossings to each.
Chris Tremlett took the same depth only 29, but they both had their moments at the highest level and hoped in the next.
If he's playing at the stadium of Asgiriya Shah, or Bopara can be just a thing of view.
The choice may divorce or reach both career, or does not have a great effect.
Four years ago, on Mr. Lance, Gareth Batty played in each test and in the first class gave good performances, five weeks and 40 permissions, but Paul Collingwood, who was at the same time fighting for his place, who finally became a stabil test cricket, which is more, although in Australia he mentioned two times hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is probably more likely that Graveney, Vrêhan and Moores, after another debate on the current trend just at the stadium of Asirgia, will follow their conservation of instincts and give Shah more experience before Bopar's youth.
There are arguments for both.
For Shaha, he speaks his safe and valuable debut test changes to 88 points in Bombai and 32 hundred in the first class of six Bopars, which is seven years older and has an excellent contrast to the spins.
However, Shah did in two changes in May against Caribbean in the Test on Lord's, his household cluster in Middlesex, only ten transitions, and that, together with the immediate refusal of the electors when V\han wanted to re-compose him on another stock, his burning seems to have been taken from the elan that was so evident in Bombay.
In contrast with that, the estex university has joie de live in bones.
On the cricket game, he doesn't treat it and his behavior outside the cross symbolizes the recently converted car with a shock on four wheels on the exhibiting day of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He went out with easily sorrows and clearly shocking, but as the first thing he took out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his co-operator, who soon followed it to ask him excitedly, "You saw it?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its middle-a-a-smith surroundings on the outdoor games that seem to be pronounced, spreads and burns self-consciously and handsomely.
Choosing a right person is one thing, choosing the right time is different.
Maybe it's just an artist of choice.
I personally claim that Bopara gets his chance now, but I don't want to say that Shah'de exhibit, if, as the cylon tea sheets indicate, it'll be he who will play this next weekend.
Business cars carrying flights in the work - and fighting against al-Kaida
With the buses full of Iraqish flights from Syria, they started to come to Bagdad yesterday and to get refugees to which money has come or has expired the time of validity of the vision, and others who hoped that the city would return to the normal life.
Some have even returned to fight with the weapons who have disappeared them from their homes.
The Mansur Bus Reviews were already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government convoy on bus tutum, full of volcanoes from Syria and Jordan, who returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing a lot of doctors in Bagdad," said Sabah al-Kubaysi, Sunnit doctor.
"Today I came back for what I saw in the television and about what I read in newspapers, for what happened in Bagdad and how safe it is now.
"They say that the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people," he said, "which thinks of the Cheese military of the military spirit of Muda al-Sadra, who temporarily commanded his people to break the battle.
Casim al-Atwani, an eighty-year-old Cheese artist from the major Sunniti-Amaria, returned with his two kids because he couldn't renew Syrian vision and because there was no way for Iraq to work.
His neighbors in America called him by helping the local household with the support of the American Army helped Al-Kaida out of its positions on the west of the capital, and encouraged him to return.
One of the new coming from Jordan is the leader of the Sunnith and Sheitian village, which from his home in Sleikh in the north Bagdad, has dismissed the granate attack after he invited his companions to rise against Al-Kaida.
He came back to fight.
"I assume a few of my friends called and told me that he was divorced in Sleikh Milici against Al-Kaida and that he was able to support me and my boys.
That's why I came back today," said the twenty-year Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many talked about the attractiveness of the calmness in the main town after strengthening the American military presence and the growth of the local "groups of public citizens", which are armed in their hands by the side of the American Army, protects their fourth.
But more about the fact that there was a return of obstruction around the vision and the rest of money in Damascus, where more than 1,3 million Iraqites have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 15-year-old father of three children, expressed the voice of a suspicion divided between the flights that Núri al-Maliki, the Sheit Prime Minister, requested the Syrian Government to defeat the restrictions to the vision of flights and thus brought them back.
According to the available data, more than two and a half million people fled before Iraqian sectoral murderers.
"All was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressed the government to stop giving the Iraqians a vision to have to go to Iraq," said the Sunnith deputy.
"I can't believe the government that supports the criminals who burned me after my leave of my house."
The partial deal for weak violence is the fact that sunnites have been extracted from shit and in contrast, which reduces pressure in many places.
Anxiety is shown that the sudden invasion of flights will refresh the sectoral pressure and will lead to another fight.
Small Sarska, good education
The smallest social country of Germany plays a leading role in education, even highlights the international concentration of its high schools.
Only in one educational area, Saarland is concerned about the same lack of Germany.
"A man who does not come from Sarska, I explained that we are no French yesterday," this self-ironic password appears in Sargy at the 50th anniversary of this smallest gender country.
Instead, France and Luxembourg play a great role in monitoring the Education of the Colin Institute for Economic Research (IW) at the fifth place.
High schools have so traditionally cooperated with surrounding countries.
The University in Saarbrücken was founded to France in 1948.
To this day, students can finish the study with two or even three diplomas.
That is why the high share of students corresponds to 15,6%.
Because the excessive number of Sara's children is to take a high school - many of them and without a gimnasia study.
"In Sarska, a professional educational system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, IW educational expert.
More than every fifth youth gets the right to study on a professional activity, Sargy is more than 7% above the German average.
In comparison with the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Sargy to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunities to study two at the same time are the best in all Germany, regarding the population of the other.
Despite practically oriented education and a standing request, the number of engineering engineering engineering dependents has increased in the past years.
Therefore, the Serbian Ministry of School has now ordered high schools to create a promotion campaign for engineering.
"When Pisa first studied, we have been conducting a number of reforests at general educational schools," says the speaker of the Ministry of School.
Therefore, the government carried out comparative tests throughout Germany.
To start learning as soon as first, the last year of the mother school is free - a model that also collects other sex countries.
If the outcome of the race is very improved, they will show the future comparative studies.
In 2003, Pisa study was decreased from 29% to 20%.
However, Sargy hasn't improved as much as other gender countries.
Batteries can count better.
And to disappoint Sarska Studio Pisa is inequality to the knowledge of foreign languages - in other cases, Sarska could just point in this area.
The language of the neighbors is also obligation in the gimnasiums - even though the Saars people are not French.
Wave moves hours
What they don't see will go in Venezuela other than in the rest of the world.
9. It allows President Hugo Chavez to move hours in this South America for a half hours of the hour.
In Spain, there's a funny figure between the Chavez.
The official magazine of Veniceuela reported that the hours, according to the new law, would take place at least four and a half hours.
The South America state will be this step in the time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chavez, an enemy of the United States, has made his decision outside the way that the United States have introduced the world's division of timelines throughout the hours.
Moreover, in the middle of local time, Chavez announced that, due to the cup of hands, he breaks the relationships with neighbor Colombia.
This left nationalist declared that until Alvaro Uribe is preserved by President Columbia, it would not have any relations with him nor with the Colombian government.
"I can't, because of my self-respect," said Chavez, which promotes the reform of the constitution, which the citizens of this land must vote in the Sunday reference.
This reform would strengthen his power in the country.
The Uribe decided to reject Chavez's authorisation to negotiate in Cookie with Marxist Rebels on the release of hands.
The Uri's decision on Venezuela "flyed in the face" criticized Uribe Chavez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chavez.
The new mobile call here has been called "Why no these calass" (Why are you not quiet anymore?) - so it sounds that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
The Spanish King Juan Carlos expressed her, who, on the recent Iberoamerican top summit, the voice notes of this Left Populist so much that he was silent in this way.
Germans in 2007 are threatened by lower payments
According to the predicts, the German employees are threatened for years to decrease real salary even through a strong conjuncture.
Experts have made their pessimistic predicts from a whole series of debts.
According to the estimates of Hanse Böckler, employees can actually calculate in 2007 by receiving a lower salary than in the latest year.
"The wines a small increase in payments, increase in taxes from added value and increase in prices for food and energy," said the newspaper Bild Gustav Horn from the IMK research institution (Institut for Macroeconomy and Conjunkturforschung).
The new staff burden may also be expected in the unemployment insurance.
The Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück, newspaper Newe Osnabrücker Zeitung, said that the planned reduction of employment contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable for the new year.
However, the Social Agency should no longer fall into such unfortunateness so that she should ask for loans or contributions from the youth, feeling the newspapers of this social democracy policy.
On Wednesday, the price explosion of food and agricultural products caused inflation on its highest state in the last 13 years.
In the annual comparison, the price was totally three per cent.
Venus is the hell-double Earth.
Despite its life of enemy atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar than it was assumed yet. The European cosmic sondae Venus Express on Venus mentioned the vineyards that also appear in the winter on the Earth: the flashes in the atmosphere and the cruel faith in the field.
Almost three decades ago, the men think that they are on Venus.
Now the European sond Venus Express has made evidence - captured electromagnetic wings on the surface of the atmosphere. On Venus, they fly from darkness to darkness at about 56 km high, wrote in the Nature Christopher Russell magazine from the California University in Los Angeles.
According to a famous theory, the original mass could produce life on Earth through the lights. Bourers have seemed to have resulted in reactions in the ocean leading to the origin of aminooxide, the basic stones of life.
"If there was sometimes life there, it had to be very long," explains Sean Solomon from Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there would be something living on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about 100 times higher than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures about 500 °C.
"It's likely a hell of the Earth, but it's a two," Russell said.
Why Venusha, which is so similar to the earth, started to develop completely differently, is the fundamental question of the mission of Esa.
Since the beginning of the 90s, no sondae was sent exclusively after Venus study, the start of Venus Express in November 2005 was in the research of this planet.
According to the latest results of research that approached a number of articles of Nature magazine, Venus’s unity in the solar system was not only highlighted.
"They also showed that our neighbor's planet is more like the Earth than it was supposed to be," Esa said.
Besides the already known faiths in the north field, the people found dark faith in the southern field, which is essentially touched.
This phenomenon holds air flows on the north side of the earth, writes a research team under Guiseppe Pi ́oni from the Italian Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The other internal planet of our solar system is the same weight as the Earth, and with an average of 12 100 km is almost the same.
This planet marked as Jitrenka or Dinner will run the sun for 225 days.
However, around its own axes turns much smaller. One day on Venus is 243 days on Earth.
Although Venezuela does not reach the surface temperature by 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars of the Earth, both planets have appeared after very similar submines.
The waters were on both sides, but the earth remained in the oceans, while it came out from Venice to the universe.
While carbon oxide on Earth is connected to the Earth in carbonates, the Venus is a frequency of the atmosphere.
Köhler takes place in the meeting of Merkel with Dalalama
The Social President Köhler requires the end of the parties' disputes for the adoption of a dealam in the office.
He immediately criticized the SPD for its attacks on the office after the mutual meeting in September.
Society President Horst Köhler cares about the news of Germany and calls for a big coalition to finish the weight around the receipt of the Dailylams.
"They shouldn't be presented as a nation that is not unique in this issue," Köhler said to the commercial newspapers of Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed a comprehension for the decision of the German officer Angely Merkel (CDU) to adopt a department in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
Although the Social Chairman stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in the establishment policy, he did not prevent Merkel to stop when it was estimated that it was created a new policy for China.
"The general office did not leave from the traditional Chinese single policy.
China also knows it," Köhler said.
Minister for Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) directly showed his unconcord with the receipt of the Dailylams, and he was attacked by a series of coalics.
Steinmeier moved for otherwise to the "previous" coalition policy.
Dutch-Chinese relations have been deteriorated after receipt of the Dalayalam in the Office of the Office.
Not only the Chinese government dismissed the invitation of the German Minister of Finance of Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to the SPIEGEL magazine, the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministership for both countries was also frozen.
The Chinese president of the Government Wen Jiabao invited the office of Angel Merkel to recognize that the acceptance of the Dalalamy was a mistake.
China does not admit when European policies officially accept Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao highlighted China's position.
The words and actions of the Dalaylam showed that Tibet and other Tibetians, which are also focused on China's territory, are trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns against similar disasters that have gone out in France
Pool battles with the police, the shoots, the cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar disasters that have gone out in France.
We have to do everything so that social insatisfaction in Germany does not grow in the street violence, calling the social ministro inside.
Barikades burned, exhibitors shot in the police with a brochure. After serious troubles of youths in France, the social minister in Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar development in Germany.
"We must take attention to that we also do not create such social pressure that will be in violentity.
We have to take it seriously," said in the Hanver newspaper Neue Press.
Not every young person may be able to compare with a change in sociality.
The Social Government, the country and the foreign are already working on the elimination of problems, said Schäuble.
What doesn't mean the integration of migrants.
"On the summary of integration after the Islam, we mention the first success."
However, the attention is still in place.
Sheuble presently pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German undertakings are not comparable to those French.
In the past nights, they had a young man with the police in the northern areas of Paris, a strong street fight.
Even in Toulouse, she burned cars and public buildings.
The greater integration efforts of the German government requested the president of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the distress in France, Kolat warned against the "effect of imitation".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Yet, it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 years of age who entertain from the family of migrants, the unemployment measure is "extremely high".
Moreover, it is necessary to ensure more studied opportunities.
Colat highlighted, "We have to give the youth on."
The president of the Turkish community, however, added that in Germany there is a higher social control of the family in France.
Moreover, many youths from the family of migrants do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
He asked, "But we have to watch."
We need the youth to allow them to start working and learning.
Meanwhile, she stayed in Paris's place of Villiers-le-Bel very quiet.
There were hundreds of police officers in the board, and over the weather the whirlwind passed through the light.
The authorised authorities reported three arrests and a number of waste waste and cars.
Since yesterday, there are about 1,000 assembled order forces.
Police will include as necessary after visiting Michelle Alliot-Marie.
In anxieties at Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 cops were hurt at night on Tuesday.
The next night, Toulouse's concerns took place.
She has not seen a Sunday transport accident in which two youths have come to life.
According to the first detection of the State representation, the police shall not be guilty of the death of young people.
In Russia, Angely "Obleks"
The office is actually remote output shows that the coal is programming at the end and that we can't even expect anything more from it.
What country does this office actually live in?
After her unfortunate, loudly deceived and poor, we have to find out at the general debate of the Social Snow: not here - not in this country that it should finally be managed.
As it is too focused on the exercise policy, Angela Merkel answered a lot of arrogant.
It's a provincy, she said what she showed that she didn't want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Snow Snow, she obviously predicted all how much it deserves.
From Merkel, he felt no real interest, so feeling for problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblaková" was presented: a political policy that comes out of the finals that run into the forest policy and there only expresses it with milk.
For example, climate protection: without stop, it is praised for the conclusions resulting from the summit in Saint-Andam, but it does not say anymore how the climate objectives are achieved in Germany.
And, at all, such a self-appreciation - so many incorruptibilities would have been forgiven to the president of the CDU two years ago.
It is now limited to a plane of phrases that could increase the pleasure among people.
This approach hurts its pragmatic imid, which doesn't fail because it solves problems.
But in Russia, Angely "Obblek" is the internal political issues of the area.
Child poverty and anxiety of people with low recompense?
It's been a couple of fronts to these topics.
It's noted how often Merkel's rejecting the additive for children.
Merkel must start three times from the beginning so that she may be able to express at least partly correctly.
As soon as things are going to be too specific, it's covered as in a completely alien teren.
Department of Attack
The debate of the Republican Presidents' candidates at Youtube has been deployed in the debate in the case of Emperors of Rudy Giulianicho and Mitta Romney - and both of them must now be afraid of the outside candidate.
The pressure of both candidates is already shown in the first subject.
Mitt Romney predicts his concubine to Rudy Guiliani that he made from New York a "country for illegal movers".
Giuliani Âe reacts with anxiety: "I think his own house was just one such campaign," he replies and predicts the former massachusetts that he personally employed immigrants without documents.
Since the Republican base has no favourite yet, eight presidents are using these debates on CNN primarily to discredit their subsidiarity.
Semi-minute, internet-contracted and transmitted video via Youtube serves only as such a key theme.
"True this isolation policy we enabled Hitler to understand the power," John McCain advises his companion Ron Paul, who, as the only one, promotes the immediate station of armies from Iraq.
The Vietnamese Veterinary McCain doesn't care about his estimates or Romeney, because he refuses to judge the torture method called "Waterboarding", where heating is simulated.
The reactions of the public in St. Petersburg show that the important subject of the campaign does not belong to any war in Iraq, nor to torture methods.
The committee shall be incurred once the conservation of values and the future increase of taxes is refused.
So it'll be shown where the weakness of both of them is.
"I've been wrong on that occasion," he's explained roundly, and he asks the page base and television public for forgiveness that he was still a deceitor of losses in 1994.
Giuliani is in disappointment when it is to be expressed to literal Bible explanation.
Musharaf's first government in civilism
On the day after his department from the position of the superior commander of the Army, the Pakistan Governor Musharaf made a swear by the president.
This ends eight years of military government in Pakistan.
President of Pakistan Parvíz Musharaf made a presidency swear on Thursday, and thus remained in the Office of the president for the next five years.
The Pakistanian television transferred a live ceremonie in the presidential palace in the main city of Islamabad.
Musharaf sweared he would honor the constitution and strive for the good people.
In the middle of his superior commander of the army, he delivered his truster to Ashfaq Kiyani, who was under international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he was captured in an unhealthy military destruction, the former general rules first as a civil head of the State.
By declining from the position of the top commander of armed forces, Musharaf fulfilled one of the main requirements of opposition and Western.
Another central demand is the cancellation of the exceptional status which Musharaf announced on November 3th.
According to Malika Muhammad Qayyum's Supreme State Representative, Musharaf will cancel the exceptional state soon after his swear, and will fulfil the following requirements of the Western.
The highest court of the country which Musharaf, after announced an exceptional status at the beginning of November, had been sent to him by advocates, refused the next week of all reports on the contrary rehabilitation of head of the State of 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed at the attack of the military convoy in the North Vaziristan tribe and four other were hurt.
The speaking army said that the bomb exploded on the street near the border with Afghanistan.
Daddy's crawling back
The glorious German group of seventy years plays again. Three members of the Harmonia group re-covered their electronic syntheses at the concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a sister of the most successful period of the cape.
They've been most famous in the cup.
Then the reported feeling is in the exhibition of three resident ladies, who first look like they're just kidding dinners.
Everyone has a box, cabs, and mainly buttons.
Threety-year-old Dieter Moebius is sitting at the snow white cow.
On his left, he's a seventy-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a cytarr before him.
Threety-seventy-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is focused on synthesizers, is from the view of the walls right.
Everyone contributes to sounds, sometimes even beat.
Sometimes, of course not looking at, a traditional track will occur.
It doesn't seem too bad to men of music.
Among the lovers of the krautrock, he called a revision of the Harmonia capelle of a significant disruption.
One thing here is a point of note: the repeated questions showed that this name is part of the collective report on pop, but it is not so quick to get this chapel painful.
But why could Germany not even celebrate his still living legends of the seventy years?
And especially when you're a musical, wrongly called crautrock, in England and America, it's more than in your own country.
In 2003, when the music business was assigned to the remaining members of the Can Echo Echo Price for Life Work, the hall was full of questionary views of the German pop fans.
Moreover, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked for their presentation to the groups of La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the miracle of the whiskys did not know the border.
Michael Rother sent up on the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts with them as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance home and devotion in the foreign is one thing.
By calling on the Harmonia Chapel, we unfortunately overcome memory, this triumph was only two years, and at that time there was no effect that others had been added to them.
Moebius and Roedelius already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under a promised name Cluster.
In the beginning, they played in the Berlin district of Shaubhoune.
Then in Düsseldorfu, from the economic parts of the grammophone company led to the church.
Rother quickly helped the forcework group, but the story obtained as a cytarist at the Nue! cape, which may have been the most radical German group at that time.
In 1973, Rother followed musicians Cluster capely to the exil in Forstu in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, the ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of the community that fled from the city.
They didn't live here so ideologically as in the commune I, where Roedelius had to be a boy.
It was better life in such a spitzway artistic apartment.
The name for this art is evidently carried out by the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein Single Congregation, whose mark was evidently found in the hall.
Many of this Harmonia kept.
The album was called "Humba from Harmonie" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modesty, the caple suffered by financial pressures.
The collection of rose was not only self-appreciation.
The now issued CD "Live 1974" appeared to have been held at a concert in Griesse before a recordly small, one of the fifty-five.
That time Rothera expressed the desire of the members of Harmonie to be exhausted and exercising opportunity.
For Roedlia and Moebia, it was a completely unrepentant request.
In 1975, the captain announced its department.
Rother ended in the isoterical sfer, and his future, he hit the "Belding Heart" album.
The Capelle Cluster lived again in the 80s, and since that time, it was more successful than Harmonia.
We can be thankful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His recording company Grönland took the goal of Krautrock to take care of as a poetry German contribution to life music.
Capela Neu! was considered Rodellio's only work at that time.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia will run in the Berlin World Culture House.
The outcome of the Woldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
The British, Julian Cope, the old pancake and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler".
The founder of Love Parade is also involved, Dr. Motte.
That's what we planned a total width of the impact of the craftrock on the future pop music.
The empty place of the glorious group will just fill Harmonia.
Brian Ena, which is made by the most beautiful sounds in the room: "The unique true music, it belongs to the future."
There are images on which is the manufacturer of Harmonia in the agricultural seat.
It also contributes to the creation of legends to the creation of other black-white photographs, which now are the devices of divote-contained cabs.
Before they are three veteraners who have re-emprovization.
I'm not going to blow the microphones on the warehouse and bubbles anymore, so that these never heard self-constructed tons are out of the tools.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technology to be buried.
It doesn't change the congregation of the World Culture House.
Under the lead of Barbara Morgensterns, the sounds are shaped under the darkness and in one beautiful place are emfaticly sing "Aaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was a very ological idea.
It never was about rock.
The roots are more than in blues found in musical high schools (Can), in ≥ (Kraftwork) or in refuge from artificial and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who calls "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia doesn't even let it out of the calm.
Even so, it's most evident that it's thinking reasonably on the scene.
Where's the music starting, and when's it finished?
This person's question will be prepared for nerves or will make him sure that he lives in a lowly moment of happiness.
Richard Gere isn't enough cynical
The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Peace had shown two movies on the Balkan war.
But no one of them is convinced.
The preview of the films is too big attitude to the activity and shooting, or are too sensitive.
The Hunting Party doesn't prohibit any hero like Richard Gere.
Good news as the first: War crimes Karadit and Youth are still hidden in the Balkan Mountains, but right there, in the shadow territory of the Bosnian War, Richard Gere's herd will be cut off.
In the last days, we lost this beautifulest man in the eighty years, not only because he played in many pleasant, serious roles in women's films, but in connection with his printing teams on Buddhism theme, they will make a man enjoying another movie with this herd.
Yet, Richard Gere is the most strong argument to follow The Hunting Party - Where is the hunting party benefits (Why must the names of the films be so long and broken today?).
Gere gives an artificial execution. His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically who Gere could happen if the sentence and the movies were not so merciful: a man who has his best years ago, but as concerns, a similar memory still keeps a certain cautious effect.
But the Hunting Party is along with the German movie Mörderischer Peace, which also comes into the cine this week, just by continuing a number of unfortunate films on the war on Balkan.
With the movie Mörderischer Peace, we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save Serbian girl from the Kosovo shooter, how one of them loves her.
Although it is grateful that the Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this TV movie is changed too soon in shooting and action.
The movie will stay a lot like the Cobru 11 series, even without a distance, but for the war.
The Hunting Party's film is expressed to examine why the Balkan War has not yet been able to check the reality of a good movie.
The story of three American war reporters, which seem to be "slave", Serbian top war crime, could be able to be a new "Apocalypse" at another time and under the lead of another register and scenario (here is Richard Shepard killing).
Both stories are surprisingly like that small groups go into the forest to do something that the army is not able, but their ways become the way to foolishness.
One of the failures of the Hunting Party film is that Simon Hunt is not the looking and emotional cycle represented at the beginning.
Instead, his proposal is also a romantic affair with the murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party can finally be able to describe after reporters in the last five minutes of the film will lead to what happens to NATO, and to all the criminals of the world in the past five years: to catch criminals and to leave him a righteous recompense of the Bosnian Muslims.
It's so contrary to the logic of the film creation that it would be worth returning to the International Court in Haag.
On the other hand, this film has a deep human message.
It condemns that Karagnet and Mladić are still in freedom, and submits Americans and Franceses (and they are extremely united) that they are not adequately enhanced on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and bad are sometimes so similar to a woman that attacks us with Brecht's fear.
It relates to the tree mask of the Asian demon on the workshop of the writer: "I feel compassionate to see the rocks on my head, noting: how bad it is to be."
In the films like the Hunting Party, it is exactly such a crazy head that indicates how helpful it is to be good.
This problem is not limited only to the theme of war on Balkan.
Recently, these newspapers wrote that all the Hollywood films about Iraq were a big failure.
This can be added only: No good film on South Africa has ever been drawn.
Almost applies: When the star is running after the crisis ́i or crossing on the mine field, the film will appear like the Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the limit of the violation with Angelina Jolie or the blood diamond with DiCapri.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close to time.
Finally, they had to run decades before Hollywood could run a good movie about Hollywood - Schindler's list.
A lot of films must obviously be watched - films that today are considered as classic Vietnamese works - "Love of Jelens", "Apocalyps" or "Followed news" - were not celebrated in any case as mysterious works.
But maybe today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The scenarios then do not have the ability that is needed to correct good stories.
"By or not" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin haven't yet known how a terrible way the Nazi regime was actually ruled.
Maybe someone shouldn't want to be good if he wants to make good movies.
Maybe he has to create a scarcastick-shark-sharp-screened artificial view as the Romans Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was questioned on the parallel between his historic romance "Limpryer's dictionary" and "Balkan war", he said, "The property is only that some things never change.
Great villages will be very dangerous, people will be killed in a terrible way, and there will also be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust approaches the criticism for the refusal of olympias
The decline of anxiety from the organizing of the annual olympics in Hamburk has resulted in the criticism of policy and economics.
Many people want to continue to fight for the heavy hers in the water.
But Von Beust's calling for reality in a chance.
Mr. Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, in the middle of this decision, "with regard to enterprise for fun."
No other project recently has proved such a great motivation in the city as a olympical idea.
"Without this goal, this sports political ambition would not be possible to maintain in such a high measure."
Schmidt-Trenz invited Senat to not bury this project, but created a new concept, "coming from a changed time plan."
Starsta Ole von Beust remained in the middle of his previous statements, which the olympical ambitions of Hamburk at least 2028 are unrealistic.
"No Hamburk, but the German Olympic sport union will decide about the olympical candidature," said von Beust to the WE _ ONLINE newspaper.
He pointed out that at the beginning of Sporto's union will decide on Mnich's candidate for the winter games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that with the 2028 time plan we have no realistic chance."
However, this dream hasn't ended yet, says von Beust.
The Hamburian sports spot (HSB) signed the vocabulary of von Beust.
It will be the idea that Hamburk doesn't want to save the Olympics in the next 20 years.
"It's still too soon to destroy the chances by means of the plans already in this early phase to be buried," said President HSB, Günter Ploss in the middle.
The detention would be in contrast with the responsibility of the Senate Boss, which he made on the Value of the General German High School Sport Union.
Von Beust here has not announced the candidate to Hamburk at the University in 2015 as a refund for the organizing of olympics.
The High School Sports of Hamburk's association just nominated the next week to the candidate city.
The SPD Fraction in the Hamburg Parliament of the Senate stated that it was worth a time that could be used for the building of apartments in Hamburg.
"The widow of Klein Grasbrook was the Senate for years, because he set up to organize olympias and the building of apartments," said SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quist.
While the SPD for Klein Grasbrook continued planning olympy with the whole use of the whole for residents, the CDU set on the "olympic factor".
The storage of the annual Olympical Game in 2012 has exposed his time in Hamburg a big surprise.
Hamburk, but he's gone to Lipskia.
They're not Warhol's boxes.
The one who connects the expressions of Sweden and wooden beds doesn't think of Andy Warhol, but about Ike.
Or yes?
Tree beds currently produced in Sweden are on the list of Warhol's works of dark shadow.
Most of his in the list of ninety-four "Brillo Boxes" type Stockholm are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" expressed doubts about the rights of the Warhol "Brillo Boxes" of 1968, the internal research of the Museum Moderna Museet in Stockholm with an exhibition that brought discouragement; six "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 Museum Moderna Museet gave by his former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - as the number of other "Brillo Boxes" types of Stockholm, which are on the international artistic market in the course.
Prejudiced events are a mature, mature string of artistic and couraging actions.
Warhol produced his first Brillo box in New York in 1964, painted wood beds based on the red-modrobial design of paper boxes of Brillo.
The exhibition of his work in the Modern Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo sticks from the carton. They did not enter (from the financial parts) from Warhol, but were added directly from Brillo.
It wasn't about artificial works, but about their proposals, just the exhibitions.
Warhol, obviously, also allowed in 1968 to produce a few trees of Brillo beden in Sweden, but they are not exhibited in the Modern Museet.
Today the Witnesses are now talking about fifteen beds that were rightly entered into the artistic and architectural history as authorised originals - "Andy Warhols Brillo Boxy" with the label Type Stockholm.
Some of them were charged for more than $100,000.
The problem is now that the Legendary Director of Pontus Hultén Museum has falsely claimed that in 1968 it was made in Sweden and was set up about a hundred kidneys, then warhol left him.
In Vesheit 105 Hultén Beden were produced in Malmo for the exhibition in Petrohrada in 1990.
Warhol was three years after death.
Lars Byström, the top conservator Moderna Museet, examined outside the six Brillo boxes that are in the property of the museum, including three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private assembly, from which two were prepared in Sweden in 1968 and after their white boards were filled with base color and rounded with oil colour.
In contrast, from the 1990 copy structure, it was shown that the color was designed without the previous basic nature directly on the crossboard - besides the acryl and not the oil colour.
"They were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from Warhola's official brillo boxes," he told the director Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the organization of Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York doesn't come to other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six of its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copy".
In July, the Authentication Board has announced that these "consequent accusations", which have been brought up in the case of boxes with mythical work, will be concerned.
But the organization still remains in an inevitable silence.
Rebellion soldiers in Manile are delivered
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers who were ope in a hotel in Manile and asked the president Glorie Macapagal Arroy to leave.
Antonio Trillanes, who exhibited the president's manipulation and corruption at elections, told reporters at the hotel that he refused the responsibility for bleeding.
The soldiers of devotion to the government before attacked with the larve gas to the hotel.
A few hours ago, about two ten soldiers were up in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood before the court because of a deadly trial of revenge in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used an engine to flee with 30 sympathys.
The military police who had to watch him apparently passed on his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and asked the president Glorie Macapagal Arroy to leave.
The government of the loyal units closed around the selected hotel.
The president called for a seat of the security cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales judged soldiers' actions.
"The people have enough," said Triallnes.
