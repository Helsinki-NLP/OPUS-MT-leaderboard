Spectacular spring in "wingsuit" above Bogota
The sportsman Jhonathan Florez spent Thursday from a helicopter above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
A wingsuit equipped (a combination of sticks), it passed up to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, with more than 3000 metres of height, where many baths were gathered to observe its exploit.
A black box in your car?
While the United States travel network planners have difficulty to find the money necessary to repair the autoroute infrastructure in decrepitation, many are those who interview a solution in the form of a small black box fixed above the board table of your car.
The devices, recording all thousands of parking by a car and sending information to the officers, are in the centre of a controversy at Washington and in the Governing Boards of Planning to manage the obsolete system of financing of the main American roads.
The sector, generally without interest in the planning of large axes, suddenly caused a strongly encouraged debate and moved aliens.
Freedoms have joined groups to press the government to use the small boxes to keep the track of the thousands you will park, and probably from the way you have, and then use the information to edit a project of tax law.
The Tea Party is attracted.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of private life.
And while the members of the Congress are not able to agree to know whether to continue, several States have not been expected.
They ask how, during the next decade, they can go to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of thousands of parcourus.
Thousands of cars have already shiped these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for a experimental wire.
This is really essential for our nation.
"It is not as if we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director-General of Southern California's Governments, which provides that the State begins to register the miles of parking by each Californian car from 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
It's here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the Highway Trust Fund of the country, financed with the taxes paying the Americans to the pump, is financially dry.
The Americans are buying so much of essence as before.
Cars can park more than thousands with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18,4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Political men are obliged to increase the tax, even 1 hundred, while the prices of the essence are high.
"The tax on the extent is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a specialist of transport policies at the Minnesota University.
His State has recently made trackers on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
"This is the most logical alternative at long term," he said.
Wonks calls this for the costs of use at the kilometre.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces the libraries of quotedine, since taxes could use conduct habits in order to reduce the compression and gas emissions, for example.
Californian planners are interested in the system because they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the ambitional laws of the State on climate heating.
But representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), president of the Committee on Transports of the Room of Representatives, stated that he also considered it as the most sustainable long-term alternative.
The parties of the free market of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of paying the drivers for a milk.
"It is not just a tax in a large black crowd," said Adrian Moore, President of the Policy on the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they are gained.
The movement is also supported by two former American secretaries in Transports who, in a report of 2011, urged the Congress to go on the way of payment to miles.
The American Senat approved a 90 M$ pilot project last year, which would have brought about 10 000 cars.
But the Chamber Presidency killed the proposal, replying to the concerns of rural islators representatives of electors who have to attend a lot of miles every day to return to their work or to the city.
However, several states and large cities make progress.
The most determined is the Oregon, which mobilised 5 000 drivers to conduct the most important experience in the country.
These cars will be paid to the State of Kilometrical costs rather than to the extent taxes.
Nevada has already implemented a pilot project.
The city of New York thinks about one.
I'Nois trys to test a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which include 17 travel agencies involved in road transport in states far off the coast, is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) study how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where approximately 50 volunteers have recently equipped their car from a machine, the drivers were concerned that the government could follow their smaller facts and gestures.
"Big Brother's concerns and such things are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads to the strategic management of the performance at the Nevada Transport Department.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the test, Nevada's ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into entire location devices."
It is not necessary to build a huge and comprehensive infrastructure that will be inevitable to maintain the records of people's daily halls and arrivals.
Nevada is a part of some States who are now going to find an abordable ́ that would allow the State to know how many thousands park a car, but without knowing the place or the exact time.
If we can do that, Khan's got, the citizens will be more able.
Searching for this has brought some State agencies to call for a small start-up in California named True Mileage.
From the origin, the company was not intended to help carriers paying taxes to States.
She was trying to perceive the market of auto-insurance, in which the drivers would pay according to their milestone.
But the devices that it tested have made the planners of the large axes because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information downloaded pseudically by modem.
"The people will be more inclinated to do this if you don't record their speed and not locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director-General of True Mileage.
Great errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less honourable means and less intrusive methods to process.
In the Oregon, planners are trying to experience by offering different choices to cars.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose to have no equipment at all, prefering to pay a forfait based on the average number of thousands of parkhouses by all the residents of the State.
Other States hope to sell the concept to unbelieving citizens by allowing devices to make it more, rather than enough.
In the city of New York, transport operators are trying to develop a taxation device that would also be equipped to pay stationing costs, to provide a “payment to drive” insurance and to create real-time data data from other drivers that carriers could use to avoid the embustment.
"Within cars would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them," a document on urban amendment stated.
However, some transport planners ask whether the whole debate on miles payment is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission of the San Francisco Batch Zone, the responsibility states that the Congrès could very simply manage the Highway Trust Fund's failure by increaseing the cost taxes.
A single or annual additional tax may be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and on other vehicles whose use is not much basic, so everyone pays its right part.
"It is not necessary to take a radical surgery when aspirine is simply needed," said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and business at the committee.
If we do this, hundreds of million cars will be concerned about the protection of their private life and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four inedicts in listening
The musician hasn't been surprised this year.
From The Next Day, in January, he concocked a lux redition scheduled for 4 November, with several inedits.
Four have already sealed on the Toilet.
The announcement of the presentation of a new album of David Bowie had left everyone pantois.
On his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he said that a new album would come out in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disk, Reality, date of 2003) and too rare appearances in public, the musician proved that we could still count on it to make the pop scene clear.
A party for his fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one tour in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke so planned to edit this album on 4 November.
For the occasion, he concocked a real party for his fans.
This redition, titled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, inevitable studio sessions and releases, as well as a DVD containing the four already opened clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three songs in the Deluxe edit, five specially opened songs for the occasion, and two releases.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful covered in a video.
There is each one of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: photos and pockets, a book to share its own initiatives, a book with words...
And, especially, he gives an advance of his new Atomica title, typically in the vineyard of The Next Day, with very advanced guitars and a well-controlled rock election.
Inedits are already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to devote her charmes.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the toilet.
The Informer is double-faced: an anxiety intro before a horse that gradually relaxed to leave a pop ballade.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Rocket Man of Elton John, or even to Gravity?
With this enjoyed title, the song is in any case in its element when he has no more feet on earth.
Space Oddity, next to, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The riffs of seeking, sending, give the desire to leave the Earth.
Bowi enjoys playing the cameon with these titles: Info tour tour, a man boarded, potential martian...
He dissimulates and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt various personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his persons Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder that he had a mask at hand so in the photograph of the campaign The Invitation to the Travel Mark Louis Vuitton, whose new face is covered.
It will appear in one of their advertising places, spread from 10 November.
The Defence Minister, Rob Nicholson, insisted to say that the wounded soldiers were not summaryly released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civil life.
Appealed by the Liberals and Neo-Democrates to the Communities Room, Mr Nicholson assured that before their release, the members of the army followed a transition plan with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life and no of them is released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the Government to economy money by not allowing vulnerable soldiers - which do not comply with the rule of the "University of the Service" of the Army requireing the staff to be able to carry out a number of different tasks - to achieve the 10-year acceptability period required for retirement.
In particular, they quoted two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including the last Friday of a soldier freed.
Caporal David Hawkins, a reservist in London in Ontario, has been released from the army despite his request to remain a year more to get a completely indexed retraite.
His case occurred after Caporal Glen Kirkland, who said before a parliamentary committee, last month, that he had been moved to the outcome before he was ready because he did not respond to the rule of universality of the service.
Mr. Hawkins highlighted that a soldier could be prepared to go out with consultation plans and meetings, but that it was totally different than the fact that he wanted to leave the ranges.
"I told them that I was not ready," he said during an interview with the Canadian Press Thursday.
I asked for months if there was a way to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major battles in Afghanistan, the army determines how large it can give the vulnerable soldiers who want to stay in the streets but who are not capable of fighting.
In accordance with the current rules, heavyly wounded soldiers have up to three years to restore themselves.
If they do not respond to the criteria for foreign explosions, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to the Parliament indicates that 199 of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons have not reached the duration of service required for retirement.
The liberal password on ancient fighters, Jim Karygiannis, requested the reintegration of Caporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while the neo-democrate Jack Harris claimed the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney placed on tablets to launch an animated series
The American Media and Divertising Group Disney decided to privilege tablets to its own TV chains for the next outcome of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from 24 November on the watchdisneyjunior.com website or via its application for phones and tablets.
His global launch on Disney group chains was planned only in 2014, detailed its Disney Junior Division.
The animated drawing, intended for children of 2 to 7 years, is the adventure of the chat of Callie, sheriff of a city of the West American, where it makes the order with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two stories of 11 minutes.
"Interview with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, president loaded digital products by Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the quoted.
This type of experience enters the efforts of Disney to "expand the life duration of its series and build new relationships with its public through digital platforms that are more important," he said.
A weekly survey by Common Sense Media showed an explosion of the use of mobile devices for young children in the United States: 38% of less than 2 years have already been used for a tablet or a phone, and 72% of the less than 8 years, respectively, against 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of American monitoring
Edward Snowden, the American Information Service Denunciator, said that he was willing to go to Berlin to witness before the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not provide responses on their activities.
German Deputy Hans-Christian Stropbele met Thursday Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he benefits from the right of asylum, to discuss his witnessing in Germany.
In a letter that the Member had presented to the media in Berlin Friday, Mr Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts was positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a fleeting and seeks to punish the political speech with ambitions against which it is impossible to defend."
However, saying the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could convince the US government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint submitted by the American Ministry of Justice, it is accused of spending and flighting of goods of the State.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, minister of the German Interior, said on the Online Time: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German responsibles, we will make it possible."
The relations between the United States and Germany were tested after complaints that NSA had sent to listen to the phone from German Channel Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opermann, the member of the Parliamentary Group who oversees foreign secret services, pointed out that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, "without put it in danger and completely destroying relations with the United States", it was necessary to benefit.
Mr. Ströbele, Mr. Vert German, took a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on Twitter account.
During his visit in Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Stropbele said that Mr. Snowden, the lawyer of the former consultant of the NSA, could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden had witnessed in Germany, he should be assured that he would be in "security" there, said the Member.
Mr Snowden wrote in his letter that he had made an "severe and supported" persian campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the world's reaction to "the act of political expression".
The citizens of the world and the higher responsibility, including the United States, believed that the revelation of an unexplainable permanent monitoring system was useful.
The letter forwards a cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive television
Cogeco Cable subscribeds could have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and the video service on request Netflix via their television in a future that is not so remote.
The Cogeco branch reported Thursday that she was currently conducting preliminar tests of the beta version of this platform with some of her users.
"This will enable us to evaluate more convictive interfaces and more options," explained the President and head of the Cogeco Director, Louis Audet, in interview.
Cogeco Cáble thus embeds the step to his competitors, such as Bell, even though the Cogeco branch has no specific date yet in what the new platform has been handled.
"You must adapt and change or resist the change and failure," Mr. Audet stressed.
The last purpose remains to offer tools to which our clients are not currently accessed.
The Rogers telecommunications manager already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been quoted, could be regulated.
In the United States, the popular video service says to be discussed with some major cablo distributors so that its service is available through their distribution platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also welcomed the announcement made by the Government of Harper during its talk of the Trone on 16 October.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to provide customers the opportunity to pay card services.
"This is about two and a half years ago that we say that the idea of force consumers to buy significant chains, it doesn't work," Mr. Audet said.
However, it hopes that the consultations conducted by the Council of Radio Diffusion and Canadian Telecommunications (CRTC) will take place on interesting recommendations.
"It will have to take a new form of reference from these discussions to define our new Canadian cultural policy in the field of television," said Cogeco's p.d.
The CRTC has taken consultations to the public since last week and should continue with the industry at the next time.
On the side of the results, Cogeco indicated that a net benefit of 43.8 million to the fourth quarter, or 82 million by action.
This is a recycling compared to the net benefit of 44.9 million, or 83 million by action, from the same period last year.
The enterprise established in Montreal explains this recycling by the costs of abortion related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquised the Atlantic Broadband cablo distributor, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the failure in Portugal.
In the last December, the Montreal Society also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider established in Vancouver, for the amount of 526 million.
As regards Cogeco's income, they experienced a growth of 41.5% to the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net benefit of its main branch, Cogeco Câble, was 43.9 million, or 90 million by action, in comparison to 45.7 million, or 93 ≥ by action, from the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable income progressed by 45% to reach 470,4 million.
The company lost 15 237 clients during the fourth quarter.
However, for the 2013 financial year, the number of Cogeco Cable clients increased 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about seeing the number of such fluctuating clients.
For me, this is not the change of trend, he noticed.
It varies from a trimester to another with a very living competition.
Horse in bovine products
Heavy meat was determined in boxes of egg-based products, sold by two small British distribution teachers, today announced by the food hygiene agency.
Routine tests showed that products, prepared in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained a horse DNA of 1 to 5%.
"As the horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been presented in the product," explained the British Agency.
A scandal on the presence of horse meat in cooking places was in Europe at the beginning of the year, after tests made in Ireland.
According to the reviews of the European Commission, France was the country most touched by the presence of this type of meat in products intended to contain only bovine products.
A division between two vehicles made four hurt, early Friday, on the road 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 hours, a carman who was in the north direction in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost the control of his vehicle and gained a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four of the two vehicles were hurt, but they were not afraid of their lives.
The normality was returned at 6:00 p.m., Friday.
Frontier Airlines intends to pay hand baggage
Frontier Airlines intends to pay up up to $100 to passengers who carry hand baggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines intends to start paying up to $100 for a hand baggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its Friday announcement, she indicated that passengers could carry the unopened canet with them to the decline of the plane.
The new hand baggage costs relate to the baggage in the highest level, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said she would pay $25 if the costs were paid forward and $100 if the travelers would pay only once at the boat door.
The Frontier password, Kate O'Malley, indicated that the $100 were planned to encourage travelers to pay the costs forward.
"We don't want to pay this price," she explained.
Air companies began to pay the first and second baggage recorded in 2008.
The passengers who were trying to avoid these costs put as much as they could in hand baggages in the higher halts, so there was often no more place in these baggages.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers carry less than things on board.
O'Malley said that these new costs would not really serve to collect money.
It is to make the most faithful clients of Frontier understanding that it becomes more difficult to find the place in the higher levels.
The passengers who buy their ticket on the site of the air company will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger who makes the cup at a border gate could carry a ship free, while the next person in the box could pay $100 for a similar ship.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier registration site and procedures are being changed to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before they arrive to the door.
Frontier's hand baggage costs will not be applied before season, although no date has been fixed.
The passengers often rush about the costs of baggage and other costs, but the air companies love them.
They believe that the costs of maintenance of baggage are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
Many people in Wall Street view the cost of baggage as a sign that shows that air companies are paying enough dear to cover the air travel cost after years of loss.
However, many of them have not touched the bathroom costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first baggage costs three years ago, and the low-cost company Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company that imposes such costs is the Hungarian Wizz Air company, told the consultant to Jay Sorenen Air Air company, which follows nearly the extra costs.
In a report of December 2011, he considered that the expenditure of the spirit’s hand baggage reported $50 M per year.
Sorensen, an ancient frame of Midwest Airlines, recently traveled on the Spirit and asked what he would find at the boat door when passengers would discover the costs of hand-hand baggage imposed by the company.
"I have never seen a so fluid shipment procedure of all my professional career," he said.
I was trying to see teeth springs and a bullet springing at the door.
The airplane was full, said he, “the passengers are ascended to board at the speed of the light.”
Frontier also makes as a Spirit and applies costs of $2 for a coffee, a tea, a soda or a juice of fruit.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can carry the unopened canet with them, and those who take the coffee can be reserved freely.
It will always distribute water free.
US Airways quickly tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after the passengers had complained and no other large air company had followed.
The decision of the Frontier to pay hand baggage costs when passengers do not buy their ticket directly with the aircraft is his last effort to encourage customers to go to their site.
Aircompanys pay online travelers as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each sale billet.
This encouraged all aircraft companies to encourage passengers to buy directly with them instead of addressing to a online travel agency.
Frontier has, however, gone far away in this area.
In September, she began to offer only half thousands of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket through a online travel agency.
Wednesday, she reduced the miles of 25% on a travel.
Thus, a border travel of 1,000 miles bought to a online travel agency would make it possible to win 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat forward only if they buy their ticket directly on the frontier site.
Frontier has a faithful customer in his original town, Denver, but her activity recycles and loses money.
Income falled by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% during the first quarter, the financial results of its mother's company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic tried to recover Frontier's finance by selling the air company.
NSA causes a "internal error" and not the computer pirates for its site's panel
The National Security Agency working in the shadow stated Friday that it was a bug that caused the panel of its public site for a few hours, not hackers as some said to it online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight because of an internal error occurred during a planned update," said the spinner agency in a email statement.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The claims that the panel was due to a distribution of service deni [DSD] are false.
Before this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been packed for at least 6 hours, and some users can't still access the site.
Soon, a NSA portfolio indicated to ABC News that the agency's internal network was not "no totally" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, explained the password.
At least one online hacktivist group has claimed to be responsible for the NSA site panel by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks are intended to install a target site until the servers are overloaded and the site is broken down.
Cyber-tactic is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to pass into the internal network of the system.
The NSA's previously secret, a time referred to as the No Search Agency, was under the fire of projectors and was strongly criticized during the past months after its large monitoring programmes at national and foreign level, which are part of the secret files of the NSA stolen to the Agency and divulgated by the old consultant in the NSA, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the Agency has caused many speculations that the incidence of this evening was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its ports on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that had the building sold it to promotors who would transform it into student residences.
Three hundred fifty people worked at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have not yet found new jobs.
Delta promises not to let his employees fall.
Employers came to meet employees directly at the place, individually meeting employees to evaluate their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the regional director of the workshops of the Delta Hotels, Félix Bisson.
The closure of Delta is involved in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that was owner of that bathroom had choices to make.
Or he re-invested in the bathroom to continue operating it, so there were tens of million investments while competition is very feroz, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Whether he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, titler of the Transat Tourism Chairman at UQAM Sciences School.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the next months, such as the Crown Plaza that will become a residence for elderly people.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will see the day of two years.
For Titan PDG, "the Goodyear Amiens Buying Project starts with zero employed"
After casting the spoon with fracces in January for the partial recovery of the Godyear of Amiens-North site promised to closure, Maurice Taylor, the PDG of the American Pneumatic Titan, is now ready to save 333 jobs on the 137.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Productive Resurrection, had already announced it on Monday 21 October.
After refusing to purchase the company in January, you will come back today.
You had spoken of violent attacks and insults, talking about "so-disant ov's", which "work three hours a day" and "faus" syndicates, viewing the CGT.
We don't understand this face.
Is it to make Mr. Montebourg pleasure?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr Montebourg, he is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment too.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when we work in other countries eight hours in France.
In India, China and many other countries, ten to twelve hours a day are working.
But I have no prejudice to France.
What I see is a company that produces good agricultural pneumatics, has good equipment, is well-away and has spaces to increase.
Why does Titan need this company so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this company.
But with a proper price and competent workers, it is worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the company, Goodyear had offered the salaries a good recompense, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine Titan bought Goodyear the closed machine.
Thus, Titan could dismiss machines to Poland or to any other country of the European Union which still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amians' company with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan accepts to recruit them among the approximately 1 200 current salaries of Goodyear.
Moreover, Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan commitment before trying to bring CGT to the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear are concluding an agreement on the salaries for all employees.
So there will be no more employees in the company.
Mr Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he wants a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must agree on outcome refunds.
If all payers accept them, the purchase project of the company starts with zero employed.
How can we give employment guarantees when there are no longer employees on the site?
If Mr Montebourg arrives to agree with the CGT and Goodyear and Titan buys the machine, we have the intention of staying in Amiens-North over four years.
The benefit of Bombardier below, while delivery and aircraft orders are recovered
Bombardier Inc, a aircraft and a Canadian railway manufacturer, reported a 15% of its net benefit Thursday, under the pressure of decreasing orders and air supply during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based on Montreal, has not provided any flight test data for its new CSeries plane or information that allows to know whether the airplane will respect its ambitious commercial service calendar before September.
After the in-ural flight of the test plane, about a month and a half ago, the last stole only three times, and the question was asked if the test phase was in the right way.
The results were not at the height of the previsions and the course of action was 8% at the Toronto Bourse.
Cameron Doerksen, analyzed in the National Financial Bank, decreased its notation on Thursday, with "surformation" to "sector performance" due to the low potential of raising the bourgeois during the next quarter or the next two quarters.
"Although the decrease of air supplys has been largely predicted, we are really disappointed by the beneficial margin in the Transport Division," Cameron Doerksen said in a customer note.
We think Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft and as long as the flight test programme will progress.
However, if there is no new order for the next months, we expect that the market becomes more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries airport family will be able to catapulate it in the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first trial plane was released in March and was enveloped for the first time in September after the late months.
But the number of closed orders for CSeries aircrafts is modest until now at the height of 177. It is expected that potential buyers expect the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims on energy efficiency and the potential of the new online aircraft economy.
Currently, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and bought commitments to 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, president and leader of the direction, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 closed orders before the first aircraft's commercial service.
The leaders also assured the analystes and the media on Thursday indicating that the programme was progressing to the calend.
"The test plane has not remained at the ground longer than intended," said Mr Beaudoin during a telephone conference, which implies that the ground tests and software updates were planned during the time of the aircraft's stop.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and to provide a period of update, and that is what we did.

Repeat: a Member requests Brigitte Grouwels' demission
The draft minister Brigitte Grønels of "relifting" of the signal fire feet in Brussels does not like everyone.
For a reminder, the Brussels Ministry of Public Works and Transports launched this Thursday in the center of Brussels a test project consisting of repealing 16 flavors of the region's signaling to yellow and blue colours in Brussels.
The goal is both "enhanced security" and "Brusselless identity".
The idea is, at the end, to repeat all Brussels signaling fires for a estimated cost of approximately one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the Minister is "tropped", Mr Emmanuel De Bock Bruxelous, who speaks of "flaming" of the capital and requires Brigitte Grønels' "demission".
"Don't pleasing to expense the money of the Brussels in relief operations of the puzzle signaling pools to the colors of the Brussels region, Brigitte Grønels continues its flaminging operations of the Capitale," Mr. De Bock inquired in an appealed.
Following its yellow-manga-taxis, she finally repeated herself in black-blu-shirt-sweet Brussels pools.
According to the Member, there is now no "more difference of visual continuity between Flandre and Brussels".
The Brussels deserves better than seeing their money covered by a CD&V minister who self implements the NVA programme.
It's a big time to stop the horse of Troy de la Flandre.
"To remind, Brigitte Grouwels was chosen only with 2 245 voices or 0.5% of Brussels!", concluded Mr. De Bock.

Five years ago, my father was removed from the world of lives.
At the beginning I denied his death, I talked about him now,
I was so afraid to forget it, or I didn't know how I would continue to "frequently".
There is no reception, no employment mode to pass the wall of the ink and find its.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was conducting.
Another time, a mild wake up in full night to watch his watch that doesn't leave me anymore, put on the night table.
It's the picture of my smileful father who joins me in my gestures on the day.
Our mother left us after his fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought on the day I found his empty body, crished on this hospital bed to frozen draps.
Similarly, its funerals were a focused icelandic advantage around the lamp of the sandals that would cover its circle.
I thought she was gone.
Soon, by small daily or nightly apparitions, a little tired, a little disappeared, she quickly returned to my mind, evoluting to the fur and as she replaced her place in the landing of my thinking that believed in pain.
And then she revealed everything by dealing with my own faces that I had not yet imagined, hidden by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understanded that I had nothing lost the person of my mother, but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarnated this person during her life.
When she walked, she had perfectly his life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and whole.
This distance from my life's way remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I'm not saying to my father, "inside as outside" he seems.
They always told me.
I never believed it at that time.
I had difficult relationships with him until he became old, sick.
There, I didn't fear him anymore and I could love him.
One day, he died.
Penn't long, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was sick...
He was talking to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at my hands, preparing my body for him.
But it was never indiscret.
I could have a personal life.
He left me my intimacy.
It's been a long time and one day he's gone.
Finally, it was comfortable and comforting to be understanded, encouraged, advised.
I don't know anymore who said that the dead are not forgotten but inevitable.
My parents are no longer, but I always feel them near me.
Every event, every instinct of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they say? what would they think? what would they do?
I dream constantly of them, perhaps not every night, but several times a week it's sure.
I am often dreaming of the last instants I have to share with them before it's too late, only there's always something that prevents me from fulfilling this moment.
I am often worried when it comes to me, and I feel deeply their absent.
Some dreams bring me the contrary and enter my story, and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
The guard of my echography, where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was getting out of bed, my father was taking me on the pair, and he laughed and rejoiced I was waiting for a little boy.
On the next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he shared with joy what would have me.
And, of course, it was a little boy in my neck.
I liked to share this time with him, and I'm pleased to tell this common memory v. after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother died from a cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That's the shock that his disappearance caused by the young bachelor I was at the time.
I nevertheless made my hurt quickly enough.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I am in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
To learn the Arabic and to interest me in the Middle East, in order to make a master in a large school, there were no anodines choices with the recycling.
In fact, I often talked to her Arabic in my childhood, and talked about Marokko, where she had vo for decades - before she reacted to France at the time of independence.
The values she inculcated to me are always present, so I can think of how she would want me to act at a given time.
It's the same for my attitudes: I'm trying to be at the height of the generosity and the rightness of the one who was a believer.
Now, I feel it as a daily presentation, a well-being, a salvation spirit.
I see his eyes put on me.
My mother's dead nine years ago.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I have passed through all phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, weeping, weeping alone, anywhere, in insolite places, incongruent moments.
Then the time was deceived.
It was only the missing, this empty without answer, that need of her, to trust me, to assure me of her docler's grave.
Yet, she's here, silent presence, she's there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his anxious eyes put on me, I see the circles that surround his look, the ridles around the lips that burst the cigarettes, the most that mark the front of the days of concern.
My mother took my face and she looked at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I'll turn my eyes off.
My wife and mother of my three children are killed by a 43-year cancer.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise about his pain bed, then we had little to little reap to smile, and to pronounce his name is no longer tabo, but a comfort.
Of course, I'm talking to her in the grave of the night when the absent is too bad, she invites himself to my dreams when the moral is a little reached.
We feel weared and protected in difficult times, the rest of time makes us realize how much she was the leader of orchestra and we are trying to stay in the way she traced us.
If a person loved you very strong, the absent can't break it from your heart and memories.
In a certain way, lovedness becomes your internal energy.
I lost my father on 22 to 2008 from a cancer of amiant.
I was very close to him, I always acted depending on what he thought or what he appreciated.
I couldn't attend his inhumanation and three weeks after his death, I was born to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from her, I always wonder if my actions are in accordance with his vision of things.
Moreover, I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in a contrary sense, I don't sleep it, and I'm always asking what he's going to think about.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is this genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a little like a alter-ego, it didn't have to talk to us.
Shortly, he's here at the day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
This was soon 30 years when my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was six years old.
The big penalty that took me then was sure, but he's still close to me.
Very often he "search" in my dreams in such a way that is vital as when I wake up, I'm still more sad to find that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I'd go well, I said no, he answered me "I'm down" but with a very real voice that I was wake up in surprise, anxious, and I stuck the hair lamp, looking around, convinced that he would come.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel noticed and I get back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all rooms, I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I wouldn't leave this house where we were happy and his spirit lives with me.
I've been 58 years old, I've always been alone since he's gone, he's and will stay my life's love.
I'm going to say that I'm sociable with a responsibility officer, I'm laughing and sing, I'm out, I'm grandmother, I'm full of friends, but my heart and my heart belong to him, and I'm never talking about him except with my son, and I'm never going to the cimeter.
Iraq: October has been the most bloody month since 2008
October, Iraq was the most dead month since April 2008.
Bagdad held this Friday official numbers: 964 people lost life last month: 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day when the Iraq Prime Minister is received by the American President.
Noury al-Maliki wants aid from the United States.
"We don't say to the world to be with us and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said on Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what happens in Iraq is not resolved, it will be spread out, and what happens will be spread too.
And what happens when a terrorism virus lives?
Noury al-Maliki was expressed at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by the Congress.
Outside of the building, manifestants protested against the Iraqian leader.
They branded pancarts that accused him, among other things, of being a death and calling the United States to give him aid.
The cocain lawyer who informed a drug survey of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information to the Master of the crime Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer feared that his secret addiction to drugs would not be revealed at the great day.
He was sentenced to a three-year prison penalty by the Court of Assessment of Liverpool
A large defence lawyer, who had informed a report of drugs of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret addiction to drug was not revealed, was condemned to three years of prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, provided sensitive information to the Master of the crime Neil Scarbrough on investigations on drug trafficking activities after complaints because of its habit of consumption of cocaine.
The lawyer, who was called "Bash" and considered as a "primary dossier", was arrested by him in 2011 after the police's hearing operations to Scarborough, which he had represented in a process in relation to drug traffic.
Police officers discovered Sarborough, 32 years old, putting three cocaine sacs at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Laabbasire, while he attended a dinner of Barreau with conferences.
The investigations showed that Ditta was a regular consumer of this class A drug after tests showed cocaine traces in its hair, on its portfolio and credit cards.
In a period of eight months between January and 2011, he searched illegally for information on the arrest of two men for the Scarborough account and one of its associates.
The four suspicioners were at the time monitored by the police in the framework of a major investigation on a heroin and cocaine trading in the coasts of Laâashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were then imprisoned after the police took heroin and cocaine for a amount of 1.5 million pounds and more than 200 000 pounds in speeds during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to the stakeholders because he feared that its toxicity would not be discovered at the great day.
Today, at the Court of Assessments of Liverpool, Ditta, who works in the Lawyers Forbes' Cabinet in Blackburn, has been disgraced after being recognized due to two guilty officers of justice after a trial of three weeks.
He had admitted the ownership of cocaine during an audience.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police, seeking on Scarborough, discovered that he had been regularly in telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspicion and found it coming to the home of Ditta and placed drugs, clean to 60%, under the lawyer's pubs in a black golf ball.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at Ewood Park foot stage, in the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned to him, covered the drug, and they phoned nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a regular cocaine consumer after tests showed tracks of this class A drug in its hair, on its portfolio and credit cards.
Ditta was stopped later but refused to consume cocaine, and he said he had spoken to the drug trafficker prejudiced because he was his client and was worth that their discussions were subject to a “local privilege”.
During his arrest, Ditta collected her portfolio and tried to retrieve several credit cards, but they were all taken and a hair sample was taken to him.
In a questionnaire, he stated that he had a office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that he came to be called by customers with him for legal issues.
However, the court heard witnesses which he called major agents in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were at the time.
Prosecutor Anne Howte said: "If someone should know that it is not to violate the law, it is a penalty lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a penalty lawyer and to have been too involved in private customers.
The relationship we speak is not just a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker that provides drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of its communications will certainly be the most ambiguous communications because it was his lawyer.
But this has gone well beyond the limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He prevented the police's investigation as far as he had been able to allow him to continue its activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor her profession, but deceived her.
He was too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he allowed to compromise his independence.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I was not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited for 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the audience, the superintendent Lee Halstead of the Police of Laashire said: "Mr. Ditta has passed by a criminal lawyer to himself since he has started to provide drugs with organizations."
Its addiction to cocaine has always compromised it and has made it vulnerable to the members of the organizational groups who have loaded it of valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the most strict integrity rules and establish a confidence climate in the public.
Mr. Ditta delivered this confidence and tried to open himself behind his profession.
The unit charged by the serious and organized criminality of Laashire led the investigation on Mr. Ditta, which was recognized to be guilty of the three cocaine accusation officers and now through justice, demonstrating its commitment to pursue the justice.
Let this case serve as a warning to the whites so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you before the courts.
Scarborough himself has been captured for 14 years after he has caused the fault of heroin, cocaine and cannabis traffic complexity.
Thirty-five other persons involved in traffic were condemned to a total of 153 years of prison for drug trafficking.
On its site, Ditta organized a meeting of questions/responses on himself during which he said that his dream job would be a lawyer to represent customers in the rock of death in America, his last invited to dinner would be Mohammed Ali, and inequality would motivate him to work.

New request for collective complaints against the brothers Sainte-Croix
A new request for collective complaints was submitted against the brothers of Sainte-Croix, regarding sexual agressions that would be held this time in the Saint-Joseph oral, as well as in several orphans, orphans and schools.
The request is supported by the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J", which would have been masturbed in the 1950s, by his teacher the Brother Submitted, and then by his confessor, the father Bernard, in the Saint-Joseph speaker, where he was served as messe and where his father worked as a painting.
The first resource was only three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people said to us, "I, I was in such a place, could I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both resources.
The collective complaint that has just been deposited is particularly allowed by complaints of any institution where seeds could have been perpetuated by members of the congregation of Saint-Croix.
Currently, the complaint gathers complaints of 25 people who claim to have been aggressed by the brothers of Sainte-Croix.
Allocated facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first recurso, since many of the institutions mentioned have closed their doors in the 1960s.
The complaint also emphasizes that the congregation of Saint-Croix and the speaker of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "too allow sexual relations to children," that they "exerted moral, religious and psychological constraints on the victims", that they were "to the core of perpetrated sexual seeds and, however, too, too, and that they have "sciently and consciously chosen to ignore the problem".
These latters are based on letters published by the Lawyer of Sainte-Croix, Me Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also by research in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, an ancient brother of Sainte-Croix, who expressed the seas.
The collective complaint must be awarded by the stage of receipt in the Supreme Court.
Once the receiptability approved by the Court is processed at the second stage, whether auditions on the basis.
In the case of the first complaint, the congregation of Saint-Croix had accepted to regulate friendship before auditions were conducted on the base.

Many opposition to medical assistance to be held in the Paliative care Congress
The Canadian Congress of Palatiative Care, which is held this week in Ottawa, occurs a few days after the vote for the principle of the Medical Aid Project in Quebec.
This is the opportunity for several palliative careers to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all sick people had access to effective care to pass their sufffrances, in addition to be able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, a port-word of the Canadian Association of Paliative care, Maryse Bouvette.
If we focused on paliative care in Canada, the approach to Euthana would be minimum.
The Chairman of the Quebec Palative Care Network also rejects the draft medical assistance law.
If adopted, Albert Dery is concerned about the consequences of the next generations.
"What is the sense of life," she deployed.
Most palatiative care houses will help patients to help, the president of the Palative House Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Mrs. Fitzback, also guided by the home Mathieu-Froment-S in Gatineau, believes that the service would be inutile in any way.
We never ask, "I want to give me a injection."

He doesn't think Ontario's going to buy it.
On its hand, the Liberal Deputy of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, states that the idea of the end of life should be clarified before the draft law is adopted.
The Kenyan press covered the controversy law on media
"It's a fearing country and it's urgent to ask: what will prevent Parliament from dealing with the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?", said the journal, contesting the draft law and asking the inconstitutional statement.
"This law is draconous and very punishable, and we do it," explained Cyrus Kamau, Director-General of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of the most independent stations and web sites in Kenya.
He noted that the new court of media “will always be partial because it is a prolongation of the government” and that the restrictions on content and publicity would be harmful in the place of Kenya in the world economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this draft law and to send it back before the parliamentary," he said.
According to the journal The Star, the new law project will allow the government to have "the maintenance on media". The Standard a indicates that the democracy and the freedom of opinion in Kenya had "committed a hard coup" and forshes the dracon project.
The adoption of the draft law involves at the same time a train of measures to strengthen national security in the silence of the attack perpetuated by armed islamists in the Westgate trade center in September.
The Canadian media have raised the wrath of the authorities by spreading pictures of video monitoring cameras on which the groups exploded on the scene of the attack were self-disputed by the trade center of luxe.
The police leader, David Kimiyo, reacted by calling two journalists and a media responsibility to interview them, although the convocation has been revoked after a mixture in the media.
In accordance with the new law project, media can be paused by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists with the additional risk of being "radiated" or not more able to receive official press acreditation.
The Court also has the power to take the goods of an opposite if he did not pay his adoption.
According to Daily Nation, “a single amen suffices to paralyze most of the FM stations. ”
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the "animated blogosphere" of Kenya.
By reducing the media to silence, political men know that they can do what they want in any sense.
"No one will never be," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist in The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in life.
"The political men would make the country in deficiency and bring us back to jail and cake."
The Kenya Islators were the goal of the people's anger in the past.
In May, they took position against the coups ordered by the National Commission for Salaries and restored their mirrobolic salaries of approximately 532 000 shillings per months of tax exemption – which are among the highest worldwide.

However, the CSSS decided not to engage in independent work, which may cost up to three times more dear than a full-time farmer.
We haven't had a deal, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities have been analyzed or reduced inside the palier facilities, as long as things are replaced.
Of course we have worked hard to interest our young people [residents in pharmacists] so they come and stay here.
There was a concurrence of circumstances that caused us to be in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this heated period, 2013-2014, the CSSS pharmaceutical department is just easier.
Three pharmacists have already returned to work after their maternity and three other pharmacists have been emballed in the past months.
Furthermore, the efforts made by the Department to maintain have brought fruit, since the four currently residents in Laval also decided to remain at the employment of the CSSS.
Now it's much better, the pharmacist has highlighted.
From here the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three returns of maternity.
This will therefore complete our departments of the past year.
Always growing
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as hospital pharmacists or a predomination of young women in the office, make situations such as v in 2012 difficult to be predicted.
For us [the number of efficiencies] is always preserved, because we have a young environment and we use many young women, so with pregnant women, we are almost always rolling at three congestions of maternity when it's fine, she's .
Last year, we had much more and no pharmacists available to replace, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model doesn't start his career at the film by the small door.
The Lars von Trier realizer chose to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next movie.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will go out in two areas (the 1st and 8 January 2014), is the erotic memories of a accro-sex-quarters since its adolescence.
The similarity of Stacy Martin with her older woman is a brindille silhouette, a diaphanic tint and French origins.
Without forgetting a certain go of risk: the one who had not been worried to put naked on ice paper will be shown in much more sulfurous situations on the large ́ran.
An extrait from Nymphomaniac made the temperature up on the Toilet: Stacy Martin appears in the bed and in full extase with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provoking cineast requested his actors to put their potential on the platelet, he had access to X's professionals for the most osed sex scenes, before all the bodies were digitally merged: above the cinture, it was the star; below, the duplicate.
From Bürk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, by Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has the habit of putting his shareholders in their last delays, always for the best.
Stacy Martin didn't finish talking about her.
A Evacuated CGR CG of Narbonne Thursday evening
Thursday evening, the first meeting of a movie was interrupted in the Mega CGR of Narbonne, with caution, following the pick-ups of the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the establishment made the evacuation of the room and warned the pumpers for a suspicious smoke.
Some 70 people went out of the meeting.
People have been examined and a complete employment of the room has not been given anything.
Wrong plaster on the bottom of lacrymogene?
Or an involuntary incident?
It is always that the movie direction has played the principle of caution and security of its clients.
The room was appealed and everything went back in order.
The film was able to recover his rights and the customers to find it pleasing images.
They'll just be on it.
It is trying to import 2 kg of cocaine into citrus
Professor of Halloween's day, a woman tried to enter the country two kilograms of cocaine dissimulated in citrus, Thursday morning, at the Montréal-Trudeau airport.
This is during the review of the passenger baggage that drugs could have been detected.
Cocaine was distributed in three citros previously empty.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Gendarmery office of Canada (GRC) who took the rest in this investigation.
Canadian Border Services Agency (ASFC) did not discover where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, Jacqueline Roby, ASFC password.
What I can tell you is that she came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services at the Montreal-Trudeau airport have made 173 drugs, including 10 cocaine inputs for a total of 44 kg.
In 2012, the frontier services officers of the Quebec region carried out a total of 1653 drugs.
Air Raid against military facilities
According to the Libyan Army, Israeli aircraft entered the Lebanese airspace on Monday afternoon, but the battery had occurred at the evening.
A short air air load of SA-8 would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of Tsahal's aircraft in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or by the Year.
The raid was developed in nearly identical circumstances to those who had occurred on 5 July: at that time, it was also an anonymous American responsible who had confirmed the CNN a Israeli attack, this time regarding the Yakhont southern missiles, delivered by Russia to.
Israeli responsibles did not hide their irritation to see Washington to reveal the attack, for the risk of prohibiting President Assad to respond.
Ukraine approaches the failure
The Standard & Poor's Rating Agency has decreased the Ukrainian solvency note on Friday, doubting the capacity of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than one year, to address its financial obligations.
The note of the country's debt titles is "B-", based on the category of special investment.
It is a negative perspective, S&P, seeing at least one chance of three to be rebuilt from this year.
"It is less than the government's strategy allows to ensure sufficient foreign awards to meet its high external financing needs," explains the American Agency.
The Agency points out that Ukraine's change reservations have fallen from 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and provides that the trend will continue.
This complies with the recovery of the loans taken to the foreign.
These reserves, to which the authorities have been massively responsible for supporting the local currency, the hryvnia, which is deploying, the Agency considers more evaluation, which would be decreasing its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to resolve its imports of gas to Russia, which charges that he has not paid a $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of living pressures with its Russian neighbor, angry of Kiev's will to sign an agreement with the EU end of November.
It was reported on the next day of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had passed between July and September after its fifth quarter after contract.
Its endlessness, yet relatively modesty, has exploited in recent years and S&P estimated 33.5% of the BDP, against less than 10% before the crisis in 2008-2009.
The country, in budget deficit, has been charged for months by the International Monetary Fund, which has granted him a 15.3 billion dollars in 2010 and has discontinued it for only 3.4 billion.
However, the Fund will pay any new tranche until the country has adopted immunication reforms to reduce its deficit, in particular by increased gas prices to the population.
Following a new infructuous mission in the country, the FMI found that this week "the important needs of external financing" constituted "complearability", while "the signs of economic improvement".
However, for the economicist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre of Political Study, "only a short-term improvement can be expected."
"There is a little hope that immoral reforms will be held in a pre-electional year," as the presidential elections were planned in 2015, the expert, asked to the AFP.
The only hope is a improvement of the international conjoy.
The S&P also refers to the "incertainty" related to the possible signing of an agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions to release the opposite Joulia Timochenko.
"The signing of the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but there could be a short and medium-term negative consequences related to Russia's reaction," explained S&P, fearing "comercial restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, representing the fourth of the Ukrainian exports, warned that in the case of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its controls at the border for imported goods.
Green Fire of the United States at the Publicis-Omnicom Fusion
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they had no objection from the American authorities to their merger, thus reflecting the creation of the first world publicity agency.
Fusion is actually approached by the second World Agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group have announced today the expiration of the time limit for the summary review of the publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as you have been sent," they announce the two groups in one.
They indicate that they also received the required authorisations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the period of examination laid down by the HSR in the United States and the decisions of Implementation issued in other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the implementation of the operation.
"The combination is also conditioned to obtain other regulatory authorisations and to approve the shareholders of the two groups," they say.
The Congolese Army throws the M23 rebels
The Congolian Army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units were going to throw the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of the North Kivu border of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the point of being taken from the localities of the North-East Republic of the Congo (RDC) that he was controlled from the beginning 20 months ago from the insurrection.
"We're going to purchase the M23 and accumulate it where it is hidden because it's `s `s'", said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, port-word of the FARDC.
We do not have to let them go back because they have martyrized the Congolian people for a long time.
It's time to bring peace back.
M23's responsibles explained that they have evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and that Bertrand Bissimwa, a political responsible for the rebellion, claimed on the RFI that these military turns would not have any revenge to peace speakers.
The latest, Uganda mediators, returned on Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and M23.
Acrochases are reported in the rubbers dominant Bunagana, the last locality in the hands of the insects to be fallen this week, and around the ↑ioni, a mountain where M23 rebellion saw the day in 2012.
At their appointment in November, the insects occupied Goma, head of the province of Northern Kivu, who benefited from the fleeting of the government garnison and the viability of the blue cacks of Monusco.
Goma's fall brought the United Nations Mission in the RDC, the most important world in terms of efficiency, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade combined by South African, Malawi and Tanzanian soldiers.
On its hand, the major state of the FARDC has been refunded and the army has passed to the opponent against M23 and has changed the war course.
The progress of government troops is currently unfair.
"The M23 to touch its end," announced a congolian business expert, Jason Stearns, on his Congo Siasa blog.
It would be historical - it would be the first time the government of Kinshasa succeeded to make a major insurrection.
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group associated with Rwanda would be present in the east of the RDC.
Experts of the United Nations accusate Rwanda, who refused to support M23 militaryly, constituted in the department of Mutinated Congolian military elders.
The leader of the British diplomacy, William Hague, invited the Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show a detention, announced a port-word of the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had noted the possibility of military repressions after obses fallen in the Rwandan territory.
Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invade the streets of the bourgade to salute the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
"We have v° a year with the M23 and we seemed unimaginable to be released by the army," testifies a resident of the Uganda frontier locality.
"We have v ́ in the terror (M23), we are traumatised," said this man.
The tests performed by the Pastor Institute on a patient suspected to be infected by the coronavirus were negative, announced the Ministry of Health.
It states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 are therefore the only two cases confirmed in France today."
March, this 43-year-old patient was suspicious of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already made a 50-year-old.
Chevron, the second American petrol company, stated on Friday a decrease in its trimestrial benefit due to the decreasing of its raffination margins, while its oil and gas production has grown still in comparison with the targets of the group.
Its net benefit from the third quarter decreased by $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per action, against $5.25 billion, or $ 69 per action, one year ago.
Analysis asked by Re·s are in average on a share of $2,71.
The group produced 2.59 million oil equivalent bars per day during the trimester, increased by 2.52 million bpj produced one year ago.
The company aims at 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a growth of 25% of the expected production since 2017.
The major part of growth in the future years will come from its natural gas projects liquor.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditure increased by seven billion dollars in two years and should reach 36.7 billion dollars in 2013.
The benefits of production activities have been decreased to the third quarter, while the benefits of the downstream activities (to raffination and chemical production) have fallen from 45% to 380 million dollars.
This decrease in the raffination margins affects the sector.
Thus, the main competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil stated Thursday of a lower net benefit, despite the increase of its gas and oil production.
Educational transport: the claim to be acceptable
The School Commission of the Region-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) requires from the beginning of the school year of $150 per family (to maximum $300 per family) for two residential school transport benefits, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do.
Before the changes made to the latest budget, no financial contribution was required.
"The Commission proposes a mediation service and I was interested," explains Mrs Lefèvre.
It states that the CSRS was invited to a mediation and requested a further time to consider it.
"It is always better to talk to it, to concert and to find solutions," Mrs Lefèvre states.
The School Commission of the Region of Sherbrooke (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization only signed that mediation was part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closing of the emergency of the Hotel-Dieu
In view of the branch conducted for several months by a part of the staff and several syndicates, including the CGT, the Minister for Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on 10 July to "decrease the calendar for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closing emergency that could not be intervened on 4 November".
A request officially made "not to risk the support of emergency in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also intended not to geneze the PS campaign at a few months of municipalities.
Despite ministerial consignments, closure should be effective at that date.
Although the APHP is preferred to use the term "transformation" or "continuity change".
Since 4 November, the pumpers who had a quarter of about 40,000 annual passports to the emergency of the Hotel-God will all receive to take the thirty serious cases daily to the emergency of other Paris hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of internates.
At the Hotel-God, the emergency internal sites will leave on Monday at five general doctors.
As regards the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the month's current.
"Hotel-Dieu's emergency receipt service must close within the shortest time, and for us, it's on 4 November," assures Loïc Capron, the President of the APHP Medical Committee (CME), which supports the draft direction.
"The 4 November there will be no more patients brought by the pumpers, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical responsibility of the new Hotel-God.
"But we will continue to receive patients in emergency," he says, "which makes the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on place to transfer serious cases.
Ancient emergency doctors will remain at the place, too, it will be assured.
But it's the ARS that it belongs to determine the closure of the emergency receipt service.
"The things are going progressively," Nicolas Péju, a portfolio of the ARS for which, on 4 November, "no changes will be made in terms of service."
"The Minister has lied to us or we have lied to him," deployed the urgent doctor Gérald Kierzek.
From its head post of the SMUR beginning of July in order to have led the band against the reorganization project, it is defined as a "alert launcher" against a "chinical" decision taken by "the Medical-administrative Technology".
"They are being emptying and asphyxing emergencys that have been renewed less than five years ago," he considers.
For him, "if the other Paris emergency services would absorb the overall, there would be no problem."
Or they are regularly bound.
For example, there are at times nine hours of waiting for Lariboisière's emergency.
In the ARS, it is stated that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not able to represent a "balance" in other emergency services, whereas human means will be strengthened otherwise.
In the ARS as well as in the APHP, the "new hospital model" is already on the road since 7 October, which should continue to receive 30.000 to 35.000 patients per year.
From here to the end of the year, liberal generalists should also participate in the establishment of a "permanent ambulance care".
"Where are we going if people ask themselves to diagnose," Gérald Kierzek asks who "the concept of no serious emergency" is "periodic" and marks a "medical regression".
This will happen as for level 3.
People are not crazy, they're going to go where there's the best care offer.
If the Minister doesn't measure this Monday, we'll change brackets, Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We will be more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider to present a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, adviser of Paris, and chosen from the fourth rounding, announced that "although the Paris UMP was for the maintenance of emergency at the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to re-open them if they return to the responsibility".
Anne Hidalgo, PS candidate, reminded her again on Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken for a moratory so that there was no closer on 4 November.
If that was the case, she would mark her net disappointment, Bruno Ju ́ard, her password.
Although the Revolution of the Hotel-God has its initiative on the ground, we cannot accept it without a acceptable scheme of reporting to other hospitals.
Obama ends listening to the FMI and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end the hearings she practiced on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the framework of its information activities, indicating a American responsible on Thursday.
This decision is part of the attempt of the White House to resume the hand in the NSA hearings case after the revelations made by ancient analytical Edward Snowden, repeated in Russia.
This is the first time IMI and the World Bank's monitoring has been mentioned by the Information Agency since the beginning of the scandal.
A responsible for the US administration answered: "The United States do not carry out electronic monitoring with regard to the seats of the World Bank and FMI in Washington."
In terms of anonymity, this responsibility did not indicate whether such a monitoring had been carried out by the past.
Another official indicated that Barack Obama had ordered to stop these practices during last weeks.
This instruction was given almost at the same time as that ending the hearings of the University General in New York.
In this context, the Senatory Information Committee approved Thursday a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes, but authorised their follow-up.
The Committee established new restrictions on data authorised by the information agencies to collect and imposed a five-year limit for the conservation of these information.
United Nations welcomes the new objectives for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new series of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (WHO), which have been set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
The Australian diplomats played a key role in the implementation of "durational development goals" to replace WTOs, which will expire in 2015 before the United Nations Supreme on Sustainable Development, which began the guard in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final project of the document, which will be adopted by the world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the top.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon said to the survey of the top that he was now time to "over the national interests".
"I am glad that the Member States have accepted the launch and accept the process to set universal sustainable development objectives (ODD)," he said.
These ODDs will be based on the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be integrated in the development framework after 2015.
I will make the maximum of the mandate I have been granted by Member States to achieve our view of sustainable development goals based on the success of WTOs.
Anxiety related to security in Mozambique grows at the same time as conflicts arising between powerful personalities
At the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, tossing them, thousands of people gathered themselves in the centre of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans in a rare manifestation.
"We want peace to return; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, general guide for a investment company.
Anxiety for the future of her country, she changed her work clothes against a tea-shirt that mentioned "We want security" in Portuguese before the massed crowd arrived on the place of the Independence of the Capital of Thursday.
Due weeks ago, there were almost every day of reports that have been conflicting between government forces and Renamo, the worst crossings since the peace agreement signed over 20 years ago.
Renamo was sometimes a famous rebel movement, supported by Rhodesia, and then the Government of South Africa's apartment in the context of efforts to destabilise the independent government of the country.
According to a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not return to an open conflict, but recent events have cut out foreign investors and local population.
The impact is significant for the full growth economy because the covering of large offshore gas reserves and carburants in the north-western could attach more than 50 Md$ investment during the next years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Brazil Valle, Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the party to the power and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo has mutually rejected the responsibility of pressure.
Renamo states that the Government is originating in recent conflicts and that he has launched an attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional basement of Renamo on 17 October.
The attacks on ancient rebellion were then degenerated when the government forces attacked the foundations of Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo's portfolio, the Financial Times.
The Government makes Renamo responsible for the conflicts and the accusation of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza stated Wednesday to the AFP, the French press agency, that Mr Dhlakama was viewed as a "per". He wanted to use "all the forces he remained to try to prove that he could make his decisions to the Government."
The Frelimo and Renamo insist in saying that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew up after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo had abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He said to the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
“ We want to renew negotiations, but with the greatest serious, ” said Mr. Mazanga.
The discussions between the parties have not been able to deal with the pressures feeded by a series of conflicts this year.
"There are two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop disturbing themselves," explained Joseph Hanlon, a conference at the open and specialist university of Mozambique.
No one of them can well negotiate and no one of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, has already said that she would boycotter the municipal elections to take place in November.
The presidential and islative elections shall be scheduled in the next year.
Some commentators interpreted its use of force as the attempt to a sick movement of concesions and a war treasure from the government.
The part of the suspects has been collected by Renamo since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) created by an old member of the Renamo should have a greater number of elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza, who should return to the end of his second mandate next year, would want to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multipartal democracy, he does not want transparency elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mr. Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but she has led light attacks on police commissioners and vehicles on a northern-south autoroute axis.
The majority of acrochases occurred in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred miles north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which Mineral companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export carbon.
In June, Rio couldn't use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was fairly tired when he was asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique, ” said Mr. Mazanga.
Instability has strengthened the frustrations raised by the Government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, a independent media society, and many are also concerned about corruption, development slowness and recent relief vague.
"The people think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country, and that it is the last to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a manifestant, said that people wanted only stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads," he said.
Myths and mythes should be taught to children as “the models of life, ” says the author.
Thor's Legend may show that "the brutal force does not weigh the weight of the subtil rose", while the Arthurian ends reveal the importance of having a dream.
As many myths would be "too violent, too scandalous and in some cases, too obscene to be learned at the earlier," Crossley-Holland predicted a "minute selection" of works adapted to the age.
"I find amazing that in America, myths and peoplelors are already part of education," he said.
I have been in favour of this project for 20 years.
He said that the fact that the authors and teachers are "openly teachers" is that children are "completely decreasing, and the messages are "sublimized" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the anglo-saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British People Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you will prefer them to keep out of view."
Perhaps the great difference between a adult writer and a adult writer for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or finished well, but there is an inner sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublime; revealed through a story rather than said.
The basis is known of what we show and that we don't say.
A warrior of the Army of Hamas was killed tonight and another wounded by a Israeli carrying in the Gaza band, learned from medical and safe sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists conducted a supervisory operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they carried out an obesity of a blind Israelite.
NSA spionage: the United States are "too far", admits Kerry
The United States sometimes went "trother far" in the field of spinner, recognized the state secretary John Kerry, in this first February of Washington in full polemic with Europe on the massive data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denunciations between the United States and their European Allieds, the first time a US governmental responsibility admits explicitly the practices in the interception of the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I convince you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this will no longer happen in the future," John Kerry said at a conference in London to which he participated since Tuesday 31 October by video connection since Washington.
In his re-transmission, in the presence of his British approved William Hague, the leader of the American diplomacy has long-termly justified the practices of information and collection of information by the necessary anti-terrorist fight and the prevention of potential attacks.
By calling on the attacks of 11 September 2001, Madrid's attacks in March 2004 and London's attacks in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the United States authorities had already enjoyed many expectations projects through the interception of communications and information collection.
"We have actually prevented that aircraft fall, that immobile explode and that people be disabled, because we were able to be able to run over these projects," said the American diplomacy pattern.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process of innocent people have not been wronged."
But we strive to raise information.
"And, in some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately," admitted the State Secretary, who had already had to express himself on this international scandale during a turn last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday evening that President Obama was "determined to try to clarify and that he had a review of these practices so that no one might feel wrong."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to disturb this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, NSA intercepted hundreds of million Google and Yahoo users.
The journal, quoting documents obtained by the former consultant of NSA Edward Snowden, states that the baptism program "MUSCULAR" and conducted with the British Homologe of the NSA, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibres used by internet genders.
As one of the documents believed, about 181 million elements were collected in the last month of January - with metadatins on emails, text items or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied all the connections with these practices.
Since ten days, several large newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have shown that the NSA would have massively intercepted data and communications from the United States and their leaders, including the German chancelary Angela Merkel.
In view of the wrath of the European States and when fugitives in the American press claimed that the American president was not in the court of such hearings, Barack Obama had expressed it, calling on national security.
Nevertheless, the powerful NSA patron, general Keith Alexander, denied him that his information agency had captured tens of millions of European citizens' communications.
He even returned the ball to European information services that would be taken from these communications before delivering them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where the Otan aliens cooperated with the United States and that would not absolutely show Europe, said General Alexander.
And the polymetic was on Friday in Asia.
Indonesia invited Australia's ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans in the framework of a wide international campaign network that also highlighted China's ira.
The Saint-German Paris will receive Lorient Friday without his master's accommodation, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is wounded, announces the Ligue 1 club in a covered.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco, spread the list of players held for this 12th day match, without the 32-year attack.
It simply indicates that it is "blead" without indicating the nature of the wound.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee when he returned to the selection at the beginning of months.
A ceremonie in memory of the crematised dead
The cremeatorium of Father Lachaise organizes at 11 hours a lake ceremonie, in memory of all the dead in his establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate to Paris's officer, must be assisted there, and then will explain its proposals on the funeral.
To follow the ceremonie, click above.
For their own obsequences, more than in France, they choose creaming rather than inhuming: 53%, a Ipsos study carried out on 6 and 7 September by 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For obsequences of nearby, it is the inverse: the French prefer inhumanation (53% against 47%).
If they have the difficulty to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose creaming.
In his book La Mort in censures, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and chairman of the National Ethic Committee of the Sepulture, insists on the "violence" which constitutes the creaming for the surroundings.
There is, with the creaming, "a violence made to the loved body", which will be "reduced to a degree of cendres" in very few times, not after a composition process, which would "compact the phases of pain".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which aims to "reduce singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of census.
Why is it still bad in France that is accepted unfortunately in some northern and protesting countries?
"Because the creaming is a new fact," answers Marie-Frederique Bacqué, President of the Nanatology Society and author of the book Approach death.
It has been tolerated only by the Catholic Church since 1963, which has limited the attempts to approve it.
Approaching the creaming is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director-General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the dead a ceremonie as worthy as to which he would have right with an inhumanation.
Ipsos' annual investigation shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremonie.
77% of the French want to be religious (53%) or civil (24%) for their neighbors.
Currently, percent of people who have chosen a creation want to organize a ceremonie.
66% of the athletes or not believers also want it.
Cremeatories have adapted to this society's development.
"For a decade of years, they strive to avoid family violence of a waiting, without doing anything, for a hour and a half, immediately following the censure release," notes Mr. Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now propose the masters of ceremonies, which, in the presence of the body, go to the following ritual: accept the assembly, name the dead, connect it to others, call it, give sense to his death, organize the dead.
This is the case of the Creatorium of Father Lachaise since 1998.
Ceremonie masters often are people who have restored themselves.
There are also ancient Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Creatorium of Father Lachaise has organized, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of memory, laic and non-religious, which he invites the families of those who have been credited in the year.
For the second conscious year, one of these ceremonies is transferred in line with the attention of those who could not be moved.
The crematorium allowed us to relax it.
In La Seyne, the relocation for rats turns to polymetic
At the beginning of the week, a family left his apartment in a re-bussed place of the Fructidor D2, due to the presence of rats.
Before the emergency of the situation, the Director of South Habitat's Agency proposed exceptionally and temporarily to repeat the couple and its three children in a new T4.
However, the family is "for financial reason" and the situation is blocked.
The case took exagered proportions, as Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
There's always been rats in the towns.
The degradation undertaking performs two passports per year, and in addition, we intervene at our load at each request of the residents.
So we have done 64 interventions since the end of the last winter.
The quarter isn't left to leave, and the rats don't pull in the city.
For reasons for the protection of the environment and health, degradation products are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats, a child will not be killed.
"We haven't invited the rats with us," defends the family father who left his apartment to install in the hotel.
We're soon without the bottom and we're waiting for a new apartment at the same tariff as the elder.

A house of flames in the Old Quebec
An incendie that started Thursday Wednesday in the Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than 30 pumps have been moved at the 9th street of Hebert.
Flames were declared in a house of three apartments divided on four stages behind the court of the Quebec Seminar.
All residents were inconsistent in the burning.
The fire was controlled a hour after the pumps' arived, which were many to intervene.
Soon as our first pumps arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.

An investigation is current to find the cause of this inflammation.
Ben Greenman : Tenth anniversary of New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York was the place where the standup was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the Vudeville actor Frank Fay, who had the role of a ceremonial master in the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell blacks directly before the public, on the ton of the conversation.
Fay's innovation was perpetuated over the years, until it was recently recovered by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club of Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 spectacles presented in small clubs and large theatres.
"The majority of the Office heads have gone to Carolines, and have experienced great success until they have become too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to continue working with them.
The event of this year will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of the "Start Up for Heroes", a commodity and music at the benefit of ancient fighters, organized in Madison Square Garden, which will be present, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival took the width, just as the world of the comedia.
Many of the commodities participating at the festival of this year have passed through non-traditional circuits, for example presenting spectacles on small television chains, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll showed his appearance on the front of the scene in a sicom on a cable chain ("The League" on the theme of the fantasy football theme with joy loscif of the FXX chain) and now has his own sches spectacle on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" emission and was part of the casting of the " Parks and Recreation" series, but it is even more known for its series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a single voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defensor of Racial Justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralised world of the American Comic.
One of the main factors of the festival attraction this year will be a entrepreneur: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as stand-up comedian, but he became a complete film and television performer, as well as an official historic of the comedia.
Since 2005 and 2007, he encouraged a TV emission that was called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held at the Hotel of City, in the centre of Manhattan.
"The city is permanently in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he came down a road between two immobiles and he said, well, if I lose my whole money, maybe I'd come to live here.
The oil price continues to decrease and approach $96 the baril
The oil price continued to be decreased on Friday while the concerns relating to the importance of stocks are a report showing that the Chinese Gurmand in Electability is being strengthened.
The American reference brute price for delivery in December was decreased by 14 cents to 96.24 dollars at the end of the morning in Europe in electronic exchanges on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 percent Thursday, with a decrease of 5.8 per cent for October.
The abundant oil offer has weighted the price during the last weeks.
The American Energy Department stated on Wednesday that American supply increased by 4.1 million barils last week.
In five weeks, supply increased more than 25 million bars.
However, two reports on the manufactured sector of China arrived Friday, which show the growth of the activity, suggest an increase in the application.
This suggests that the economic recovery of China could continue to be reaffirmed after the growth has increased by 7.8% to the third quarter, after a decrease that two decades were not known at the quarter.
The Brent brute, a reference to the international brute already used by the American raffiners, lost 26 cent to fall at $108,58 on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in London.
In the case of the right to abort in Texas
In Texas, a Federal Call Court repeated certain restrictions to the right to voluntary breakdown of pregnancy which had been locked by a court of first instance this week.
This judgment means that a law text adopted in July in that State and broadly repealing the right to abort will be able to enter into force.
The arrest made by the Call Court means that the doctors who will practice IVG will have a "privilege of admission" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, according to his status of a hospital member, to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical centre in order to release a ́c or a treatment.
IVA defensors appreciate that the contents of the law could be translated by an immediate closure of a third of the state clinics because these clinics did not succeed in → this "privilege of admission" for their practices.
In total, there would be approximately 22,000 women who would be private for access to these institutions.
On Monday, a first-institutional judge had considered the entry into force of the law that the provisions for the privilege of adoption were anticonstitutional.
But attorney General of Texas, the Greg Abbott Republic, who broke the Governor's post, asked the Court of Appeal to judge the first instance that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in force, the side of audiences, with 1.3 million televisors behind their television post, or 5.6% of the audience.
But was the spectacle at the meeting?
About 10 000 candidates presented the audiences of this 10th season to address the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the cause of André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, televisors shared their comments.
After the encouragement to find their favourite programme, many have been disappointed.
But why so disappointment?
No candidate has actually marked this first premium.
Like each year, the first audience emissions make a wide choice of threshold songs, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
And on Twitter, we want spectacle, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some found their account there.
They are many to have tried the New Star, and sometimes even to have gone to the end.
After television screens, the calls of successful song are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to laugh.
The Court blocks a decision on the control and foo policy of the NYPD
A Federal Call Court blocked Thursday the decision of a judge requesting amendments to the New York Police Department's control and foo-program and demanded the case.
The United States Call Court (Second Circle) said that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the outcome of the city's interrupted call.
The Court stated that the city had violated the Constitution after the implementation of its programme aimed at monitoring and interviewing citizens.
The city called out its conclusions and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to help the police department at its policy and the training programme associated with him.
The Call Court heard the arguments on the application of suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the court should be derogated from the case because it violated the Code of Conduct of Judges by impelling the need for a judge to avoid any aspect of partiality, partly due to a series of interviews granted to the media and statements in which it reacted to the critics of the Court.
The Court stated that the police officers violated the rights of decades of thousands of people by targeting black and spanish men in the framework of their programme of control and fo.
It designated an external controller to monitor changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test the cameras on the body in the quarters where the largest number of controls is carried out.
The city of New York accepted the end of the practice consisting of maintaining the names and addresses of persons who were rejected after a police control.
The audience of the call interviewed by the city should have occurred after 14 March 2014.
Many civil rights defensors have criticized the control and foo tactics.
This control and foo system exists since decades in a certain way, but the number of checks recorded in a spectacular way under the administration of the independent master Michael Bloomberg, to reach his highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls which were mainly related to black and spanish men.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all of minorities, and was transformed into collective action.
Participants in the NYPD control and fo-fo-programme say that they will end unfair practices, enable them to have more effective police forces and to trust them, and can change how police departments use the policy.
The opposers say that these changes would reduce the police's moral without decreasing criminality, represent a decrease of money, and would not solve the larger problem of police forces under pressure after the police's effectives have been highly reduced in the past decade.
The Court highlighted that it did not end the practices of control and fo-to-doing, which are constituent, but that it reformed the way NYPD implemented its controls.
Locations must go to vote, because each of them pay $100 per month on the price of the apartment that is going to be taxed to the town.
When the owner pays $5000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each apartment.
We are obligated to pay the loans to help us pay the new taxes.
By voting, we send a message.
We need to make things change in the town.
All candidates told us that they would attack the scandal debt.
We don't have the ways to pay art fires to $100, $4 to $5 million, in case...
Let's vote, that's the best way to express you and say that it's enough.
End of service for the cuisine head of Elisea
In the 500 m2 of the elixenian kitchens as made after working in ambassadors, the kitchen took all the levels until he became head, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents from Georges Pompidou in France in Holland by Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their holidays, and feeding an innumerable number of big people in this world in a nearly anonymity that he breaks only today at the 60-years of the travel.
The man with open face, degarni and intellectual lunches, born on October 24, 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, is owner of a CAP of pasture.
His mother was her own kitchen in a Sologne chat.
"I have passed from a castle the other!", Ironis Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the hands of the six presidents for whom he has officed, but also their wives and some of their guests.
"This is always the head of the State or his companion or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly in kitchen," as she had prohibited women in the kitchens of Elizabeth!
It does not move to State leaders who showed a relative indifference to earthly food, " they are all gourmands," Bernard Vaussion declares gently.
Jacques Chirac had certain "a little more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the dairy, the residents returned empty!
As regards François Holland, who repayed the brass, "It's someone who loves eating" and "It's not a great thing that he doesn't love."
The current Chairman of the State, who has recovered the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has "no specific scheme request".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that was weakened on his shoes, especially at the state dinners in Elizabeth: it is necessary to use " between 200 and 250 people at an hour".
The next night is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there were errors.
Now the old chief of the kitchens of Elisea, who took a glass Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, walking with a pince in the heart."François Holland came to salute me."
He's told a physician.
"He's a human side," he says.
The head will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years, which is for his part since seventeen years in Elisea.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historical house built in 1850 was the proie of flames in the Old Quebec Friday Wednesday.
The simulation of four apartments, held at Hebert Street 15, made three alarms at the fire service.
The fire was declared before, but he rose up on the three stages of the imbecil.
France Voiselle, a portfolio of the Service for Protection against Quebec Incendies, stated that the rapid intervention of pumps has allowed to avoid spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a challenge of size for this city sector where the immobile is built in a reproached way.
The fired house opened four apartments, but no resident was located on the places at the time of the burning.
The damage has been limited, even if the water has caused disappointments.
An investigation will be carried out to determine the origin, but the sadgers have removed the tese from an act.
The Loup de Wall Street: out of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese leaves some images from his next movie, whose role is the role of a new Yorkian ambitious courtier, is incarnated by DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get out of your billets.
DiCaprio will cover you in his role of trading dignity.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "court in Long Island Bourse, which is to guard with the authorities in the framework of a large case of corruption in Wall Street".

The opportunity to follow his incredible ascension, but also the vertiginous fall that will follow it.

Deepness and excise in all kinds are the masters of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple has found the magic that had joined them in Shutter Island.
The outcome of the new Scorsese took a delay because of its too long mount.
It would be that the movie would last last 2:45.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate in the oscar course.
Coulson used the phone piratage to check a tube
The ancient editor of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "the phone piratage, monitoring and confrontation" to try to confirm a bidon ticket on a connection involved by the Minister of Interior, Charles Clarke.
The Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated before the court of the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a fake voice in May 2005, which Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pa日by, his "beauty special adviser".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper loaded Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to pirate the call box of Paīby and to "build permanently before his door", but Coulson also called it and left him voice messages.
"The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the director of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay before the people's house, expecting to surprise them, is the kind of man to love the story to people to see what they say," Mr. Edis said.
He said that notW used three ways to investigate the subjects: telephone piratage, monitoring and confrontation.
The head editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that it is at the core of the second, monitoring, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Does he know the phone pirateage?
He confirms the contrary, but we say, “Of course it is. ”
The sounds on a connecting Clarke were first recovered by the notW editorial office when a source, who tried a sexual attraction to Mrs. Paıby, said that it was said to her: "Do not lose your time with her, she is with Charles."
One band, which recorded by the pirated voice messages on his phone at least three times, was entered in Mulcaire's home in 2006.
The investigators also found records on the computer of the private detective who concerned Mrs. Paıby and his sister in a "Projects" dossier.
During the period in which the detective asked her, the grandparents of Ms. Paıby received anonymous calls where they were asked for information about it, Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, the former reporter of Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup monitored the monitoring of the smaller facts and gestures of Mrs. Pa日by.
In a vocal message that he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we are going to make tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that the involvement of Coulson in the history followed the same scheme as with other important men, such as the former Minister of Interior David Blutt.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Bluëtt about a relationship with a married woman while he himself often was Rebekah Brooks co-defence, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks haven't conspired with others to pirate phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 to 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted that they have performed telephone piratage.
Barack Obama receives the Iraq Prime Minister, full of violence
The American President had to receive Friday, 1 November 2013, the Iraq Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, seeking the United States assistance to fight the strongest wave of violence for five years.
In October, Iraq knew the most dead month in five and a half years, the numbers held by the Iraq authorities on Friday, 1 November.
964 people died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1 600 were hurt.
The United Nations gives an even higher balance with 979 dead and 1 902 injured.
These violences are increasingly murdered despite strengthened security measures and military operations for months by the Government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by the Chichis.
The total number of deaths in October has been the highest since April 2008, when 1 073 people were killed.
Two years after the return of American troops, the level of violence fears a new embrace while neighborhood is close to a civil war.
Bombs strike markets, muscles, marriages and funerals.
Mans are cast into a full street or even with them, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The widespread growth of the sunnite minority, to the power of Saddam Hussein, who claims to be political marginalised and to be the target of injust arrests, has promoted this flaming of violence.
Wednesday, new violence killed four people in north of Iraq, on the next day of the death of at least 26 people in a series of expectations, including the explosion of five cars in the north of Bagdad.
A lot of violence has been impelled to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group associated with Al-Qaida (Sunnite Extremistes), also involved in civil war.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "World War" against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the center of interviews in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, which will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their meeting on 12 December 2011.
At that time, the American president, chosen on the promise to end military commitment in that country, had made a optimistic table of the situation.
Since its arrival to Washington, Nouri Al Maliki multiplied the meetings with the exemplary, and the elections of the Congress.
Thursday, he made a pleasure for the international community to lead a "third World War" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increasing security aid in Iraq is supported by Republican and Democratic Senators.
But the last also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a closet, which assigned him the partial responsibility for the recovery of violence by its "sectoral and autoritarian policy".
They also requested Barack Obama to understand in Nouri Al Maliki that "Iran's pernicious influence in the Iraq Government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Pekin accuses an eyegroup of Tiananmen's attack
The Chine Internal Security Chief accused a group of Xinjiang's earlier separatists to be behind the expectation of the pig car that made five dead on the place of Tiananmen in the center of Pekin, Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, was based on the crowd on the famous place of the Chinese capital, symbol of the murder repression in 1989, and fired by killing his three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, member of the Political Bureau for Internal Security, accused the islamic movement of East Turkish to be the instigator of this attack.
Many augures, a turcophone minority installed in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province the East Turkey.
For the Chinese Government, this movement is responsible for often violent eruptions that are animated by independent reckoning.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Pekin has been organized and pre-medied," meng said at the Hungarian-Kongais Phoenix TV chain.
"The group held in coulisses was the Islamic movement of the East Turkey," he said, being renewed by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that it is an egghoure origin and indicated that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
It also contained recipients filled with essence and a flag with orthodox orthodox religious inscriptions.
The accident was 42 wounded.

Vatican surveys contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a large survey throughout the world on how parishes manage the sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and couples of similar sex.
The survey asks the participants how the priests care for the gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live without being joined by marriage links.
The survey was sent to each national conference of biscuits in mid October, with the consent of answers as far as possible.
The information will serve a significant race on the family that Pope François intends to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic Journal of the United States.
A portfolio of the Conference on Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each episode would decide in the appropriate way of paroisians.
In the United Kingdom, some bishops conducted the survey on the Internet by requesting Catholics to participate.
RDC: Army attacks the last fifth of the rebels
M23's irreductives, or some hundred warriors, were decreased at approximately 2000 metres of height on Chanzu, ≥yoonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Joba, two locations of about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the North Kivu province.
"This hasn't stopped since this morning, the fights continued despite the night," said a Jomba inhabitant, joined at 12:30 a.m., and a girl was hurt by ball on the morning.
"The intensity of confrontations has reduced a little," he said, "is that the RDC's armed FARDC forces have rejected the rebellion a little."
According to this witness who wants to stay anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" to Jomba before they went up to the front for a "race operation".
It was very straight behind him for food weapons of weapons.
From Bunagana, political fif and last strong place of rebellion fell on Wednesday, a journalist of the AFP could hear detonations of heavy arms.
According to a source of the United Nations Mission for the Stabilisation of the RDC, the fights were "in a final phase", the FARDC "included the positions of the M23 residual to deploy them".
Since the recurrence, Friday, between the Movement of 23 March (M23) and the Army, Monusco does not participate directly in fighting, but it provides to the Governing Groups a determining support for information, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several tens of soldiers, well provided in municipalities, went on the front line.
They were armed by kalachnikov and rockets.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, a border with Uganda, civilian military soldiers loaded a multiple rocket lance monted on a nine flaming truck of the FARDC, in order to ensure the rise of another engine piloting the positions of M23 on vatines.
The Congolian President, Joseph Kabila, called on Thursday evening once again the rebellion to "demobilize voluntaryly" against being disarmad by force, but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have discussed since December without results.
Instead, M23's political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have completed the speakers, there is no more than the Uganda mediation to organize the sign," said Roger Lumbala, President of the M23 delegation, without confirming this information immediately from the Government side.
M23 was born of a mutinery in April 2012 of ancient rebellious, mainly Tutsi, integrated in the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda to support M23, which rejects Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most deepest regions of the DCR, and its subsol is a source of convoided mineral resources.
In Bunagana, the Uganda border side, where about 5000 people were repeated between Monday and Wednesday of the United Nations, the return to the RDC that started early morning returned to midday.
"This morning we passed to go to our fields, but the military men told us to answer us," Imelda Nyirankusi, around her nine children, told the AFP Imelda Nyirankusi.
We have the impression that fire shots approach people.
At the beginning of the evening, tens of residents crossed the border, some with a matras on the head, to pass the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this scan beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in French or French, the songed and danced production takes their envelope.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds his voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical confirms it as a successful type.
Longtimes, from our Lady of Paris to Mozart the rock oper, most of the trials would be involved in the ridicule.
And successes such as Cabaret or the Miserables were carrying the mystery aureol.
The archae of Jean-L日 Choplin in Chattellet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the woman.
Today, these two scenes have the titles as successful tubes.
The first representation, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next world creation of "A American in Paris".
In Mogador, "The Bell and the Beast" may be one of the successs of the season.
On the other scenes, musical spectacles such as "1789", "Bastille's lovers" and small musical comes such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are placed in the range of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the Reference Book "Music Comedies Historys" and conference at the Castelet Theatre, analyze the reasons for so hardly conquered success.
How do French musical comes evolute?
The offer was demultiplicated.
There are the "music spectacles" that develop at the level of producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a real story as in 1789, the Amants of the Bastille.
Others make a bunch of 15 years back under pretext that we can use almost anything when we have Matt Pokora head of office.
Afterwards, we have musical comedies with the suspicious productions of the Castelet that make us live the age of Broadway's gold and discover the Universe of Stephen Sondheim, the biggest living compassor.
Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxone musical comedies by adapting them to French.
Independent French producers are trying to perceive.
But current projects such as "Rent", "The Baiser of the Arabic woman" or "The Awake of the Premium" are difficult to be financed.
Do we have enough artists able to play and dance like Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight music spectacles in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talent artists who turn projects on projects.
In the United States it is very different.
Young people are trained in many schools.
The jobs are many among regional, tourned theaters, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The lives of talents are thus as the number of posts to provide.
Why are tournaments in the province so successful?
Except the opera, the province remains the poor parent of the culture in France.
A few theatre pieces go to turn, and it is often the boulevard theater for adults and not for young adults.
Music spectacles end this missing.
These are the same young people who love telereality and what it produces as ephemer stars...
Proposing fine young men (softly talented) in the head of a musical spectacle is the assurance of an engaging of these young girls and often from their whole family.
Facebook pages of these spectacles are of course held by professionals who answer questions.
These spectacles are very expected when they arrive in a Zenith province.
Mayonnaise is mounted in Paris and delighted by the provincies.
The show is designed to enter all the large France rooms in the same form as in Paris.
A serious wound in an accident with a fantastic driver on the ring of Brussels
A road accident made a serious wound at Friday morning at 5:30, on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart's height, in the direction of Waterloo.
The car of a driver was gained by a fantom driver, who is recompensed for him.
The ring was closed at the time of the road, until 9:00 a.m., in the place of the a.m., and a expert determines the circumstances of it.
However, this situation has not been well caused by embustibilities because it has occurred at the height of Hoeilaart output.
Therefore, the process could be removed by this output/input of the ring.

RDC: Army prepares a new test
Children play on a carbonized blind, belonging to M23 rebels, in Kibumba, on 31 October 2013, in the East of the RDC.
The Congolese Army was prepared on Friday on a new trial against the last bases of M23 rebels near Bunagana, East of the RDC.
The goal is to deploy M23 of the vathines that surplus Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took Bugina's hill, which surrounds Mbuzi's.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from herself.
It'll stay only the hill of ́yonyi.
"The Chanzu is not very strategic," said the AFP Governor of the North Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku intends to return to Bunagana on Saturday.
Political and last strong place of rebellion, this location is located at the Uganda border, approximately 80 km north of Goma.
It was repeated Thursday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Since a few hundred inreductives of M23, there are nearly 2,000 meters of height on Chanzu, ≥yoonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and neighborhood of Jomba.
In Joba, a resident who had been fighting next Thursday all the day indicated that the situation was "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the warfare fights and were buried.
A girl was wounded by ball, and three other people were wounded, including a bitterly evacuated by the FARDCs, has acquired this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the recovery of the fights between FARDC and rebellion on October 25, the two belgermans did not give any balance of losses in huma's lives.
NSA revelations increase undertakings' paranoia as regards State monitoring
By a nice day of finishing along, a German police helicopter survived the British Consulat of Francfort, the German financial capital.
On the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German Information Agency, his mission was a photographer of the American front-post tower, which was at least 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BfV would hope to identify the presence of audience antins and that the operation had made a exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Affairs Minister in Berlin.
James ́pper, the director of the American Information Services, again insisted on the fact that the United States did not use their abilities for foreign information to "flow the industrial secrets of foreign companies for the account of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or to increase their benefits".
But since Edward Snowden, the adviser, became a denunciator, began to deal with his undesirable treasure of information on the secrets of the United States' monitoring, the European governments and business leaders have no idea if the Director should believe in the word.
Reports, which the National Security Agency has spent the Brazilian Petrovas petrol company and has access to data contained by American storage services providers in the Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever understood the paranoia of companies in relation to State Monitoring.
The revelation that the German Channel phone of Angela Merkel had been pirated, perhaps even for a decade, was the water cup that made the vessel overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be mentioned, the business leaders must also be potential objectives.
Snowden has made the intensive intensity between American information services and companies.
I think it is designable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"German must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, representing German SMEs in the TI sector.
The German companies believe that the United States represents such a significant risk as China in the case of industrial and data-flow spinner, an investigation which was held in July by the EY Council Cabinet.
However, in all documents revealed by Mr Snowden, there is nothing that the United States have transmitted foreign business secrets to American companies.
Political men were concerned about the idea that the EU does not have sufficient information and Internet capacity and think that it should strive to reduce its dependency towards the United States.
Business leaders are sceptical about this issue.
A member of the German Parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close the eyes and open them slowly...
"This is not the right way to do," indicates Hasso Plattner, president of the German business software company, SAP.
If we wanted a European high TI industry, it would not be necessary to let it go 20 years ago.
Everything is subventioned in Germany, carbon to car, by agricultors.
All other than the TI industry.
However, the width and sophistication of American spinner agencies exposed to Snowden's revelations were a shock for certain companies that thought that China was the biggest risk of monitoring.
A big change is being made in the cloud information because European responsibles have realized that the data contained in the United States are regulated in accordance with the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to an investigation carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional agency rejected about 10% of the non-American members to use a American storage service provider in the cloud after the reports on the US Data Exploration Programme.
Jim Snabe, SAP co-director, says: "Our clients today ask us a question they did not ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you assure me that they will remain in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders indicate that the last reports are only a confirmation of what they already know, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at any price.
It is not surprising that there is an economic campaign.
There's always been.
"It is a subject that has been repeated for many years and has not changed anything in the current discussion," Kurt Bock, director-General of the BASF chemicals producing society.
The Americans are spending us on commercial and industrial level as we spy them, because it is in the national interest of defending our business.
Company leaders are usually low to reveal the preventive measures they have taken, where this would allow the benefit of an opposer.
The large companies have long marted the message which is at least imprudent to obtain a free USB key at a professional room or to leave a mobile chair without supervision in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the Audi Car Construction Board, says that the collection of mobile phones before the Council meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, is a coherent practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones prepaid in their travel to the foreign because of the risk of achievement of smartphone integrity.
Prepaid phones are then cast.
However, we are afraid that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to pirating and monitoring.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their special nine.
"SMEs are often missing experience, staff and financial resources to protect their industrial secrets effectively against unapproval access," BfV warns in a report.
The United States warns their own companies about the economic spending activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NI) carried out by the United States in February, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty to the second degree of conducting economic information piratage acts behind China, The Washington Post.
A member of the Governing Board of a renamed German company estimated that in the case of economic campaign, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, an ancient director of French internal information, the DCRI, said in this month: "The services know perfectly that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spending their aliens."
Parents of a teenager in Georgia, who is dead in insolite circumstances, think that their son has been embraced
Parents of a teenager in Georgia, whose body was found in a battle store rolled in his school gimnase, thinking that their son was born, said the lawyer of the family Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11 in a supported cup behind his school gymnasis.
The investigators of the Sheriff of the Court of Lowndes concluded that Johnson was dead in insolite circumstances, but the 17-year-old young boy's family contests these conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son has been born," said the lawyer Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the conclusions of the sheriff.
“ They think that it is a challenge for any logic, laws of the law and common sense, ” he said.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered in the only purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to the olive with a cartridge, and they brought him into a mortal sack," he said.
The prosecutor of the United States Michael Moore stated Thursday that he conducted an official investigation on Johnson's death, highlighting that several important questions remained without answer.
What's the cause of death?
Is his death the result of an act?
Moore expressed himself at a Friday afternoon with a press conference.
I'm going to follow the facts where they're going.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I think there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was killed by “positive asphyxie”.
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, Moore.
"Several questions still deserve a response or confirmation," he said.
Moore said that if he sets on the day of natural elements to justifie a civil or criminal investigation on Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Sheriff of the Lowndes County office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him Thursday.
A South Georgian judge ordered the authorities to submit all the video surveillance records that the investigators had examined.
The teenage parents said that they would hope that video images contain indications on the circumstances of his death.
CDC's advice on allergies in schools
Wednesday, the American Centre for Control and Prevention of diseases has made a series of directives indicating how to manage children's food allergies at the oil.
It is the first series of direct lines that the US government is, since the number of children of age suffering from food alergies has intensely hit.
A child of 20 in the United States today suffers of food allergy.
The CDC discovered that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information intended for schools on how to enhance the teacher body and staff with food allergies in children and how to treat them in case of allergic reaction.
He also recommends schools to have a stock of epinephrine – the EpiPen-marked self-injector, which is the most corely used – to be able to respond quickly in case of potentially mortal anaphylaxia.
The islative meetings of the States have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have easier than stocked epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms that children have allergic reactions.
Children can say, "I have the impression that something guess me the language," "I have the impression of having a hair on the language" or "I have picotments on the language".
The NSA case emphasises the total debat on information
How can you explain the contradictional attitude of the French Government, who, from one side, is open to public by calling the United States Ambassador on 21 October, and on the other hand prohibits the surplus of the territory by the presidential plane of Bolivian, on the basis of the voice of presence at Edward Snowden's border?
I think there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Holland phones at Barack Obama or when the Minister for Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius calls the Ambassador of the United States, they respond to a real discovery, which is the width of the American monitoring on the enclosure of communications in France.
Isn't it surprising to read in the World Columns in a few weeks of interval from one part the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and, on the other hand, a condemnation of the hearing of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be a vague hypocrisy from you?
The journalist approach is not a moral position, but the research of interest and information that allows each citizen to make a view.
When WikiLeaks lifts up the wheel on the analysis by the American political diplomacy or other in the world, we consider that this is a significant lighting in view of the American power.
When we describe the US interception systems against the French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to disappoint us of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA on terrorist operations with regard to our interests?
Can we be disappointed from the American employment?
The establishment of very powerful interception tools by the United States since ten years, but also by France, was officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States, in particular, set out procedures for cooperation and exchange of almost daily information, which are described as essential, and otherwise.
For example, Mohammed Merah's presence in the tribe areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through NSA.
France can, for example, be conducted to transmit all data blocks on the Sahel region to American services, and, in contrast, it has already been said quickly - the Americans can provide information to the French about other regions of the world.
Thus, the issue of fund behind this case is not the ability or the right of the countries to provide interception tools, but the question of the total absent of pre-debating, in particular within the Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter which must be theirs, and, finally, the question of the effects of freedoms.
What are the United States really risking? Degradation of their image?
We're nice to declare them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk of the Americans may be double.
The first is when their allied - and this was the case recently - they realize that their leaders, sometimes at the top top of their State, were monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been drawn up.
Another effect may be more economically: more than European or South American companies, in light of the revelations, aim to provide their confidential data to American providers subject to the American laws, and therefore to the NSA.
Last element: the wide movement of revelations involved by media of the world, which contributes to the initiation of a debate on the practice of monitoring of information services until then almost inexhistant, could move the islators, including the Americans, to review the powers they have given to their information services.
Parents of intersexuated children can choose "undetermined sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for food born with ambiguous sexual organs.
Man or female of the newborn sex will no longer be assigned to their birth.
In the context of the new law, parents will no longer be able to declare their child's sex, allowing them to enter a "indetermined" or "non-specified" sex on its birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure that was weakened on the eggs of parents that could take priority decisions on sexual reassignation surgery for their feed, and to fight discrimination against inter-sexuated persons.
According to the BBC, a intersexual person would have said years later, “I am not a man or a woman. ”
I'll stay the patch'k that the doctors created, contusioned and balafred.
It's estimated that a child of 2,000 born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexuated, the intersexuality of the sex-sixantine group of diseases as sexual development disasters, a generic term designing persons possessed of chromosomes or atypical (oven or testical) or abnormally developed sexual bodies.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersected.
Sexual identification is still not well comprehensive, but most of the United States specialists say that when sex is not able to be determined, it is better to use the best information available to allocate it, then to wait and follow the psychological and child's development before considering a surgical act, where appropriate.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatric in New York and a specialist of sexual identification issues, said that the new German law “be a good idea”.
Intersexuated children have a ethical dilemma.
“ Some people suffer extremely serious diseases that need a surgery, but that is not the case of most children, ” he said.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and see how identity develops.
The science that consists of knowing how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question to know why this happens.
It's like mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described individuals intersexuated as different from trans-sexual or transgenous persons, since their status is not related to sex but not to their biological constitution, which is not either men or women's, but is generally both at the same time and not fully defined as one or another.
These characteristics can be shown in secondary sexual characters (e.g. muscle mass, pilosity, poitrine and status), primary sexual characters (e.g. reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also reviewed the discrimination against inter-sexual and transgenous persons in the field of employment, as well as the width of the acts of harcement and violence and crimes motivated by prejudices.
Youths of non-compliance boys now have camps that are specially designed to them.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world who had been recognized “neutral” after having gained his calling procedure that enabled him to keep a “non-expected ” sex in life.
The German passengers will conduct a third name at M or F-X for intersexual, the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbor France, gender issues are always subject to conflicts, a broad report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of isolators in this Catholic country signed a petition for the “theory of genres ” to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also opposed the German law, writing that “the world is trapped into a new government where the kind is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed. ”
In Maryland, the mother of a food also said about Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be assigned to children when they were born.
"The role of parent is quite stressing without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's sex," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historyly, children born without male or female sex organs were called Hermaphrodites, according to the name of the Greek magnificent god who had a double sex.
And almost a decade of years ago, the medical community viewed the type as a hazard, which can be effected and on which it can be re-seen.
But now, many are those who reject the ethical foundation of the surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be thrown, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignation when he grows.
“ In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency, ” said Drescher.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiater, we were phoned to the chirurgian.
The dominant theory on how to treat children as ambigus sexual organs was the doctor John Money, at the University of Johns-Hopkins, which believed that the kind was unleavenable.
He dedicated the term “sexual identity” and supported that social and environmental signals – the way parents embrace a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to form it in order to be identified as male or female sex.
But in a case of 1966, known as “Joan/Joan”, his theories have occurred to conflicts.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut in a broken circumcision to cast him completely, taking the testicules to him, and educating him as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful case of transition, but it wasn't the case," Drescher said.
At approximately 15 years of age, he returned a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he suicided himself.
Drescher said that some doctors “repeat always this model. ”
But in the 1990s, with the Internet's army, those who have survived these sexual change operations say: “They are not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer of Montana, who was born with XY-made chromosomes but ambigus sexual organs.
The doctors couldn't really say if he had a wide clitorist or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "comprehensive life" as a man.
So a little while after her birth in 1976, Bruce was a surgery of the external body and of the witnesses and was raised as a girl.
He was taken from women's hormones at 12 years of age.
"I knew I was not a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he was a vaginoplastia.
But depressed and realized that something was not worth, he asked his medical dossier.
What he had covered was terrified.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) which prevented its body from produced enough testosterone so that its sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, a man returned, following a testosterone treatment and removed the breasts.
The surgery made it sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in a organization called Interface Project, who is trying to normalize the perception of intersexuated people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Director-General of the non-acquisitive organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, fearing that the German law “invites to labelling and stigmatization”.
"Multiple activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make rapid decisions and give their children a "indetermined" sex," she said.
We are afraid that it encourages interventions.
We think it'd be better to award a man or female sex, and wait.
But we haven't seen what the law would give, so we can only advance hypothesis.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law because " she allows adults to choose to be recognised under the third sex call."
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a genre,” she said.
The German law relates to sexual addiction to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead to that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, specialised radiolog in the mammographies in Pittsburgh, whose girl has reached a deterioration of sexual development and helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law will "see" parents and children.
The daughter of Dr. Baratz, Katie, is born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called a complete sindrome of integrity to the androgene.
Because of the deficiency of its androgene recipients, Katie developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagin, but she doesn't have heroes or ova.
Today, 29 years old, Katie is married and internally in an infantile psychiatric at the Pennsylvania University.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through the service of adoption or portrayal mothers.
“The law leaves a certain wide range to parents so that they do not have to make decisions of hazards, ” said Baratz.
This allows them to make some tests and understand them, and a time before entering "man" or "women".
So, everything's fine – you can educate your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You do not have to predict for an irreversible surgery intervention.
"This puts children in the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what is necessary," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/ she feels the most at age – and it's something amazing.
This allows the child to take the decision for himself.
Letta trusted in the long-term of his government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta considers that its Government will hold up until 2015 despite the strong pressures between left and right within the coalition to the power to approach the Senat vote to exit Silvio Berlusconi from its mandate.
In an interview at the Daily La Stampa, the Left Centre leader said that he would have "closed the intention" to continue to rule with its coalition until the next islative elections of 2015.
The high room of the Italian Parliament will meet within the month currency to determine the trial of the former President of the Council condemned for tax fraud.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to return its support to the Government if the Senate, where he counts more opponents than parties, states his destitution.
But a part of his camp, aggregated around the National Secretary of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as she showed on 2 October, that it was to cease to Berlusconi's injunctions, which already wanted to hit the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an American Transport Safety Agency agent, TSA, and a suspicious has been hurt during the exchange of fire coups.
Pompers called on the drama sites have said that they had responded to a call of "multifold wounds".
"The order forces are on place," says the airport on Twitter account, while the TV images would show people evacuated in ambulances.
" There was a fusillade," said a port of the American Transport Safety Agency (TSA).
The local antenna of ABC showed a person evacuated on a card, and a second transported on a rolling wheel.
The incident occurred at 9:30 local (12:30 to Montreal) at the 3th terminal of the airport, also indicated the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that the teminals 2 and 3 are in evacuation.
The TSA portfolio was not able to confirm immediately if one of its employees was hurt.
All flights at the airport and on the airport were suspended.
The Israeli army kills a member of Hamas in Gaza-sces
Israeli car rents killed a Palestinian islamic military of Hamas on Thursday and he grew worse another in the south of the Gaza band, learned after sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting in this region was exploded, because Israeli cars were cut off the border and were mentioned by the Palestinian murderers.
The Israeli army was pleased to call a "destined action" in the nearby area of a qualified tunnel of "terrorist" by the Hebrew State, buried at the border and whose covering was in the middle of October.
Report: The Obama campaign considered to fall Biden for Hillary Clinton
The nearest advisers of President Barack Obama considered, in the greatest secret, to replace President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the list of 2012, New York Times.
This revelation is the most wonderful event contained in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the book to appear on Thursday evening and told that the neighbors of the president had conducted “profonded travels in groups and investigations in end 2011” to see if Biden's evasion could help Obama to reelect its hopes.
According to the politician of Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of the higher responsible for the campaign and the Black House, namely the former Secretary-General of the House Bill Daley, aiming to measure the impact of the replacement of the President by the former Clinton State Secretary.
The possibility of exchange is a secret that has been closely kept within the Chicago campaign QG and within the oval Bureau.
Only a half-dozen nearby advisers of the president – particularly Daley, the former leader of the campaign of Obama Jim Messina and the elderly advisers in the House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe – is that the change was in the study.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley was charged to replace Biden, despite their “heavy personal links” before finally decided against the change when the numbers showed that Clinton had on the presidential list “not would just improve the chances of Obama's success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually intended to replace Biden by Clinton.
"I said I had examined a series of questions, and it was one of them," Daley said in the journal.
Remember that at that moment the President was not in form, and we said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified the "concerned" review, Martin told the CNN Anderson Cooper that the reelecting campaign had much investment to discover whether the change would be beneficial during the investigation.
"The campaigns do not dedicate much money to investigations and discussion groups unless they are seriously intended to take measures," Martin said on 360.
However, we don't know whether Obama was at the moment that his team examined the replacement.
Martin said about CNN he had asked Daley if his patron was at that time at the core of the possible management.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the president was "in the core" of the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin said that "Double Down" did not finally answer the question to know whether political investigations had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama knew not that Biden's exemption from the presidential list was examined.
"Perhaps," answered Martin.
Do you want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on medication.
Charlie Francis took part of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop an easier.
He had the idea after reading a medical study and convinced Chinese scientists to recreate chemically the protein.
Ice cream reacts with the language by increased protein pH to make it.
Chris explains that since the ice cream begins to wear when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more we laugh, the more it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company Lick Me I'm Delicious, said: "It's something incredible but we're still at the beginning of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about 200 £."
The protein we use in ice reacts with neutro pH language.
So when your mouth hits the protein, the level of pH increases and ice begins to grow.
We tested it in the past months, and it seemed appropriate to share it with all at Hallowen because it gives an extraordinary effect.
It's probably the dearest ice I created because the scarceness of medicines is four times more dear than gold.
So every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But she has pretty good go!
The company at the experimental approach of Charlie, based on Bristol, is known for its ice parffs such as beer, wheat, bow and gold.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He said: “I would really want to develop an ice in”.
It is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by ice cristals that constitute ice cream, but I think I will find a way to reach it.
Ice uses fluorescent properties of medus synthetised by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a chi-time session
The song Lou Reed died while he performed Tai chi exercises, repeated his wife Laurie Anderson on Thursday in a letter held by the regional journal "East Hampton Star" and intended for the people of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist was dead last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, while he looked at the trees and performed the 21st beauty of tai chi, with his hands of musicians who were looking for air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was Master Tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The song's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to get her out of the hospital and to take her to their house in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are a citizen, it's our spiritual house.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will send to many people the wonderful joy of living that he had," she said.
Lou Reed had recently taken a feed secret in May.
Halloween 2013 : In numbers
When I was young, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat bonbons, to go to sleep late and to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more deep.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed a single bonbon and I'm sure I'm not going to do it anymore this year.
But the states show that I'm the galeous sheep when we're talking about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them — will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of 6,9 Md$ in bonbons, decorations and decorations, the National Retail Federation.
What I have done with impatience at every Halloween festival, these are the trends.
Debugs should represent 1.2 Md$ on the expenditure of 6.9 billion, NRF.
This year, sexy inanimated objects become angry.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they may also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carots.
For men, I can see many zombies, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I assume that the men of the Daft Punk space will be among our photos of Instagram this year.
According to Google, the most searched dishes are zombies, Batmans, pirates and shoes.
I guess there's nothing wrong to stay traditional.
We've cut our dogs last year and, in my great surprise, they were not the only ones.
In fact, the Americans will cost $330 for animal dishes this year, NRF.
It makes many curious dogs in hotdogs.
When it's bonbons, we don't glonde.
The Americans will cost 1.9 Md$ in bonbons this year, the Nielsen cabinet.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sucettes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is a great news for the 41 million children who go to the bonbons in their neighborhood, the American Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, don't tell us stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Maïs bones are the only thing we don't want to eat; and yet nearly 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, the National Confecters.
This represents approximately 9 billion milk grains.
It's a mystery that I'm not coming to excite yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), " Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1 200 haunted houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about 500 M$ income, the American Haunts, and that includes these beautiful photos of you in your way to pick you up your friends on Facebook and that you can't remove and on which one type that you love well leaves a comment of the "beauty head".
Finally, let's talk about citrus.
Charlie Brown presented us the Great Citro ́ when we were ́s, and sculpting a citro ́ in the form of lantern, it's like covering a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we're all small.
Happy for us, “the trend of the baby-citro” has only started last year through Pinterest, so most of us have sculpted these potatoes and haven't been sitting inside.
This year, the Americans will cost about $106 in citrus, the U.S. Census Bureau.
The citro-lanternes that flourish dongly on your house's porch were likely coming from I'n I'nois, where 542 million citro's have been cultivated this year.
If you are trying to make more note, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon to Napa, California, and try to sculp their 922 kg citro.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create inside a deficiency structure ("bad bank") which will include 38 billion livres (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, measured to maintain its relations with London and accelerated its privatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance in the next two years and hopes that it has completely cleaned it in the three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for depreciation of additional doubt credits from four to 4.5 billion books on the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantoning structure.
RBS also pointed out that this internal revolution would free from 10 to 11 billion capital books and thus strengthen its capacity to provide.
The Bank and London highlighted that the "bad bank" would allow a trade on the past, particularly the government who was accused of joining RBS management.
"We can now go forward, we are concerned about the future and 90% of the assets who are really good banks and build a large bank for the customer and the United Kingdom," said the new director-General Ross McEwan at the press.
Land Rover announces its parking of a series of rallys
Inside, there are 6-point-sheets of baquet and seats of harnage, as well as an Intercom system.
Among the options, including improved freshes, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanisms, logistic support and the holding of the vehicle between two events.
Drew Bowler, Director-General of Bowler Motorsport, said: "Bowler's amateurs who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experimented, some are looking for excitation and aventure and real access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such a partnership approach with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try in different forms of railways in the United Kingdom and internationally, and to prepare ourselves for the rigours and realities of raid railways.
We had much to enjoy developing the vehicle of the Defender Challenge – the championnat will really be painting. ”
Furthermore, the Defender Challenge will propose a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the North African deserts and the Middle East.
The pumpers were called to secure a lost kit after remaining 15 m above the ground on an instable corner in a career
Ruby, a Spanish cocker, was disappeared after an accident of the road without gravity.
It was found three days later by a person who passed his dog in the career
The pumpers came down in the memory of the cold to recover the dog and save it from a certain death
A chiot had the chance to escape the worst after the pumpers were called to recover it safely while it was because at 15 m above the ground on the instable soil of a falace.
Ruby, a 9-month Spanish cocker, disappeared after an accident of the road afternoon and survived for three days alone before he was saved in a Friday career.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 years old, returned to the Flappit career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thank the West Yorkshire Incendie Service.
They had discouragedly searched for their lost dog and launched a call on social network sites after she disappeared in the career after an accident without gravity.
At 14:15 Thursday, a person who walked in his dog found Ruby on a corner in the career, covered at 15 m above the ground.
A team of technical shopping of the Cleckheaton pumpers' casher was running on the sites and descended in a reminder to save Ruby using a pipe for animals to carry it up to the floor.
Andy ́yton's team specialist said: "It was in a preconditional situation."
It was in the middle of the floor, at 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely didn't move during the salvation – she was ice.
But she's fine now.
She ate biscuits after.
It was a very spectacular call.
It's incredible that someone noticed the dog.
Peter Lau said, "Ruby had a lot of chance to get out of it freely."
She could have been seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was conducted by the veterinary for a control; its general state was satisfied, other than exhaust and dehydrate.
Mrs. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified by watching the secure."
I don't have to think she was there.
It was surprising to have it again in the arms.
The veterinary said that if she had been too exhausted and that she had disappeared, she would probably fall.
The pumpers were awesome.
What they did was really courageous.
They are so amazing, each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson, of Keighley, said: "We were afraid that she falls but she did not move."
The pumpers were great.
I can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger said he never drove Katy Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an entrepreneur during an Australian radio emission this week, the pop star said she was a chorist on the Jagger's song 'Old Habits Die Hard' in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock's veteran and explained, "He dropped me when I was 18 years old."
She said, "It was a long time ago, and it was very worthwhile."
In a Thursday statement, a 70-year representative of Jagger stated that he had “no categoryally made progress to Katy Perry”.
The representative said: "It may be that she confunds it with someone else."
Perry was one of the songs to make a appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, Prism, was born at the first place of the charts this week.
Peking causes a Turkish islamic movement
"The support in coulisses in expectation came from the Islamic Movement of East Turkish, based on Central and West Asia," said the Chinese security bodies patron to a television chain in Hong Kong, a video set on Thursday night on a web site.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Chinese political office (PCC), was expressed in Tachkent during an official visit in Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese responsible designs a special organization after Monday's expectation.
According to the Chinese police, three Uïghours of the same family of the Muslim dominant region of Xinjiang, the frontier of several Central Asian countries, precipiented their car loaded by basic bidons against the entrance of the City prohibited in Pekin, in a suicide attack that made two dead and 40 injured.
The car driver, his wife and his mother lost in the car burning.
The Etim, which states that it is for the indipendence of the East Turkish, an ancient name of the Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the associated organizations in Al-Qaida.
This movement is often designed by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is doubted by several experts.
George Kerevan: Europe's relaxation gives the choice to Scotland
Another day, another anxious story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Court would have to join the European freedom area to be able to join the EU.
And here we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbelated sons through the wall of Hadrien.
If it is true that the Strathclyde journal has indicated the possible economic refunds of a greater freedom of dealing with the rest of Europe, however, it was not in the large titles (and it was to be predicted).
Nobody said that the Member States of the EU were dedicated to a large part of their time to turn their formal rules on them.
Since Scotland is not a part of the Schengen space for the moment, a continuous non-respect of the rules would be a bitter consent that Brussels could offer in contrast to what it wants to the Swiss.
So this is a story that isn't one.
And a story so old that she is now fixed: I have heard the bobard for the first time, which "indipendence means the control of passports" over 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dust account.
Why should an independent Ecosse actually follow the instructions of Europe?
Why to exchange London's yoke against Brussels, especially now?
This is the true presentation of Europe: the great after-government plan to unify Europe is permanently dead.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Through Europe, the parties opposing the EU or fighting for the abandon of the euro as a common devise win the land.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany, based only this year and reached nowhere, gathered nearly five million votes at the federal elections of September and went out the Democratic Liberal Party (equivalent to our liberals-democracy) of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the draft creation of a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a tournament.
The extent imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with carcinoma on national economys through a single currency, led to many people to think that the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro is not important to see the national governments recording budgetary deficits – it was just true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has emphasized its members of favorable change rates to German exporters – what German politicians want to keep.
Without a possibility of assessing the national devise, South European countries are faced with an internal productivity problem towards Germany.
The only resource is to make shadows in the salaries and expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper disease related to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for subventing French and German energy sector companies to consumer costs – the European industry pays two times more for election and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is an inconvenience in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All salaries in the world will not prevent the European petrochemic industry from being penalized by a good American skist gas.
As a result, the revolt, particularly in France, is one of the major minors of the EU.
After war, the French political elite considered the EU a way to control Germany and put Paris on a feet of equality with Washington.
But Berlin has no longer needed Paris as a passport of its political stability and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, allowing the French economy to fail.
Result: Marine Le Pen's right extreme part, the Anti-European National Front, has just received a crucial partial election, sending socialists back to the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the suffocations – a suitable warning for the British Worklist Party that reminds him that it is not able to leave from the principle only that a right division will automatically promote the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with his new popularity at the French white work class?
It wants to use European elections for the next year to create a single and anti-European block within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties make a good figure of these elections, what is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon the anti-European and unique anti-monnage feeling in Europe will be united and will end by killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will be more to the "Europe of the Nations" freely privileged by the General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economy could keep the euro, but France and South Europe will find their own department.
I believe that the United Kingdom takes its distances in relation to this project, and I hope that it will make the United States quiet.
However, Washington's growing interest for the implifant allows to think that Great Britain will be left in the Atlantic.
What about the Ecosse in all of this?
We can decide to be a small-letter region (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, including sending forward Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland would be able to agree with a more free European agreement as we maintain our own view.
Cooperation with other countries in similar views would be easier in an Europe of Non-Federal Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP Government of Ecosse is – and it is to note – the political movement of anti-exterity that has been best successful in Europe, since it has received a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed shadows (and implemented) by the Chancellier of the Equie of Worklist, Alistair Darling, and the coalition of conservators/democratics who followed.
It would now be ridiculous for the Scotland to vote for the independence if it is to accept the externity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Previous pubertation: Old Before
Studies show that young African and Spanish girls are tend to reach the age of publicity as early as the white girls.
Changes do not mean that publicity is imminent
Nothing proves only hormones or other chemical substances are responsible
Experts think that obesity epidemic could be a leader of the previous publicity.
The trend towards a previous puberty is not also pronounced in boys
The older CNN Pat Etheridge is a special journalist in family and health issues in the child.
Should a mother worry if the pubs and pouls of her daughter begin to grow to 7 or 8 years?
During the annual conference of the American A≥ my of Pediat, which held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinolog, explained that these recent changes are sufficiently coherent among the young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I've spent a lot of time to reassure parents – generally, this does not lead to a quick evolution to the full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Clear signs of development, such as breast bourging, powder under the arms and the public area and bodies, appeared early in the girls.
But there was only an advanced age of the first rules in the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and half, while he was 12 and three quarters in 1970.
“ Once the poitrine began to develop, at least two or three years before the first rules appear, ” said Caplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Co.“
The time is the most precise test to know how to develop publicity.
There is a debate about the real appearance of publicity, but it is considered as "precedent" when the development of poitrine is accompanied of a sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development relaxed or stops – it is something that a child can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justifie tests made by an endocrinolog to avoid serious problems such as tumors or coasts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to prevent other consequences: a pre-mature age of bones that can reduce growth and a small size at adult age.
Medical and hormonal treatment recommendations are based on child age, development rate, growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is aware of medicines but recognizes that “the fact of control of publicity can reduce certain behavior problems and feelings for young girls to be different from others”.
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
“ They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they will handle hygiene issues, ” Kaplowitz said.
“ It was a shock, ” recalls a woman whose girl had the first rules of 10 years.
Even if there were signs and we had spoken of rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She returned from the fearful and boiled oil to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the knowledge of the public on the causes of previous publicity.
However, there is no coherent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals presented in the environment or sexual messages carried out by media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Caplowitz claims that the most reliable hypothesis is the epidemic of obesity.
He participated in a study conducted on 6-9-year-old girls who read the percentage of fat mass at the start of publicity.
Other discoveries support this conclusion, but there are many other important factors.
In this country, young African and Spanish girls have tend to reach the age of publicity as early as the white girls.
There are several explanations.
Worldwide, the mechanisms of previous puberty are affected by all, economic conditions in climate, by genes.
Another problem: Although boys have pools on the face and in the younger public area, the trend towards a real previous puberty is not as pronounced by girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference insisted on the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of the acne and public poles is coherent, even in foods and all-small.
"We must be able to be able to identify the real appearance of publicity," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologer working at the hospital for children Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not demand advice to their child to know how to talk to their child.
“ This may mean to have a conversation more early than planned, ” Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
The girls whose publicity is previously need to be assured of the fact that even when it happens earlier than planned, the process is part of life.
Homming to the people of the brothers Coen
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the brothers Coen, the Gred Price of the Last Festival of Cannes, is a nostalgic and fun film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and the people's music that just started to resume it before Bob Dylan's army.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose films have just been subject to a retrospective to the French Chinese, had discussed the golden palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Without ability to embarrass Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have cast their turn on the stars of the American movie, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the pop planet star Justin Timberlake.
In this fucking movie where music is a central person and the songs directly interpreted, Oscar Isaac shows himself a musician and song of people made, while Timberlake, his friend in the movie, leaves the pop for people's music with a constant jubilation.
As regards Carey Muʹgan, she left the rich around Daisy Muʹgan in "Gatsby the great" for less reluctant clothes, a sweet voice when she sing, but the jury devoted to the mitraillet when she talks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" rage on a week the tribulations of a people's song who doesn't come to persevere and worry about the whole earth.
He accepts the replacements of the feet raised in the studios.
Without an apartment, he turns on his friends' captains who still want to receive it.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that is what we were interested in: a misfortune mixture, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not carrierist but integral, with self-destructive behaviour," said at the press Ethan Coen, covered with his brother Joel of several Oscars and price in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis doesn't exist, the two people's musician fans have built their story on real personalities of the time like the people of Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the time of the Greenwich village's event, this quarter of New York called to become "the epicter of the people's music that would be born of international stars" as writer of the journalist Eliah Wald, Van Ronk's friend.
The movie then takes a documentary time, an invaded 33T invade music label, invaded by an old secretary, the musical choices of studies of the time and the coffee where songs were.
The magic of the brothers Coen still works in a funny personality that is going through the film permanently: a beautiful red cat at the crazy look, a happy companion of Llewyn Davis.
Asked about how he composed his personality, the actor and song Justin Timberlake had reminded of having "great in Tennessee, buried by blue and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar," he said.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be considered good", "the hazard can also start somebody's career", and "the more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who makes any compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to let us go through everything that can prevent us from expressing us."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He will never have known the retraite word.
The French edition phénomène, Gérard de Villiers, died Thursday at 83 years of age, came just to hold his 200th SAS, "The Vengeance of Kremlin".
In February, New York Times had dedicated him as "the author of the spinners who knew it too much."
Then he had spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theater of 198 and 199 works of the famous series of spinners.
Decreased by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he moved during this travel with a dembulator.
And before Afghanistan, he was also distributed in Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SASs per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, was providing to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, nearly half a century ago.
"No doubt between 120 million and 150 million all confunded countries," he progressed last March.
His birman cat on the knees, in the large apartment of his big apartment of the Avenue Foch at two steps from the Triomph Arc, the evil eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which the SAS adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not counting the pirate editions," he said, designing a table of books on the low table between brass or ivoires reported in 130 arpented countries to guard its romans.
For the price of a cigarette package, the player has the right to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman at the beneficial poitrine, with a gun or a basket.
Inside, his Serenissime Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, desarranged Austrian aristocrat and contractual agent of the ↓ to pay family chat repairs, starts to all the wicked in the earth, 70s and 80s, and then joadists from the 90s.
In each book, the same input: a large dose of geopolitic and exoticism, some hard sex scenes, a set of violence and torture.
"I never had the prospect of being a literary author," Gérard de Villiers explained.
I think I'm a container who writes for foods of people to whom I don't send a message.
He worked "as the large war reporters of the type Albert London, who went back and returned with real and long investigations."
SAS's father said "to make a kind of geopolitical fe."
"I am permanently my dossiers (Afghanistan, ↑, ...) before I leave," Gérard de Villiers.
Instead, I have met journalists, including the AFP, diplomates, people of the services I know for some for twenty or thirty years.
In fact, many of its SAS are often premonitory: so, a month before the attack of a Syrian regime's commanding center who killed several higher responsibles, he had told the story in the "The Way of ○".
In the "The Fous of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret command center in this city, a barrier of the Libyan rebellion.
In 1980, he scened the Egyptian president Anouar El-Sadate's scenario in the "The Complot of Caire", a year before the waiting.
In October 2012, in "Panique in Bamako", he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on Malean capital.
I'm not surprised, he defended himself, I'm just doing hypotheses from the countries I know well and some of my hypotheses in time are accomplished.
After these travels in often trooped areas, he was installed for a month behind his machine to write IBM in margarith from 1976 "when all the pieces were changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to ́lo.
At the walls of his office, there are AK-47 asylum areas, erotic photos and photos of the author with African war masters.
It is regularly used for machism by feminists and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers separated these words into two phrases.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I'm always accepted in Africa where I count many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age."
He will not die and go back.
Not more than me.
Aeroplaners care about the width of the seats while great commands are in play
The dispute makes anxiety between the large aircraft manufacturers about the width of the tourist class's seats on long-course flights, opening the road to an amazing confrontation at the Dubai airport room that is located in the middle.
The conflict leads to the width of the seats proposed on long-cour flights to the passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most shortaged by air companies, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the last equipment presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called the airport industry to establish a standard that imposes a seat size of at least 18 pounds (45,72 cm) in the economic classes, but its large American Rival Boeing states that it should be for air companies to decide.
The difference claimed while the planners were trying to sell even greater versions of their long-term bimotor aircraft, expecting probably a record of orders in the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way the seats will be available behind the plane – in particular 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the "mini-jumbo" segment.
Boeing states that his reamenated "777X" will be able to collect 406 people in more than 17 pounds of width, and will be configured with 10 seats per range.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 persons in economic classes in 18 pounds of width set up in 9.
Aeroplane gentlemen often exchange shops on technical issues by making publicity in the professional press.
Today Airbus calls it directly to the public before the Dubai airport, where 777X should take steps on his competitors with more than 100 orders.
Recently, we have been able to realize what could be the beginning of a new public war with the presentation of a photo's finance showing three people each other in the restaurant, titled "Should you accept this?".
"Boeing proposes long-cour flights at more heavy seats than in regional tourist aircrafts," said John Leahy, Airbus Trade Director.
As food habits change, people grow, but aircraft seats have not been radically changed.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing's 747 jumbo defined the long-cour travelling, and the tourning of the century, the average weight of the American weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, the data of the American Department of Health.
The average American tour of the 20th century is 39.7 pounds, the American health statistics.
Airbus states that his rival is growing up to a seat concept that dates since 1950, when the circonference of the freshly baptized device 'jet set' was more heavy.
Airbus commanded a study that indicates that a additional pound at the level of the seats would improve the quality of sleep by 53%.
Boeing contests the Airbus numbers as regards the width of the seats and claims that it is not for manufacturers to decide how air companies equilibrate the price of tickets and equipment.
He also states that the study shows that cabin experience does not depend only on the width of the seats.
"It is actually to bring flexibility to air companies and allow them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities well," Kentvoller said, due to the satisfaction of passengers in Boeing.
They don't want to tell them what they can be rental.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers it is more to have a certain freedom of movement, but for the providers it is more than one question that could affect their results.
After the dispute, an aircraft order is hidden for at least $700 Md at the market price in the coming decades, enough to reduce the US and European export balance.
As Reʹs said for the first time in July, the setting of seats is exactly what feeds the battle between all the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing both return one seat in their last models of long-cour bimotors 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The annual performances of Boeing deithe in part of the comparison between the 777X set up with 10 seats per range and a 777 in range 9.
The winning in terms of united costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats by range currently in service.
"Boeing does this to get more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Confort Passager director at the European Airbus Airbus airport.
On the other hand, the analystes say that the cabines configured with 10 seats in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are pronounced for a deeper configuration, which can be paid with less dear tariffs.
"A 18-pound seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from the commercial point, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of 777," said the expert in the cabines of Mary Kirby, the founder and editorial head of the Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't provide seats, but propose a catalog of suppliers among which air companies should choose.
Aeroplane sellers who make the world's tour even carry a meter with them to verify competitive configurations.
While sold to offer comfortable equipment, all manufacturers also offer aeroplanes with strong density configurations to low-cost aircraft and regional travel.
Airbus offers a A350 configured with 10 seats by range but indicates that he has not sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus highlighted the need for a greater personalization of cabines by offering larger seats on some of its planes.
Without the support of the only large builder of modern large apparatus, experts say that it is low to call the air industry in order to establish a standard of size for seats, but that it could forget 777X winning vague.
The Oracle Actionaries irritated by the Salary of Ellison
A majority of operators of Orakle voted on Thursday against the proposal for remuneration for the founder and Director-General Larry Ellison, taking into account the financial performance of its group.
The vote is not compulsory, but it comes to take the picture of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just unrealized of the victory of his ship at the Cope of America.
The billion has still 25% of the capital of the group of software that he has co-funded 40 years ago.
The last year, Ellison had voted a negative vote on his recompense.
The Oracle patron revoked a $1.2 million for the 2013 year closed due to the bad performance of the group, which lacked its growth objectives, but estimated about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is just a symbolic dollar.
At the end of the past 2013 year, the net profit of Oracle increased by 3.5% while the Bourse course was 27.5%, which surfaced S&P-500, which took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure that a cigarette is taken to smoke.
One single dose of the vaccine could protect life from nicotine dependency.
Other tests are needed before testing on human being, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cor _BAR_ Medical College of New York said that the first signs were encouraged.
"We really hope that this type of vaccinal strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop today with all the methods available on the market, but discover that their addiction is sufficient to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cor.
The new vaccine contains an immune virus used to transport the genetic information necessary to design anti-nicotine anticorps.
The virus infects the liver cells selectively, which then begins to produce a regular anticorps flow.
The antibodies trace all nicotine moles presented in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from having his nicotine dose.
During the tests, the vaccinated mouse to which nicotine had been given after normally continued their activity.
But the mouse that did not have been vaccinated " were paused", said researchers, signed that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiences are described in the translational Medical Science.
The vaccines against tobacco have been ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections are repeated so often so that anticorps levels remain high that they were too honest and little practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be very lower because it converts the liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human use vaccine was completely secure, it could be administered to children before they were tried to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more useful than the smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of anti-nicotine vaccine, and that will help them lose their bad habit," he said.
British scientists claimed that the results were interesting but reported that much more detailed research was necessary.
The leader of the Pakistanian Taliban killed by a drone
Hakimullah Mehsud was killed by the leader of the Pakistanians' movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, in a freshly American drone in Pakistan, learned from security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been yearned several times in the past.
But responsible for information, army and activist movement said this time that he had lost life in this battle, led in the North-Wazstan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone three," said a high security responsibility.
The guard, the Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, moved to London, informed the British Government that discussions had been engaged with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the movement of the Pakistanian Taliban.
Tripodi is not affected by Obeid
The former Working Minister of South Joe Tripodi will make an investigation of the State's anti-corruption regulator.
The former Minister of New Galles of South Joe Tripodi refused to have the trade policy on the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three goods in the area controlled by the government.
Wednesday, the Indian Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation to know whether Mr. Obeid had pressed several State ministers to renew his balls in Quay, where Obeids had two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiry in 2005, without a call.
She now examines the claims which Mr. Tripodi was at the core of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, after the witness of the former adjoined Secretary-General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions started in 2005, the Government pressed the balls to make a call for offers.
The sites were opposed and also wanted longer duration.
In 2009, the balls related to Circular Quay firms, which reported to Obeid approximately $2.5 m per year, were renewed without offerings.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister for the Ports of February 2006 in November 2009, was in favour of offer calls.
But he refused to have changed its policy on the request of Mr. Obeid, who, recognized Mr. Tripodi, claimed to change the government policy in the field of balls.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls past in age to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a high officer who had reached the Port Minister after working under M. Obeid's orders in the Ministry of Peace.
"The subject discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of trade policy?" asked Commissioner Anthony Whealy at Mr. Tripodi.
“ No, ” answered Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we were talking about, but in any case, it wasn't that.
In any case, it is certainly not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli war flights target the deal, says a responsible
Israeli war flights reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia Thursday evening, confirming a military responsibility in Fox News.
The responsibility did not define the objective, but said that there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian mixtures SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel led aircrafts against missile loads.
Foreign workers possessing a visa 457 may have a "authenticity test" test
The Government is currently studying the possibility of establishing an authenticity test for foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 while intending to extend the repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would apply a criteria to prevent 457 visuals from being used to occupy non-qualified posts or as a distorted means to make his family and friends come inside.
A Government's work document has been published today while the worker Maxine McKew stated the governmental talk on foreign workers, saying that he could offend the neighbors of Australia.
"The failing statements on "foreigners returning to the end of the row" and "employment for the boarders" are an ungrateful return at the time when the syndicates requested a protected work market," she said to Australia India Institute today.
Historyly, this means that the work of the Blass should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region view it as an echo to this historical artefact.
The work document states that 12 measures had been discussed by the former Imigration Ministry of Chris Bowen.
Brendan O'Connor, minister of Immigration, who was in Sri Lanka to meet higher responsibles to discuss human trafficking, has implemented five of the recommended changes, while others are in examining.
If the "authenticity" criteria was adopted, a visibility applicant could be controlled to know "if the offer of employment is authentic if the candidate is a relationship or a personal association of the owner or the person concerned within the company who sponsors it."
Undertakings may also be required to state the number of visibility holders 457 after some of them, having intention of sponsoring a small number of employees, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old sri-lankais asylum applicant would die from a heart crisis after arrived on a ship transporting asylum applicants to Christmas Island this week.
The deceased son of the man, age 9, was in age with him and found comfort since his father's death Thursday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the Hostel of Christmas, where he was dead.
A study aimed at multiplying the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was held by the British Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd allows to think that high speed services will start up to Scotland and North England from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
The Barone Transport Minister Kramer stated that the project " would raise the United Kingdom".
The Swiss Transport Minister, Keith Brown, said "excited" to work with the British Government on the project.
The phase 1 will be on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When phase 2 is finished, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revealed the estimated cost of the construction of the large-speed connection between London and North England, which was 32.7 Md£ to 42.6 Md£.
The British Government, who is speaking with Transport Scotland, requested HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of travel duration for North England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of traveling between Glasgow and Edimbourg for three hours.
Barone Kramer said: "Our objective for HS2 is a really national network that will draw close to the United Kingdom and its cities."
We move the HS2 project because the benefits he present are great.
Without him, we are confronted with a problem of capacity in our railway network.
But it is also to develop connectivity between the 18 large British cities, including Glasgow and Edimbourg, so that connections between them be better through HS2.
The British State Secretary for Ecosse, Alistair Carmichael, said: "The announcement of today is a good news for Ecosse."
For the Swiss Government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael to "without equivalence" support Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer significant economic benefits to Scotland, but it also offers the economic weight of Scotland in the large-scale railway project throughout the Great Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government in order to examine the options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating a benefit for all and completing the Glasgow-Edimbourg line that the Swiss government is already planning.
“I am unconscious to read the review report with the British Ministers next year, and we will then decide in the next steps. ”
The rules on the use of board electronic devices remain for the entry into force
Australian air passengers will have to continue to extinguish their tablets and smartphones while collecting and landing, despite the United States' gesture, with a view to sustaining the regulation on electronic devices.
The Federal Aviation of America has left the door open to the American carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during the critical flight phases provided that they are in a "plane" mode.
The passengers can already do it during the largest part of the flight, but many people find it dangerous that they can't access their electronic books during collection and landing.
Australian transporters examine the decision that forces American transporters to carry out an important work in order to meet the requirements, but they indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that she examined the announcement but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment during critical flight phases were still in force.
"The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic equipment in a plane," she said.
The issue is subject to a regulation that requires aircraft operators to ensure continuous security and passengers to respect the security checks given by the team members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to the CASA about her intention to expand the use of her board entertainment system using Wi-Fi, was open to a change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a revision of the CASA that would enable the use of electronic devices because we really think that this would improve the client experience now we have (using Wi-Fi) on our aircraft," said a password.
Cantas stated that she respected the current rules for the time.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during collection and landing, and we do not intend to change it immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to American aircraft companies.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will examine closely the decision of the FAA and the reasons for it.
For American transporters, the impact of the decision will vary from one air company to another and will depend on the age of their float.
Transporters will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interferences from electronic devices, as well as revision of manuals, training material, hand-hand baggage transport programmes and passenger consignments.
"When a aircraft has checked the tolerance of its float, it may allow passengers to use phone devices, such as tablets, electronic book readers and smartphones at all heights," said the FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the team will ask passengers to remove their equipment during the landing.
The group also recommended that the heavyest devices be assembled in safety under the seats or in the higher levels during the collection and landing.
Pia: at least four wounds in a violent baggage
The small community of Pia knew an excesion of fibre Thursday evening.
Three gendarmery vehicles, two ambulances and a trip of 30 people.
On that day of Halloween, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia, where a rix that includes a number of people was stuck on the side of the Poste.
At least four vulnerable persons would be deployed.
Alerted, the gendarms went on the place to separate the beliefers and to ensure that the wounds are taken.
Singapore gage loans benefit from the average classs that are limited to cening
In a carrier of the Bendemeer commercial center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga puts a bracelet, a bathroom and a couple of gold ear bottles to pay the school costs of her daughters.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, so my whole money has gone in," says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she wins $3,000 from Singapore (2,400) per month as a administrator, and her husband also works, the monthly family income does not support, says she.
In fact, the request is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where the rental of the households increases – that ValueMax, where it has made its transaction, has become the third loans company to be introduced to the Singapore bourgeois.
To gage babies is not only a rapid means of liquid money – $1 300 from Singapore in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga – but it is almost a good market as the uncertain loans.
Generally, Singapore gage loans have an effective annual interest rate of 17 %, just over 15,4 % offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funding rate with a contribution in the same commercial center.
Nevertheless, the loan loans have the advantage of not requesting solvency or proof of salaries, and they can debloque the loans faster than banks.
Thus, millions of people throughout the region are turning to the loans on the gage, while the families feel the pressure of life costs and overcoming the households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the world financial crisis, and the good market credit feed by a too laxistic monetary policy in the advanced economys, low and medium-income familys turn to the loans in order to complete the difference while their economys know a relaxation.
This week, the Standard & Poor notation agency has cited the growing detention of households, which mainly reduces the increase of hypothiatric loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had finally registered the highest brutal domestic household/product in Asia.
Malaysia comes in a list of 80% of the BDP, while the rate was 60% in 2008.
Economys also fear the high level of consumers in Thailand, which has soon been out of a technical recession this week.
Wednesday, data showed continuous weakness of exports and relaxation of consumers' request.
"The balance is that with the increase in costs, people in the middle or down [of the salary scale] seek to complete their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, economicist in the CIMB, a Malaysia bank.
Historyly high prices of gold during the last two years have made people pressure to carry out their personal effects to touch the value of their bicycles.
In Singapore, approximately 70 per cent of the articles in the 200 loans of the city are in gold.
People say, “The price of the gold is high, put the chain in gold of the grandmother, and it will be returned to search for the next month. ”
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest loan bucket operator, has increased 20% of the number of customers using their boots during the past months.
The growth is such in the loan on gage that ValueMax, bottle operator in Bendemeer and 15 other boots like this in Singapore, intends not only to develop in the neighborhood Malaysia – where he already counts four boots – but also outside Asia, says Ja Lee Ching, his general guide.
The company will finance them by using 60% of the 66 M$ of Singapore that she raised this week during its introduction to the Singapore City.
While some lower rates have been criticized for the exorbiting interest rates they practice, Ms. Yes indicates that the payment offers not only higher rates than the other assets, but also not directly the debt.
"Clients hypothese the goods they already possess, and the fact that they monetate their personal property doesn't affect the deduction of the households," she said.
Increasingly accepted socially as a means of a short-term financing.
Persons who are at the gage levels are not only those who have financial problems.
Easy people in Singapore are also going to the loan buckets on the ValueMax to carry out gold lingotes or Rolex horses, which can represent up to 60% of their purchase price in species.
We see clients from all the beds of the company.
"It may be appealing persons who need to take short-term contributions for business or investment activities, or small enterprises who need treasure to overcome a difficult cap," Mrs. Yes.
Sometimes, they just need money very quickly.
Patient accused of young pornography in New Ecosse
A pastor who cared for young people, in the region of Halifax in New Escocia, is accused of young pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, age 30, was arrested on Friday morning after the conquests to his home and to the National Research Council office.
The baptism church of Timberlay, where the pastor was official, was deeply attracted by this news.
The church responsibles indicate that Mr. Hudgins had dismissed his post.
The shepherd was released under conditions.
It should not, in particular, be able to do with persons less than 18 years old and not access to the Internet.
It will compare in the provinced court in Halifax in December.
He becomes a Nazi uniform at the supermarket before he was cast
A man dressed with a nazi uniform of a brassard with the gamma cross was prayed to leave a supermarket, and customers were complained at the direction of the establishment called the police, indicated the magazine Friday.
"We received several customers' complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a supermarket chain portfolio of Asda.
The magazine called the police to the rescue, but "the time she comes, he's already gone without sclander," she said.
I was doing the cup when I saw a woman that seemed to be ill.
People were boys' mouth.
"You don't go out this way in the street unless you want to attach attention," said a client, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old, in the newspaper Cambri _ News.
This incident occurred Thursday, day of Halloween's festival, where it is usual to get out in monsters, but it was difficult to know if it was a canular.
A man of Cambria revenged the responsibility of this act on his Twitter account, where he placed Adolf Hitler's images.
"I have a black SS brassard twice a week at Asda for three years," Paul Dutton claimed, explaining "mental problems".
Rescue plan of 325 M$ for Tasmania's health system
The Federal Government maintains that the 325 M$ safeguard plan is intended for the vacillant health system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the State government will not deploy funds.
The Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that Commonwealth is currently taking “necessary measures ” to end a crisis caused by the age of the population of the island, the high rate of chronic diseases and the limits of the system.
The funding planned for four years was decided after consultations of the Government with the independent member of Tasmanie, Andrew Wilkie.
"The Government has proposed a plan of emergency salvation that, we, will regulate the unique challenges that the State is confronted," Mrs Plibersek said today.
The plan of 325 M$ includes a campaign of 31 M$ for non-necessary surgery operations.
2 600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopedia and cataracte, will help to recover the delay.
Funds are also scheduled for clinics without meetings in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, medical framework training, mental health services and the development of electronic medical dossier systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are responsible for the idea that, according to the first line clinics, it is the best way to care for Tasmanie's health system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister claimed that the Government of Tasmania would be confronted with a strict system of preparation and reporting.
The State will have to maintain the current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth's money and to prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it costs additional funds.
A committee composed of three persons will be established to ensure that the State provides services in the most effective and efficient way possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 will not be counted for majority "unless they are followed by a real reform that allows the Tasmanian public health system to consolidate".
However, he welcomed the Government for responding to the request for urgent assistance that he had submitted to the Prime Minister on the beginning of May.
"I hope that the Federal Aid Plan will contribute greatly to restore the public health system in Tasmania from the black list," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-necessary procedures will increasingly turn the recent coups.
But Peter Dutton thinks that today's announcement is a "a solution of happiness".
"The reason why we are here is that the State's worker government has recovered $430 from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
It is not possible to have a government of the State that takes almost a half half dollars and the Commonwealth that is $300, and it is a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that no dollars of the salvation plan would be expendited in additional bureaucracy.

The destruction of its capacity to produce chemical weapons, says the monitoring
The destruction of the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas munitions, stated the international monitoring of chemical weapons Thursday, while violent conflicts were injured in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents should be stored.
A group of Syrian soldiers also stated Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the beginning of civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) has arrived with an advanced day on the date of the limit of the
1 November established by the organisation based on the Haye order to destroy or "inutile" all chemical weapons production units and machines intended to mix toxic gases and fill municipalities.
The end of what is mainly the initial destruction phase is an important step of the ambitious calendary to destroy the chemical weapons from this mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of equipment, it will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, the destruction of existing weapons and reservations must still be started.
It is considered that the country has approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemical products and weapons, including motard gas and sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made while fighting was made on Thursday in Safira, which, experts, opened a chemical weapons production unit and storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Great Britain.
The group of soldiers, who followed the development of human balance through a military network based on the human balance, stated Thursday that 120 296 people were dead.
Among them, there are 61 067 civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the side of the Government, 29 954 members of the armed forces of President Bachar el-Assad found death, 18 678 of whom were pro-governmental forces fighters and 187 of the Libyan Hezbollah military soldiers.
Among the dead, it is also considered that 2 202 were dezerters and about 5 375 opposition fighters, many of them were strangers.
On 25 July, the United Nations considered that 100 000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated this number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee from the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad's troops are opposed to rebels, with many of which are linked to Al-Qaida network groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any precision.
The fights highlighted the importance of the dangers to which the chemical weapons inspectors are confronted while they have to purchase their mission, which consists of eliminating its toxic arsenal in the middle of a civil war that will lose, in short-term periods.
A statement of the OIAC, who works closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was “now satisfied with control – and since destroyed – all the critical production and machines intended for mixing and filling”.
It said that “no other inspection activities were planned for the time”.
Before the week, the inspectors said that they had completed the first stage of the checking work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by.
They could not visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, the inspectors indicated.
Thursday, the OIAC said that the two sites were “abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical arms program they contained were moved to other stated sites, which were inspected”.
It was difficult to first know if Safira's unit was one of the two sites that OIAC inspectors could not visit.
It submitted a total destruction plan of its chemical weapons which was approved in the following month by the OIAC Ex-Committee.
"I welcome the moral force and courage you all have shown in the most difficult mission of this organization," said the Director-General of the Organization Ahmet Uzumcu in a comment from the OIAC.
Now in its third year, civil war is mainly opposed to the Muslim rebellion solved to the Government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alautians Section, an islam of the Close.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there was a strong midnight explosion in a air defense base in the Syrian coast province of Latakia.
The cause of explosion remains unknown, he said.
Anger provoked by the penalty pronounced against one of Bali's bombing holders
The surroundings and neighbors of the 202 killed in Bali's attacks in 2002 reacted with anger against the last of the conspirators to be translated into justice, saying that Umar Patek should be furied by a Implementation Bolton.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years of fleeting by being one of the most searched men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to a 20-year prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive engines used in attacks.
It could be released at the end of 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was acknowledged for mass murder for attacks in two night boxes in the popular tourist quarter of Kuta, which caused death of 202 people, including 88 persons, and made many injured.
It was also recognised that many other guilty leaders were guilty of terrorism, including a wake of expectations for churches throughout Indonesia at Christmas Watch in 2000.
The prosecutors asked for perpetuity penalty, however, they could have asked that the man, qualified by "Demolition Man" for his reputation as expert in the production of bombs, would be condemned to death.
The decision took advantage of penitent memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost his two 39-year-old jane and Jenny in the destructions perpetuated by Patek and other conspirators about 10 years ago.
At the border of the tears, she said that Patek had to be condemned to death.
I really think he should have followed the same way as the other men.
"It should be drawn before the Implementing Bottle," Mrs. Corteen said to the AAP.
I have to live every day without other kids, nor see my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb loaded in a furgonet outside was exploded only after 23 hours on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paı's Bar when a camkaze dropped a bush on the back of explosives nearly 20 seconds earlier.
He shot in the coma on the next day of expectation and remained inconscient for a month, and he died three times while he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said that Patek had to know the same sort as the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were exerted 4 years ago.
In fact, this man would have been condemned to death before others.
Keep it alive, why, there is no reason to keep it alive.
During 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and hurt hundreds of others, it's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bomb holders to be translated into justice.
He had been able to avoid capturing himself for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistan town of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the old leader of Al-Qaida, Oussama ben Laden, less than four months later.
A FBI officer said that reports of information services had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to restore links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaida.
"He hasn't gone," Mrs. Corteen said.
Until recently, he was extremely mocked about the pain he could have caused others.
The verdict was delivered to the 10th anniversary guard of the attacks that will be collected later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and inside.
“ This year will be a lot of weeping, ” Mrs. Corteen said.
Patek can, however, call for his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use aircraft Gadgets (but don't get a call with their phone)
Aeroplane passengers will be able to use their portal electronic equipment to read, work, play games, watch films and hear music – but not talking on their mobile phone – according to the newly expected guidelines by the Federal Aviation.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be placed will vary from one air company to another, said the FAA administrator Michael Huerta during a press conference.
The aircraft firms must prove to the FAA that their aircraft respects the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the team members and the rules on the arrangement of equipment to be complied with.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain aircraft companies to expand the use of electronic equipment on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are part of companies who have already submitted plans.
"On the basis of the plan, we could approve an extensive use of electronic devices very closely," stated the FAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers must remove their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the airport are closed.
They are not supposed to light them before the plane reaches a height of 10 000 feet and the commander gives its green fire.
The passengers are supposed to extinguish their devices when the aircraft descends before landing and do not delay them until the aircraft has been placed.
In accordance with the new directives, aircraft companies whose aircrafts are properly protected from electronic interferences may authorise passengers to use their equipment during the collection, attempts and land rolling, stated the FAA.
Most new aircrafts and other aircrafts that have been made to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher levels should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said happily about these changes.
“ Once the new policy is implemented in safety – and we will work closely with transporters for this – it will be beneficial to everyone, ” Glading explained in a statement.
We are sincerely satisfied to feel as “room overseers” in this matter.
But it will always be prohibited to connect to the Internet for surfer, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10 000 feet, said the Agency.
The passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft devices.
So there is still no Words With Friends, the online game Scrabble to which the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was exhausted from a American Airlines Airlines aircraft after being disabled when the camera was guarded at the door.
And the hardest devices like the phone computers will always be broken because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Board phones will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority on mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA can lead to the prohibition on certain electronic devices during collection and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of National Transport Safety Board, national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that phones were always considered as a risk.
"Portable phones are actually a problem, not only because they might be able to create interferences with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disturb mobile phone antennes if they are used on board," Rosenker said.
A industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to examine the problem recommended that the Government authorise more use of personal electronic equipment in the last month.
The heavy pressure on the FAA has increased during the past years to sustain restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator McCaskill, D-Mo., support that there is no security reason for these prohibitions.
Constraints are also more difficult to apply because the use of devices has become all present.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of the passengers forgot to remove their devices or make it deliberately.
The FAA started to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 after reports on the presence of interferences with navigation and communication instruments when passengers transported FM radios, the high-tech gadget.
The new online aircraft has much more electrical systems than aircraft generations, but they are also designed to resist electronic interferences and approved by the FAA.
Air companies have allowed their passengers to use the Wi-Fi for several years in cross-heights.
Aeroplanes to receive Wi-Fi systems are also better responsible for interferences.
The large majority of online aircrafts should allow the use of electronic devices in accordance with the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally issue radio transmissions much lower than equipment generations.
Electronic book readers, for example, only issue minimum transmissions when a page turns.
But transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those who pressure for a mixture of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders loaded an electronic book reader aircraft and made it stealing to see if there were problems, but there was no one.
This has inspired the members of the FAA Advisory Committee of misguided feelings regarding whether the use of devices is a risk.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Security of Airline Passengers, said he thought that the interferences from the devices were real, even if the risk was minimum.
Other members of the Committee stated that there are only anecdotic reports of pilots that indicate that devices can interfere with a plane system, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA authorise the drivers to ask passengers to remove their equipment during accession to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of travel industry welcomed changes, calling them for full-detailed arrangements for travellers equipped.
"We are happy that the FAA is that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and director of the United States Travel.
A heliterated bird of a North Sea platform has been released in nature
A bird, heliterated after having been found on a oil platform in the North Sea, was released in nature.
A helicopter in direction of Aberdeen was made up the water rail on the board in the last month before it was released by the Swiss SPCA in its Alloa salvation center.
The central director Colin Seddon said: "This water rail was probably a winter-free spectator coming from northern Europe and found himself in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea."
It is that the epulated bird would have succeeded to find refuge on the oil platform.
He said: “It was impossible to flight again, so we were contacted to bring our aid.”
The water rail was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to make business with Great Britain?
The Business campaign for Britain was held in April with the promise to meet companies and to define what the creators of wealth and employment want to change in our relationship with the EU.
To do so, we commanded the widest and fullest investigation to the British business leaders and asked them what they thought about Great Britain, companies and the EU.
YouGov asked more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representatives of all companies, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The conclusions of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have discovered that the large majority of companies are currently trying to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that modernize and develop while EU States stand up.
They want to see the Government to give the priority to new trade connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to align themselves into the long and heavy process of reform of European institutional arcanes.
When they are asked of their opinion on specific political points – from the regulation of monopolies to products laws – most of the business leaders think that the control of these key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The unique market has provided a general disproportion, saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportioned in relation to the benefits of the European trade area – 40% of the larger companies, traditionally the most pro-European, are even agreed.
Finally, and what is more speaking, our investigation with the business leaders revealed that a major majority would like to see Great Britain to continue initiatives for a change in the Treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and non-policy.
This conclusion, which is located in all large groups and enterprises of all sizes, shows that the world of the company insists on a "significant change" that renews power in the United Kingdom.
Injuries are high – to change the Treaty and to better represent the interests of Great Britain would allow 16% of the votes for the maintenance of the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not do one instance: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to negotiate the terms of Great Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that enterprises hope that renegociation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, more and more necessary, to better represent the interests of the British enterprises, since the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be the employment and growth in Great Britain, and, as the conclusions of our investigation show it, this means re-inserting trade and a change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
United States of Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the tradition of Halloween.
With his wife last night, he distributed frindises to hundreds of children invited in the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween's festivals on the coast were cancelled from the United States because of the crossing of the Sandy Uragan.
This year, the festivals were therefore lost.
In New York, thousands of costume people participated in the parade organized in the "Greenwich village" quarter.

Halloween is a pagan festival at the Watchtower of the Toussaint, mainly in the Anglosaxons countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom says that the gasoduc of Bulgaria is a new era of gas
The beginning of the construction of South Stream Gasoduc in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said Gazprom director.
“An historical event has occurred today: The construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gasoduc, the largest European project,” explained Alexei Miller, the Gazprom General Director, in a Thursday statement.
This project is a key element of energy security of the European continent.
South Stream should be allowed to diversify Russian export paths to Europe.
A contractual difference between Gazprom and Ukraine's approved country, through which the largest part of Russian gas intended for Europe, increases the risk level compared to conventional roads, the director.
Miller said that the direct association to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream Gas to a reduced tariff as soon as the project is in force in 2015.
Gazprom pointed out that the construction should be started in other countries under this year at the end of the year.
The gasoduc was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubes of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The Pitcairn Island wants to create the largest marine reservation in the world, announced Thursday the News of Tahiti, representing a radio information.
This is the last British territory of the South African is, at the east of the French Polynesia archipel, at the middleway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2 if there are three other small nearby islands.
He is British since his occupation in 1790 by the Mutiners of the Bounty, episode of the history of the English marine, which has made place to three Hollywood adaptations.
Some decades of residents, most of the Mutinist descendants of Bounty, are still living in Pitcairn, and their income is 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the Iceland voted for the establishment of a marine reservation around the small pile, or 836.000 km2 corresponding to its economic area.
A assistant of the Major of the island went to London to ask the Great Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Master of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the Governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand and the British Government.
The creation of such marine reservation would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836.000 km2, however, to have the means to ensure that it is monitored, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircrafts dedicated to the supervision of the area, and there is no port to place military supervisory vessels.
As regards France, it must already carry out the very precious air and sea monitoring of five million km2 from the French Polynesia ZEE, neighbor of Pitcairn.

Living prison for an ancient Chinese governor
An ancient governor of the province of Jilin, in the north-east of China, was condemned on Friday to the prison for corruption.
Excluded by the party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million yuan of potter-de-vine, reporting the Chinese official media.
Since 1995 to 2001, the Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, assisted companies and responsible for contracts, loans or promotions in exchange of money or gifts, stated the first intermediate court of Pekin on his microblog.
President Xi Jin, who took his functions last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, estimating that the phenomena was a threat to the existence of the Partie.
If the leader of the State promised that justice would be intra-idible with the powerful "tigres" as with the "bottles" - subalternal officers - only a pound of high-range responsibles were condemned, among whom ancient oil geant oil.
The recently spectacular case was the old leader of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was condemned to live in September for corruption and abuse of power after having mentioned the highest functions in the State.
However, the Government has no longer demonstrated the intention of reforming the system of fight against corruption by creating, for example, an independent agency from the party.
Two employees of the YMCA accused of sexual agressions after claims against Jonathan Lord, during an audience of the Royal Commission.
Two employees from the YMCA of New Guiléad of South were accused of sexual attacks against children following claims against the Caringbah Educator, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, during an audience of the Royal Commission of Sexual Abuses on Children.
However, in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that “he had never had to face a problem of sexual agression on children within his organization”.
Director-General Phillip Hare was asked about two cases: A YMCA employee was accused of infringements relating to child pornography and an educational monitor of YMCA Caringbah Hall was recognized for sexual attacks on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare said to Gail Furness, a lawyer advocate to the Commission, that he had known the first case but that he was not at the court of the second.
He also admitted that the opening statement of YMCA was inexacte, underlineing, "YMCA's external controls were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was a absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that he had received the seconds of the worst appreciation for four institutions in the review of the quality of the Department of Education and Communities performed in this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working in the YMCA at 21 years of age, admitted that the management of the staff was a mistake with the Lord's recruitment and that he had forgotten to verify that the employees were obliged to report any violation of the children's security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was condemned for sexual agressions on twelve boys during the two years when he worked at YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years of prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing the staff from reporting the Lord's failures to the safety of children.
The staff witnessed that they had noticed some mistakes, especially the fact that Lord stayed alone with the children, that he kept them in private, put them down on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who had been instructed by Lord and who had asked for a training for the protection of children because she was concerned about her behavior, said that she was the responsible for the children of YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who would include Lord “very intimidant and difficult to approach most of the time”.
The Director-General said that he rejected the witnesses of the staff which they were resisting the idea of reporting these failures to their superior hierarchy.
Instead, he said that their friendly relationships with the Lord have distorted their judgment, so that they have not reported his actions.
Mr. Hare said that he had expressed his view in front of the Council of the YMCA of New Galles of the South, saying that for the organization, the lesson of the "Incidence Jonathan Lord" should not concern "the signal" by the staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the staff of confidentiality agreements, soon after the claims were stated, was taken by the Director-General of YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence elements but that it was a "excesion of zeal" and that it had been wrongly implemented.
The YMCA of New Galles of South was not a safe organization for children when Jonathan Lord was employed there, which was between 2009 and 2011, stated the expert on sexual violence on children, Professor Stephen ALLBON of the Griffith University before the Commission.
It indicated that there were "severe problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision.
The audience has been updated until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return to Prime Minister, but he recognizes that his return is little.
In an interview last night on the fifth anniversary of its department at the end of its mandate, 59-year-old man informed his opinion on various national policies.
Since its release in June 2007, after a decade to the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing the British Policy, limiting its comments to foreign matters and its special sending role in Quatuor for the peace process in the Middle East.

When many equest manifestations experts meet in Cardiff to face and get the roof of the Year's Horse, they say that competition would be brutal.
But no one was going to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child.
Not yet in the olive and only a few months after having made his first weapons, the whole-small and his pony Shetland Toffee were thrown during the three tours with a great facility and received the first price, leaving the 30 other adult competitors behind them.
The two inseparable – which are the same size – were welcomed for the presentation, attitude and attitude during the annual concurrence that was developed in the Sunnybank Equester center in Rudry near Cardiff.
By presenting himself against men and women in legacy melon heads, he was carrying his plate casquet a little on the side in distracted way to screw his pony Toffee two years of age around the track.
Fenton was welcomed by the judges for his uncommon natural quality of dressing for a child of her age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee in gift for his third birthday in March last and trained from his Shetland pony every day.
His 30 - year - old mother Donna said: “Fenton and Toffee are doing an excellent two. ”
They presented themselves towards and against all, but they both broke the goal and the roset.
It was just the second time he covered with Toffee and we were crazy of joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenonal that they wanted to make a photographer with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, south of the country of Galles, follows the tracks of his tante Sharon Howells, who has participated in ecster concurrences for over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said, "There was election in the air, and everyone encouraged and applauded it."
He parked all the length of the track by running and even if it seemed to be too small, he did a wonderful work.
Fenton is a fool of animals – he loves the horses, tractors and the rural world and has two pockets that he cares.
In the way he started, he will soon participate in the manifestation of the Year's Horse – and I am sure he will make a beautiful performance.
A port-word of the annual equester manifestation said: "Fenton has only three years but he knows how to conduct his pony."
They form a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee had a good presentation and the way they shot on the track.
They are looking for an effective team work between the pony and the poker – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud to go.
A Chinese journal that launched a call "will be refunded"
A Chinese journal that launched a call on the first page for the release of a journalist accused of diffamation will be repealed, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou has made a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen finally admitted the television that he had accepted potters of vine to make stories about a half-public society.
Now the New Express will be a "complete relief", said the regulator.
The order of "reservation" of the Guangdon Press and Edition Administration, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had made several wrong articles on the Zoomlion company between September 2012 and 2013.
“ New Express's editing was deceived, ” said the regulator in a statement.
He said that he had decided to impose a administrative sanction in Chen Yongzhou by returning his press card.
He also “ordained to the Yangcheng Evening News group to take a complete review of New Express, and recommended that he carry out an investigation on the persons responsible for New Express and direct the newspaper team immediately. ”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the financial irregularities assumed by a Chantier Engineer Manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper doubled a first page call for his release, writeing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a television chain where he admitted that he had made false stories against money.
"In this case, I'm naked in Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said on the public television network CCTV.
I did it primarily because I cared for money and clebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's excuses, New Express's excuses on the first page, writeing that he did not verify his articles correctly.
Many important suspicioners have recently made television affairs.
The specialists say that people are systematicly forced to make their neighbors, despite a change in the law which has been voted earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities to force anyone to make it.
Charles-de-Gaulle airport in "indisponibility"
In Toulon, the airport is running.
The fleeting of radioactive vapor detected on one of the two nuclear chauffions of Charles-de-Gaulle, mid-October, and while the ship was in the sea, was "no danger for the sea", but it was no consequence for the Marine.
The Royale has actually confirmed us "the insufficiency" of the ship until "the midnight", "the time to take the correct measures imposed on the reaction.
On its hand, the DCNS company, a defence vessel specialist, ensures that its teams and Areva teams, moved to Var for the occasion, "involving the airport now".
It is for them, inter alia, to change a pump on the disadvantaged chauffion.
"All is implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned development at the end of 2013," explains DCNS.
And the National Marine to certifie that "it does not cause the ship's activity programme" to nuclear propulsion.
Remember that Charles-de-Gaulle airports come from an intermediate period of six months.
He had been from Toulon to mid October for a training.
This is, in particular, in order to qualify young jail pilots.
A "small afarian", circumcised in the area of the reaction, then occurred on the amiral ship of the French float.
According to the National Marine, the team was not exposed to any possible radioactive contamination.
Since more than one year, I am at the same time to find a strong disadvantage from the people I meet: a monstrous revaluation of their properties, tax dilution, the cost of all kinds of allowances, administrative costs to be completed.
Shortly, unlimited syphonization of our pockets.
Millions of dilapided dollars could be spared to allow a very respectful taxation of those paying.
Each money removed from force to contributors reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their advancement.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major enterprises, we are not concerned about the sumptuary expenditure and maintenance of boots: deficit cultural centre, strong subvention to the City of Energy, etc.
If these installations are not rentable, they are sold to the private company or demolitated.
It is also worth finding the expropriation of several properties in order to gain a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable reference to the transformation of ancient Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but what cost for tax payers?
It is not the public pairs to invest in such companies, but also the private sector based on consumer request.
The citizens were happy to learn that the Lakes in the Passover and the Piles will continue to provide the city in potable water.
Following all industry (great water consumers) and the population's great decline, water use has been considered to be decreased everywhere in the territory.
Unless you want to say to get it, the city will never miss water and the severe regulation about its use might be very adjudicated.
In summary, it is very easy to do great things with the money of others.
I'd be shameful to defend such a balance.
With a brutal debt of more than $200 million, this city is not even more able to buy a lobby without a loan regulation.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by cravats with beautiful diplomas for most of us and I don't think that a floor of sheep makes worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical railway systems, was covered.
The American authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagant on an equivalent length of approximately six long football areas, relates to the posts near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, to the United States.
The area resorts to undefined deposits, which allows easily to dissimulate drug loaded trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs were resurrected by inassessing, the authorities said.
The authorities took 8.5 tonnes of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the covering of the tunnel, Judges.
Three men who, the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of ownership of marijuana and cocaine with intention of sale.
They commit a prison penalty from 10 years to perpetuity prison if they are condemned.
In Nogales, Arianna, trafiquants exploit large subterranean draining channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage covered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after marijuana collection in the center of October of Mexico, and thus put a challenge for drug cartridges that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passenger of approximately 700 yards equipped with iron roads that left from the kitchen of a Tijuana house and went up to two posts of San Diego.
The British police delivers an extradition mandate against Assange
The British police has now issued an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who repeated to the Equator's Ambassade in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "reference opinion" against Australia for 40 years, requesting her to be presented to a police committee, saying that if he did not, it would be possible to be arrested.
Assange could be extracted to Sweden according to sexual crime claims, after exhausting all possible ways under the British law after the Supreme Court has invalidated the call that he has prohibited against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
When Stockholm allows his transfer to the United States, he found refuge in the Equator Ambassade in London on 19 June, requesting the South America country of the political asylum.
Scotland Yard “slipped a statement against a 40-year-old man who asked him to present himself to a police committee at the date and time of his choice,” said a password.
It continues to violate the conditions of its freedom under caution.
The Ambassade commented on the release of the opinion by the police.
Assange fears to be extracted from Sweden to the United States where it could be accused of spinner, after devoting more than 250 000 American diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site fighting secret information.
How the biometric has overcome our lives
Finish the passwords to crash to access your smartphone or pay your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers foretell us a future where we will be recognized by the biometrical sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, assistant Director-General of Morpho, even considers "the century will be biometrical".
Only biometric will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a transnational and transnational universe as well as the Internet .
Organizations dedicated to the protection of private life confirm this commitment for biometric, but they are concerned about it.
Nothing but in 2011 and France, the National Information and Freedom Commission authorized 774 printing systems, the form of hand or the hand-free network in companies, administrations, cantines...
"All worlds can soon be identified, anywhere or when," Justin Brookman, responsible for the private life of consumers in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among each other, and pessimism, among others?
Biometric will be based on new techniques that will allow new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometrical data are digital prints, hand-contorning and the old-handed network of the powder or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its limitations.
"For example, some people who work the beton have very broken fingers and their prints are unstable," Philippe Robin, the technical director of the identity area in Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection and the verification of the enemy network and the border of the hand provides a voluntary and precise management of people.
It is at the same time a security - it is not possible to catch these data at their own - and an inconvenience: sometimes the procedure must be repeated and therefore take time.
Therefore, research has been conducted since 20 years on other approaches, such as face or iris (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the precision of sensors and the calculation capacity of computers necessary for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of the face has been multiplied by ten in the last five years, calculating Cyrille Bataller, the Accenture laboratory director in Europe.
With our aid, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have developed automatic border posts using face-up.
Now it is possible to identify a face or iris in movement.
"Aauourd today, we are conducting research on the voiceability or the way to walk with sound sensors, but a quiet environment is needed," says Sridhar Iyengar, director of the Security Research in Intel Labs.
Single and infalsifiable marker, DNA also produces hopes and anxieties.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the last biometrical data," confirms So ́e Vulliet-Tavernier, a guide for study, innovation and prospective to the CNIL.
But the DNA analysis is still very long and very costly.
NEC proposes to the legal police services a cost of EUR 90,000 to analyze DNA samples on the place of crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometers are divided into two groups: identification (rekening one of others) and authentication (assuring that the person is the person which she intends to be).
The identification was too concerned with the delivery of identity papers: the biometrical elements (prints, photos, iris) must be confronted with the information that the State has on all citizens already made.
This allows us to make sure that someone doesn't try to use the identity of someone else.
This comparison principle may have other applications.
Hence, NEC proposes the VIP ability to enter a hotel or store.
"We recover the pictures of the monitoring cameras and comparisons with the photos of the collections freely on the Internet," says Dany Nassif, loaded, at NEC France, of commercial development for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: Take a picture of a cedam that makes the chew in a magazine, follow its progression through the face and calculate the time of waiting.
Authentication included income access (borders, protected locations, cantines...) or logicals (opening a holder).
There was, more recently, the presence control.
"A biometrical pointer avoids the phénomène of the friend who points to another," justifies Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
In addition, the authentication will also affect transactions, especially those carried out from internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to recover money to some distributors by introducing his card and putting his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the hit of the secret code.
A similar technology is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the Natural Security Society in partnership with large distribution banks and teachers: at the time of paying in store with his cart, the customer does not touch his code, but introduces his finger into a player scanning the vineyards.
Experience is intended for six months.
If it is concluded, biometric readers could soon arrive in the French traders.
Tracks to ensure users
There are three ways to make the biometric seduction in the eyes of the great public.
The first is to explain that she can win time.
"If, thanks to the biometric, a client remains in box 30 seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large surface.
The second is to offer custom services: in a few years a voice server can recognize your voice and offer you options to measure.
And finally, reassuring by putting forward the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"Numberal prints are stored on a first server; people's identities are in a second basis: Correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which blocks if we try to move it," Philip Robin, of Thales.
However, in deep studies, it is impossible to know whether these talks really convince users.
Specialists for the Protection of Private Life continue to be concerned.
"The progress of the face-aspect, the multiplication of the monitoring cameras and the large amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, makes me afraid of the worst: a generalized monitoring," Andrew Patrick, of the Commissioner for the protection of private life in Canada.
A round driver at 210 km/h with a warm drink between the feet seemed to inflige an amand of 1 000 £
A carrier seemed to be involved in a 1 000 £ amende for rolling at 210 km/h with a warm drink in balance between his feet.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, of Tiptree in Essex, was found leading his Mercedes Benz on the A120 height of Braintree on 27 May.
When the police arrested him, they covered the drink to carry out his feet.
In the Court of First Instance of Colchester, Howie admitted the infringement of conduct without the needed opinion and attention.
The seven points returned on its authorisation led to a 6-month license retirement.
Howie was also condemned to pay costs of 90 £ and a surprise for a victim of 100 £.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to make London's bull
The Treasur temporarily encrypted the measurement of the tax on capital profits but expected a definitive decision of Mr. Osborne, which, in the 2012 budget, included a 7% timber right for the cost of more than 2 million and annual costs for purchasers who choose to hold properties in the framework of a company instead of individually.
The timber right is already applicable to the residential properties of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents 708 M £ on the financial year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of North Ireland, Galles, Scotland, North-East, North-West and Yorkshire region gathered.
Mr. Cook said: "As followed of the timber right on high value properties and the introduction of the anti-eviting law in the matter, it is very difficult to advance that high-value properties are subject to the effects of the obsolete habitation tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors resisting the idea of buying properties in London or the current owners who have the idea of selling," he said.
The prestigious carrier – 5 to 10% of the highest prices of the real estate market – in the promoted sector southern-west of London, from Fulham in Wimbledon, increased by 11,8% in the past year.
The prices in the center of London show a regular growth in the year of 5.6%, but they have been played by a full growth internal market, the southwest of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a renewal, the Savills studies.
Scientists have lighted the way the movements of a dog's kids are linked to his humor.
Several studies have shown that happi dogs have increased their wheat to the right (of the dog's view), while the nervous dogs have moved it to the left.
But now the scientists say that dogs can detect these subtiles and answer them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscient at the University of Trenth, said: "All know that by humans, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in stimulating positive or negative emotions."
Here we tried to see what he was with other species.
He said that as with man, at dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for moving to the left and versa, and that both hemisphers played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how the dogs react to the movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching films where other dogs contained.
They measured the heart frequency of animals and analysed their behavior.
It will certainly not be necessary for a long time before we realize why their kitchen goes sometimes from one side and sometimes from the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We have presented to dogs of films where other dogs contained – whether a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion factor – and we have been able to trace the movement of the cow and present it as more to the left or to the right."
When animals have seen a dog without expression switching the cup to the right (with the view of the dog that removes the cup), they have remained perfectly devastated.
But when they discovered a cup mainly to the left (once from the dog's point of view that removes the cup), their heart frequency accelerated and they had anxious air.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think that dogs were determined by these movements.
Instead, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not be concerned.
He said: “If you meet several times other dogs and if you note that, most of the time, the movement of their chewing towards one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will respond according to this experience. ”
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and farmers to better learn their animal emotions.
John Bradshaw, professor invited to the University of Veterinary Sciences at Bristol, explained that this was not the first study to consider the importance of the left and right of the dog.
Last year, a team at Lincoln's university discovered that the dogs were turning their head to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when he was a joyful dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “The dogs went easier to a robot dog when his chew moved to the left rather than to the right, rather than to become anxious – the opposite of what is in the Italian study. ”
He pointed out that the differences could come from the fact that dogs who participated in different studies did not entirely consider film animals or dogs robots as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to true dogs could be useful, explained it.
"Although many elements, listed in different mammifers, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details must still be specified – and dogs do not make exception," he said.
However, because of the facility with which their behavior can be stored, it will certainly not be necessary for a long time before we realize why their chew moves sometimes from one side and sometimes from the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert to Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group reported a concert in Glasgow after a laryngite was made to his song.
Sheffield's group had to be held on Friday in The Hydro Concert Room in the city center.
However, the laryngite forced the song Alex Turner to reprogram the spectacle.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to report a concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham Thursday.
In a statement on their official site, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Soon the decision to report the concert to the LG Arena de Birmingham tonight and after requesting a medical opinion, the Arctic Monkeys must also report the spectacle to the Glasgow Hydro on Wednesday 1 November."
“ Alex Turner suffers from a laryngite and regrets not to be able to happen in concert. ”
The LG Arena of Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the Glasgow Hydro will be held on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all the banknote holders for any disagreement caused.
Thank you for contacting the client service at the ticket where you bought your tickets for any additional help.
Papa François will number his first cardinals in February
Papa François will number new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest church men placed in the Catholic Church behind the Pope, and those who elect it, so France will name his first group of men who will finally choose his follower.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, since a cardinal reaches 80 years of age, it can no longer participate in the choice of a papa – so it returns to a group of 120 "electors cardinals".
In an announcement of the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican password, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremonie during which biscuits would be higher than the dignity of cardinal, known under the name of consistency.
"Papa François decided to make his decision to call for the fev consistency in progress to facilitate the planning of other meetings needed to participate in the cardinals of various parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero des Catholic Voices stated that from here February, the number of electors will probably have decreased.
He said that a papa generally named cardinals so much that it needed to reach 120 electoral cardinals and the number of cardinals more than 80 years of age as he wanted.
The composition of the next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope François in March this year, said Valero.
For this time, there is a kind of tendency to privilege Europe, particularly Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new dad will name cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
40% of the Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François has formulated the cardinal advice, a group of eight cardinals worldwide loaded to examine the ways to reform the church.
Earlier, the dad decided everything alone.
"François now has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He said that he was "too possible" that François requested advice to cardinales.
But we have never known such a situation – it's totally new.
Valero pointed out that the papes Elela in general were representatives of large communities in the cardinal range, but that François was “full of surprises – so we don't know who he will name. ”
GM reminds some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seat dossier
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19 000 of its new chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to solve a problem with the handful records, a Wednesday statement of the American statement loaded by the vehicle safety regulation.
On some pickups, seats before presenting a failure at the level of the inclination mechanism.
The documents therefore do not comply with the federal vehicle safety standards relating to head-up.
"If the vehicle is affected by the back, the heading may not protect passengers correctly, thus increase the risk of hurt," the statement shown on the National Highway Traffic Safety Safetyation (NHTSA).
Remindered models were built between 1st to 10 September.
The spread of the GM pickups began in June and represented the most important vehicle launching for the first American car manufacturer since its failure and revolution in 2009.
GM informed the pickup owners of the defect during the first 15 October.
NHTSA could not examine the information letter to the owners due to the 16-day delay of government activities, which has made the growth of vehicle winning in October.
The Pickups of Silverado and Sierra, which were resigned for the 2014 model, increased by approximately 20 % during the first 10 months of the year, said GM Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 pickups Silverado and 16 503 pickups Sierra.
The GM action course was 1.4% to reach $37.47 at New York's breakfast afternoon.
A worker dies buried under beton blocks
A construction worker was dead in the buried place under tens of beton blocks, Thursday before midnight, in Montreal.
The drama occurred at 11:00, on the Marquette Street, near the Beaubien Street intersection, in the Roosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
According to any probability, jobs on the foundations were running to this place for a certain time.
A Mitoyen foundation wall had just been raised in the last days.
It happened at the time the victim had just arrived on the cantier to recover its tools.
I passed in a car and saw the wall rolling with a big smoke cloud, said Sylvain Jean, who stays near the cantor.
I've been shiping and I've gone to remove the big brakes that would get it.
We saw just a part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is a fifty-year-old man who worked for a co-interview undertaking.
Reanimation manuals have been tried by emergency services, but without success.
The man hasn't survived his serious wounds.
An inspector of the Committee on Health and Work Safety has been moved on the sites to investigate the circumstances around this drama.
The call to discover an Obama elector
I voted twice for President Obama, believeing in the possibility of a change
It says that Obama has made praiseful efforts enjoyed by the Obstructionnism of the Republican Party
Obamacare site's difficulties and drones attacks are not excused by obstructionnism
The memory of the 2008 campaign of Obama is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying in the second year of medical study at the Harvard Medical Faculty.
I'm reading a deeply trist book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morocy of the second year of medical health and renew me from hope.
It is called The Audacity to Win and it is memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.
When I finished my patients' medical accounts tonight and I slept, this book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and talks that could cut you up.
The election was completed by an enormous victory and the presentors of the newspapers took time to think about the historical nature of the time.
My friends wept with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries went on to the White House and the nation was ready to change.
○ the transition period of Obama before its employment in 2008, he had 82% of favourable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Return to the present is a difficult wake up, it's like a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, such as remote memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change has really occurred in the years that followed the first time I voted.
That was nothing to do with what I imagined.
I put the credit of Obama of great achievements since the Affordable Care Act (law on abordable care) to our army from Iraq, guarding at the end of the "no seen nor known" and the Oussama Ben Laden's "Oussama Ben Laden".
In addition, I believe that the partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to make our nation progress in immigration reforms, public health care and closed Guantanamo, among other things.
But after I have been able to defend Obama's administration against my couples and my mates, I can't make any explanations anymore.
I am at the border of the political despair.
Republic obstruction cannot explain the hearing of foreign leaders or the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the Private Life of Americans or the implementation of the denunciators that reveal the government's mistakes.
It cannot justifie the statement of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without proceedings, or the elimination of public funding and the expenditures authorised during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justifie the conclusions of a report that states that the efforts of the White House to reduce silence media are "the most aggressive... since Nixon's administration".
And, more recently, she cannot excuse the impossibleity of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Law on the Affordable Care Act has been executed.
I don't know if that's what I'd do.
If at 18 years of age, I was supposed to understand that government could oppose the political campaigns that were before it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not pre-evaluated, because the political party of opposition and events that occur, such as the newton massacre, affect our conversation.
However, all of the examples I have mentioned above are largely the choice of administration.
That's what's the most damage to me.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthusiased by his candidature.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that seemed not to allow its policy or positions to determine.
I felt that Obama, chosen for a second mandate by being released from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that we had heard for so long.
However, while favorable opinions have been under 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me want the many promises that have been fulfilled.
This week, I read the part of the book which described how Obama has lost great losses to the first of Pennsylvania from Clinton.
At a meeting of a post-campagne, he told his team that they should go on the right way and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to renew ourselves on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are five years later, Mr President, and I do not agree with you anymore.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Wednesday, about 15 hours, a violence between a motor and a car occurred a street from Retinne to Fléron.
The motor, Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fléron, had no cask.
Despite the rapid intervention of secures, it has been decided during this frontal settlement.
Clive Palmer predicts that Mr Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental conge system.
Mr. Clive Palmer, Mr. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, has a conflict of interest in the parental conge system because his daughters could be zealous and benefited from this system.
The magnitude of the miner extraction, which contests the payment of a carbon tax of a amount of $6 M, made this argument valuable to try to separate issues about a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four voices in the Senate, which could be crucial at the time of determining whether carbon and miner taxes should be deleted.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr. Abbott's girls were ready to benefit personally from these policies.
"It will have an important conflict of interest when it is going to pay the parental debt because if one of his girls is deceived, it will have a direct interest in the fact that it gets or not a conjunction," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral committee officially stated that Mr. Palmer received the Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes after computing.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a management of the depouring system of supplies to accelerate the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote has been completed?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates in a holder, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper crayons to mark voting bulletins.
Is it possible for the result if someone doesn't agree?
Today, you have a extraordinary paper crayon.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possible options for the electronic vote and has recently conducted a review document with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59 years old, said that his political project included a international airport for Sunshine Coast and that he would take its new functions very seriously.
The exercise of functions is an issue of public service.
"We are not looking for re-evolution, except the story's repeat because we have to serve the community at a critical moment," he said.
A team of biologists managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of dauphin boss at the northern coasts of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, charged by scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Milieux Marins (OCEAMM) returns to the Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Do you surprise the discovery of this new kind of dauphin to boss?
It's a good news, but it doesn't surprise me especially.
If in the past, the species have been described and identified on the basis of morphological, anatomic and geographical, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in sciences of the classification of species.
Moreover, these genetic and molecular biological progress are not possible to reduce the classification or belongance of a species of a genetic, family or even a order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals on the basis of morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are reported in question because of genetic progress.
Similarly, two very close morphologically species were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
A few years ago, the scientific community had two species belonging to this sub-family: the dauphins of the chair and the box of the Atlantic.
Recent analysis allowed four species to distinguish.
Why is this an important coverage as said by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a view of conservation, it is essential to know these genetic differences to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population has already been known by researchers for a long time, they do not know that it is part of a new species, only present at this place.
Thus, if a massive mortality problem caused by a virus epidemic or accidental capture is placed in the region, we could have an issue of extinction of a species, rather than of a local disappearance of a population of a widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more difficult.
A species is considered threatened or extinguished depending on the number of existing individuals on Earth, namely the stock, and the possibility of restoration from neighborhood stocks.
For the species Subsa chinensis, whose population of the new covered species is expired, its stock has automatically become lower, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammifers?
Marine mammifers are set up above the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, where there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This brassing of genes limits the creation of new species.
In contrast, the more closed ecochems promote genetic isolation, which can result in the creation of new species.
We need to know that the marine environment is the least known environment.
It is preferred to send robots on Mars than to know what lives in the Marians' village, only 11 km from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent in the search for life on other planets than in marine research and it's great time than it changes.
RBS suspends two trades on the change market
Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders of his market division of changes; two sources close to the dossier, which shows that the global investigation of the regulators on the suspicions of the market of devises begins to bring its fruit.
Some of the biggest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they would cooperate with regulators in the world's most important financial market investigations, where 5,3 billion dollars change each day.
The two traders are the first employees of the RBS to be suspended in the context of the extension of the investigation that makes it possible to scandale the interbancation of Libor Interbank rate manipulation.
The bank, who commented on the suspension, confirmed that this month has received information requests from the regulators.
"The current investigation on this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and the other regulators," said a representative of the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, nearly sources of the document stated that RBS had transmitted instaured mail and messages, sent to and by an old trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trade, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from its European trade responsibility to the account for the deviations at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, responsible for counterparty exchange trading in Citi, has been made in conjunction this week, while Matt Gardiner, an older deputy trade in Barclays and UBS, has been suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders did any objection.
Mr. Usher's document included instaured messages sent to and by bans working at Barclays and Citigroup, which have been acquired of nearly sources of the dossier.
UBS explained this week that she had intended to take action against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said that he asked for suspicions of market manipulation of changes in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the American Justice Department and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – examine the claims made on bans that would be heard to manipulate the change market rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, indicated nearly sources of the document.
The banks have exposed inconsistent messages and emails sent for years to find cases of repeated acts.
The news on these investigations has made tradings in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of investment bank trading units in the past years, but which has been reported this year because of the low volatility of depenses that limit the opportunities for speculators.
Some banks have tried to minimize the case, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the large market of strongly liquid changes, but the elderly traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader stated that despite the high volume of daily change transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trade management platforms and the use of more frequently by the banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to begin to have an impact on the low cost market".
The news arrived on the same day the Swiss credit announced that he had sent a trading in his office for the negotiated funds the London Bourse this week after he had caused a loss of $6 in the last year.
The bank has quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
"We are convinced that the trade has acted alone and that the case has been controlled," said a representative of the Swiss credit.
The investigation on Major Rob Ford has been bacled, supports a lawyer
After the police confirmed that he had put his hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Me ́yton Ruby had never seen a "so basketed" investigation.
Ruby told me to believe in the Canadian press that the police had "ignored or minimised" evidence elements against the major.
This Thursday, the police arrested the friend and occasional driver of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, 35 years old, and accused him of extortion relative to the video.
Alexander Lisi, accused of drug traffic, was often contacted with the master.
The police also said that he had observed this man who delivered cups in Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Ruby qualified me for "inexplicable" the fact that the police had never shot the Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or listened to his phone, supporting that the police officer Bill Blair chose to know why not act against the master.
In accordance with the law, the police, having been witness to suspicioned transactions in their own hands, would have been very well able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, stop the master, and make a perquisition - even without mandate.
It would also have been able to request an inconsistent procurement mandate, if necessary.
The police leader did not comment, but his password Mark Pugash qualified Me Ruby's words of "obvious and desperate temptation" to take place with media in a case that doesn't matter anyway.
In conference of press, Wednesday, Mr. Blair claimed that there was nothing in this video that could be " reasonable motives" that could lead to the depth of a major's depth.
The European Bourses on Mid-Sentation, except London
Except London, the main European Bourses are developing on Wednesday at mid-site, played by some news of deceiving companies, while Wall-Street is expected to grow.
Furthermore, investors remain lasting because they believe that the United States Federal Reserve could reduce its quantity sustainment policy as soon as intended.
In contrast, after an inflation announced by 0.7% for the euro area, the idea is spread among the market shareholders that the European Central Bank (ECB) could suspicionate its monetary policy.
The future of Wall Street allows us to open up the American action after two consequent meetings.
At values, Renault (4.63%) records the strongest compliance with CAC 40, which was warned on the result of his partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, after also decreasing results this morning and announced the creation inside of a deficiency structure ("bad bank"), which reduces 38 billion most risky assets.
On its hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains headed by EuroFirst300's increases in reaction to pressing information that wants AT&T to study a potential OPA.
On the change market, the specifications on the development of the ECB's monetary policy are well trained, as John Hardy, strategic at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's unique mandate has always been on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the meeting of the next week.
We predict a strong potential of decreasing the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its response against the American currency and has touched a lower than two weeks at $1.3517 at the meeting.
These same conjectures support the obligation market in the euro area.
The Supreme Court validates the Reform Act of Obama Health System
Great victory for Obama administration: The US Supreme Court has said today that Obama's health system reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (law on the protection of sickness and sustainable care) – which requires the citizens to subscribe to a health insurance from 2014, unfortunately to pay a amendment – and said that it was constitutional under government imposing authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, rejected the four most liberal members of the Court, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disappointment.
The Court also validated the other sections of the Act of 2 700 pages and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which claims to reduce the level of eligibility to Medicaid to lose all the federal funds of the programme, was coercitive to the constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was committed by 26 States and the National Federation of India Business.
All the large Republican candidates to the presidential election at school during the 2012 Primary, including the named Midt Romney candidate, were very opposed to the law.
Vibrant hommage rendered to elderly fighters in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cimetary, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotics, they made a hostage to soldiers and dead of all wars on Friday afternoon.
Gerbes were placed in two of the three military quarters of the cemetery by the Master Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Accrochage between Palestinian and Israel at Gaza's border
Four Hamas warriors were killed and five Israeli soldiers were wounded Thursday 31 October 2013 at the evening during a violent crossing at the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only electrical central of the Gaza band stopped working on Friday 1 November after exhaustion of its fuel stocks, announced the Authority of the Energy of the Palestinian Enclave.
A local commander of the Brigades E°dine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another frame of the Army of Hamas, Rabbieh Barikeh, were killed by a car-shopping tyre during an incursion of the Israelite army on the east of Khan Younès, in the south of the Gaza band, of local medical sources.
Two other local Brigades Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud found death when a Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were covered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters conducted a supervisory operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
A attack against a tunnel buried by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, a Israeli car and a blind bulldozer have made an incursion of a hundred meters within the territory before they return.
The confrontation took a half hours, witnesses.
A Hamas portfolio, Sami Abou Zouhri, made the four "heroes" accusation and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas welcomes Al-Qassam's heroes who have fallen in defense in the territory at the incursion of the sionist occupant in Khan Younès.
Many enemies were killed and hurt during the operation.
"The Hamas assures Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," threatened the password.
On his side, the Israeli army pointed out that the goal of his operation was in the past a section of a wide tunnel buried in Israel since the Palestinian enclave, covered on 7 October and intended to, the Army, "Terrorist activities".
Hamas revenged the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, indicating that the purpose was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained a Israeli military military.
During the operation, Hamas has launched an explosive engine with regard to the forces of Tsahal (Israeli armies) and has hurt five soldiers.
Israeli attack in the north of the Year
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of use of the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," Peter Lerner's armies' portfolio.
Furthermore, Israel struck a air military base in the northwest of the Arabia, with regard to a load of missiles intended for the locked Lebanese Hezbollah movement, reported on Thursday 31 October the Al-Arabiya satellite chain.
A American responsibility confirmed a "Israeli flag" but did not provide details about the goal.
"For the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he was pleased.
The Israeli Government's responsibles have confirmed all information on such an attack.
Citing the "sources" which she did not appoint, the Saudi capital chain pointed out that "the bombarding has mentioned a burden of air missiles intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful libanese closed movement that combats rebellion by the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, has made a number of hearing explosions on Wednesday in a air defense base at Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization based on a network of military and medical sources was not able to identify the origin of explosions.
Return in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents her two new group coregraphies in Dance: the first inspired of Henri Michaux' poems and poems, the second insufficient by Satie's spectacles of piano Gymnopedia.
A night that allows you to see the whole prize of Chouinard, the art to the tissues and the black increasing to the white.
A white wall white.
On the toilet, so white, in the large space that is the Maisoneuve Theatre, appears, profile, ends as a line and black clothing, a body.
On the ran, an encree of Henri Michaux is designed.
The body, simply treat, takes its form.
And this form will be the one of the whole room: a infilade of drawings.
The dancers, completely clothed with black, only the hands and the covered face, wait on each side of the game area, predict when the next graph appears, incarn it, increasingly highlights it.
This black and white game of Henri Michaux is made in solar reliefs, in groups in units (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve soles where each exempt his sign.
We are thinking of "Gloire of the morning", where, in the sole, Chouinard performed a series of chorographic tasks written on cards, set online at the front-scane.
It's the same principle, PowerPoint version genuine.
Here, music is strong, powerful and electrical guitars.
Energy is high, the rythme is still quick.
There will be a cassure when Carol Prayer will re-reserve himself under the dance cup, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriness or holding, a part of the poem of Michaux, monocord and monotone in the crying, and will continue by dancing.
And music to distribute, and sequence to recover.
This sound and energy decharge, long, if it can, ends by assurding and worrying.
As it also makes the regularity of visual rythm.
There are some beautiful flashs - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - like these hairs that ebouriffen or these black weights that align the lines.
But the coregraphic approach is missing composite.
We have the impression that the coregraph, rather than go to Michaux' work, was imposed with its tissues.
Results: Bodies are flat in front of the designs.
Michaux' encres, like Gestalt's forms, open a larger and giboyous imaginary than dance, more porus.
Only the end, in negative way, with its dancers heated by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touchs magic.
The public loved, the home was warm.
The Gymnopedia, after the entry, is richer.
The scene is part of gris flag, dancers and a piano are covered with weights, like furniture in a delayed house.
At the piano, dancers are relaxing to play partitions.
Their misadresses in music, touching, give real fragility.
On scene, couples pass, in loved, very sensitive, even erotic.
Group work, small transition soles, in ́s moving, hard, writing is less binary.
Bouffons also appear, family members of Chouinard, treating the red nose, in very polyarised loved parades.
Love is carnassiers, fleeers or players.
The gestuelle, the laughs and the small cries are well translating the archaic, grace and ridicule of the bodies in coit, beings that are based.
But the room takes his real clothes after salvation.
A clown returns to the scene when the public leaves.
There all are allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes are superposed, the dancers cabotine, descend among the spectators, gloom, smoke, short-circle, play applaudment codes, get the sauce in a self-recommended disorder that remains sensible.
The joy and foolishness are overwhelming, and it's the art of Chouinard, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are subject to legal prosecutions regarding Nortel patents
The group with thousands of northern patents started an avalanch of Judges on Thursday patents against phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that he covered in the pool during the sale of patents that occurred after Nortel's failure.
Rockstar, the consortium who purchased North patents for $4.5, made complaints against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other patent violation companies before the Court of Assemblements of the United States in Texas.
Rockstar is arrested jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain ́s which allow publicity to be shown in relation to Internet research terms, indicated the conclusions of the process, which is Google's workshop heart.
It was not possible to join Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar representatives.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that work under the Google Android exploitation system, which provides a feroz competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 for Nortel patents.
Google has increased his offer several times, to finally offer $4.4 Md.
After losing Nortel patents in front of Rockstar, Google bought Motorola Mobility for a amount of 12,5 Md$, a part market based on Motorola patent library.
"Although it has failed to purchase the patents concerned during the investigations, Google has violated and continued to violate these patents," stated the conclusions of the proceedings.
Rockstar claims more important damage and interests against Google because it predicts that the violation of Google patents is obstinated, the complainant.
Explosion of a house-in-house: a defective water heating from the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have stumbled a cigarette when a gas escape.
The explosion of a habitation of a ̈ves, which made two serious wounds on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and its 5-year-old grandmother, was due to a defective gas escape, indicated the replacement of the King's prosecutor on Friday evening.
The expert on place by the parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother stuck a cigarette while there was a fucking and gas accumulation.
The vital pronostic of the two victims is still engaged.
The grandmother was designed by the explosion and is bitterly burned.
The little boy, who lived with his grandfather and his companion, was at his side and was burned more distressly.
"The two victims were intubated and longly conditioned in place before they were brought to the CHU of Liege, it was in helicopter, in ambulance," said bourgmeister José Paulet, descending on the places.
Traumatised, the grandfather was at the time of the explosion.
Healthy and unless, he could join the re-covered resort by the scale remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the neighborhood's household, fragilized by the explosion, were relocated by the CPAS President.
Andenna and Namur's pumpers and Arches' police have been intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection has stabilised the two buildings.
Egypt asks the first president freely chosen to make jury
Mohamed Morsi has made the investment swear, but it is low that his triomph day marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he made the commitment of investment to the presidency, thus became the first president freely chosen and successful in Hosni Moubarak, who was cast out of power 16 months ago.
During his investment in front of the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first islamic president of the Arab world freely chosen and the fifth head of Egypt State since the reverse of the monarchists 60 years ago.
He swore to the 18 judges in black robe of the Court, whose building at the border of the Nile was built to resign to a Egyptian temple.
“ We are looking for better next day, a new Egypt and a second Republic, ” said President Morsi during the solar ceremonie directly spread on television.
“ Today, the Egyptian people have founded the foundations of a new life — absolute freedom, real democracy and stability, ” explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year engineer in the United States, a Muslim Brothers, a group considered as an illegal organization and strongly repressed by the successful governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and cops kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, local hour, followed a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters were gathered before the Court to claim the new president and, on the basis of the presidential stage of the years of Moubarak, it was shortly interrupted to allow its convoy to pass on the very frequent streets associating the city center to the southern villages.
Considered as the uncharismatic "score road" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestigious was considered strengthened since his victory and Friday talk during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but from all those who wanted to end the work started in the raising of 2011 against the president Moubarak.
"The Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in blue and red costume, addressing the judges presented in the urnated beer room where he made a swear.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the Caire University, where he spoke his investment talk.
He was officially accepted by a military fanfare who played the national hymne while he was guarding you.
The Hussein Tantaoui sea attended the ceremonie.
At his arrival, he was accompanied by the song “The People and the Army, the hands in the hand...” intoned by thousands of people gathered in the large amphithatheatre of the University.
Based in 1908 and the former basation of the Lake Education, the Caire University became a fif of the Islamic Student Groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic swear on Friday Tahrir, from which the exhibition that ended Moubarak's authoritary regime last year, and sweared to recover the presidential powers of which the military Council, who replaced the former vice-president, deposed it.
But by accepting officially swearing before the Court, rather than before the Parliament as it is useful, he draws to the will of the army by showing that the fight for power is not completed.
Mr. Morsi's talk on the Tahrir place was accompanied by spectacular popular gestures.

Flight Centre → Reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net benefit forecasts and hopes for record results through Australia and the United Kingdom holidays.
The travel agency now has made a underlying benefit of the exercise of 325 to 340 M dollars before taxes, against a 305-315 M$ preview.
If the current forecasts are reached, it will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290,4 M in 2011/12.
The Director-General, Graham Turner, stated that Flight Centre had made 8% of benefits in the first half and that the second half had entered into force, especially in respect of travels other than business travels and the United Kingdom.
"From the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are rental, and many of them are in the right way to achieve record results on the end of the exercise before deduction of interests and taxes," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the biggest benefits.

Incons shooting a hotel near the piramides of the Cairo
Inconcagouled people opened the fire this Friday on a nearby hotel of Cairo's piramides in Egypt without making sacrifices, resulting from an apparent cut with licensed salaries.

This attack occurs while Egypt has nearly received any tourist since the army has destituted the Islamic President Mohamed Morsi on the beginning of July and repressed the manifestations of its parties in the blood.
Schools are encouraged to be more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the English literature courses, the students will have to study at least one room of Shakespeare, a romance of the 19th century, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to today.
The review will also present new texts to encourage more diversified reading.
A combination of literature and languages will be deleted.
Since 2015, the staff will have to pass a independent language GCSE and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate skills in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must provide tomorrow its new programmes of education and maths – the first materials to be reviewed.
It will make changes in other materials next year.
Furthermore, Ofqual, the Regulatory Agency of Reviews, will devote a management of the GCSE structure, with a new notation system and less courses.
In the sea, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there was a "wide consensus on the need for reform of our examens system to restore public confidence", insisting on the fact that the GCSE would be "improving, more ambitious and more strict".
Studies show that schools have less time to mathematics (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools propose a average of 143 hours a year, and the Singapore chairs are about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to dedicate more than hours of employment to mathematics, nearby sources of the coalition Government have indicated that the GCSE of adequate mathematics – as well as the greatest importance of materials in international classements – would encourage schools to ensure more time of course.
The programme will further focus on "the real world's problems", including financial mathematics.
This judgement means that a law text adopted in July in that State and broadly repealing the right to abort will be able to enter into force.

The ex chief of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cimetery
Mõer, who was disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a common forum of a Berlin Jewish cimetary, says the leader of the German Memorial of Resistance, Professor John Tuchel, in Bild.
I'm not survived at the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common forum of the Jewish cimetric of Berlin-Mitte," he assured on the large-terage day, based on archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great engines of the Apocalyptic Guerre.
The German secret services, the BND, also ensured that during the sea of 1949, M. Vary was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, a document obtained by Image.
Secret services were completely missing.
"From 1945, Mr. Tuchel's body was found in a temporary tomb near the former Ministry of the Reich Aviation by a command," Mr. Tuchel.
He had a "general uniform".
"In the left internal puzzle, especially his service states with a photo," he continued.
Image also contains a document of the Middle quarter's circuit office in Berlin indicating that it was buried in the Jewish quarter of the quarter.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal nazi sadic is buried in a Jewish cimetric, it is an enormity of bad go.
"Our crowd of the feet the memory of the victims," he insisted in the magazine.
Heinrich Mıer is part of the important personalities of the Third Reich who have never been captured.

He walks in the bow, jungle and cross the cups to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroun villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team pass almost every weekend to see hundreds of patients
There are no many doctors in this Western African country, almost 1 for 5 000 inhabitants.
Voice here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 Heros CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to ellipse “Heros CNN of the year”.
This person will receive $20,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
Pengtold 21 years, George Bwelle looked at his sick father to change the periods of consciousness and inconsciousness and to go into hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was hurt in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, Cameroun capital.
At the beginning, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread up to his brain, creating a hematoome that he would carry the rest of his life.
"There were no neurochirurgians in Cameroun," Georges Bwelle said.
We would have brought him to the foreign if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle has spent years to accompany his father in bonded clinics and hospitals, so that he can obtain any treatment that he could benefit.
"It's not easy," Mr Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 hours, go to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are many patients.
People can do it because they're waiting for too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwell's father's death in 2002.
In Cameroun there is only one doctor for 5.000 people, the World Health Organization.
In comparison, the United States is 1 doctor for 413 residents.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Camerounians could not pay the consultation.
Two in five in the country live under the poverty level, and nearly three quarters of the country's health expenditure are carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Dr. Bwell explained.
And because of poverty, they cannot benefit from life.
After seeing his father and so much of his partners suffering, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteers team practiced more than 700 chirurgical acts in the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular chirurg at Yaounde's central hospital.
And he created a humanitarian non-acquisitive, ASCOVIME, which is in rural areas during weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost all the weekends, with a thirty people, they stand up in the furgonets after fixing the medical material on the toilet and crossing difficult areas to go into villages with the most need for help.
The chance doesn't always follow them.
They sometimes had to push the vehicles to cross the cups or traces.
But when they come, they are received in heroes: the community organizes a festival, song and dance and offers them the best available accommodations.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his great smile and disturbing energy – is more than happy to join the festivals.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“ We receive 500 people at every visit, ” said Mr. Bwelle.
Sometimes they live at 60 km from the village, and they come.
In this traveling hospital, various health cares are produced.
Many people receive therapy against malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmissible diseases.
Others can receive cocktails, a couple of collected lunches or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to the oil, but many poor families can simply not allow themselves to buy it.
On the evening, the practical team of simple chirurgical acts under local anesthetia.
Operations are generally practiced in a school, a maid or a house; after intervention, the patient arise and goes into the awake room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electrogen group, the operational room and the sterilisation of the material, Dr. Bwell and its volunteers work until the first hours of the morning.
It's an exciting rythme, but the towns' musicians generally help the team to stay motivated.
“ They struggle throughout the night to keep us awake so that we can continue working, ” Mr. Bwelle explained.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, fatigued but proud of her work.
The group, composed of Cameroon doctors and medical students, has practiced 700 chirurgical acts freely during the last year, and he knows that their presence can make all the differences for those to whom they come to help.
A man explained that the free operation he had undertaken to cure a hernium would allow him to work again.
“ This will change my future and the family, ” said the man.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as chirurgian at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle works also night in private medicine cabinets around Yaounde.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of its own; the rest is covered by private gifts.
"I don't know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of the Drexel University in Philadelité and welcomed in the Dr. Bwelle Group.
It's always at the hospital or trying to find money for his own to be able to carry these campaigns.
For medical students and students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, it is a opportunity to learn about the area they have not with them.
"We were able to participate in operations to help spending blood or send the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," Mrs. O'Malley explained.
It's not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you're studying a doctor in the second year.
Welcome students generally pay their journey to Cameroun, and often come with a collected medical material.
But once in Yaounde, their pension, their transport and education are supported by Dr. Bwelle.
"It's a hero, there's no doubt," Katie O'Malley said.
He gives his life for this, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is not near to escape.
For Dr. Bwell, relatively constant work load is not a difficulty.
Help others to live happy by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him a great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this work, ” Mr. Bwelle said.
And I think of my father.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
Making people ridicule and smiling the pain is the reasons for me to do that.

The two France of Pierre Nora
Perplexes, universities have long planned to define and guard Pierre Nora.
Professor in the amphitheaters and course rooms?
No doubt, but by highlighting his weakness for the crossways, Sciences-Po, the High Students.
Arbitre other works in his Gaston-Gallimard street office?
In fact, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the editor.
Heritage of the wheel that Fontenelle occupies in the French Academy?
Certainly, but knowing that such a sacred could not replace the true holy oil, the of the tess, which has passed.
They volunteerly recognized in him a great wake up, animator and federal of their works, but noteing that it was a little inclination to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the memory of the "Memory Places", which he attached his name, also contributed.
The bad languages could have seen a giant market at the puces, presented by a smart commentator, with a vif eye coup and earlier ears, but incurant.
The two books made by Nora here soon have already stated that the one who passed to not write had many and well written.
The book that is here should give him justice permanently.
However, once again, the temptation of obedience, the intellectual vagabondage, the jubilation started to go up as along with one subject to another.
However, it is quickly understanding that the uncovered objects collected in this book to such a beautiful title cause the brochant to one and the same passion: the discovering the constitutional node of the French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls to the national unit?
It's an anxiety of time.
This is a little, we have been collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the spirit of our leaders at the time, the French identity was an intellectual importance.
It was only necessary to exploit accidents, and the case, jacobinism obliged, was granted to the prefects and subprefects, authorised interprents.
The one who tracks Peter Nora is everything else.
It is not inherited by an internal franchiness but by the definition.
Analyst is anxious of a strange, he is wrong in a forest of symbols, arrested at every step by a rebusing object, tortured with irritant questions.
So this, which is born from the company itself: why, in a so hard country installed in its borders, if oldly charpented and solidly mad, are these dramatic calls to the unit?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to conjure the disorders of the French story.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholic and Protestants: the division forces, here, are very old.
And the most emblématic is obviously the one that finds both the national history.
In view of the revolution seism, the French have two stories, and they have two nations, one monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without reaching the near; anxious, rather than finding the sacredness and the more awareness of unity and invisibleness that she had cut the head to him who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, a binary nation, divided between left and right, lack and catholicism, worship and hate of revolution.
To make this uniqueness of the French identity, nothing worth the four steps outside Hexagone, even though the American escape of Pierre Nora might be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have one and another a revolution, edited a declaration of rights, wanted to establish a new society.
But the American cousin makes it better to highlight what we are clean.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in letters and have no longer been concerned about it.
Here, men covered by an ancient indigenous regime, and even more radical.
There is a consensual revolution when she seed the drama and confessed it.
There are always honored fundamental fathers, and here are revolutionary forefathers who are deceived to make models, and who have been killed.
There is a institutional constance, and here is a case of constitutions, such as such errors to ratify and try again.
France who goes out, France who comes
However, there was a time when the French believed that they could cut off their story and win the curse of the number two.
In this IIIth Republic, a central and creative moment, Peter Nora showed much interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the students everything that was in the former France darkly prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity only had a while.
This is again in the debate, involving a new type of immigration, threatened by the creation of minorities in the European area.
The book therefore offers the fascinating port of France that goes out and the surroundings of France that comes.
At first, Avec would have the historic, which should reserve some surprises.
There's been discovery that the road was a married.
The man of multiple curiosity was turning around the same idea, especially socially.
The road of lisiers was at the center of the center.
And he who had deposited, here more than half a century, a subject on the idea of the nation, but was submitted to the initial exercise of the tess, trusts us, with grano salis, that he will be done by doing it.
Some in a less raid, more flexible and more subtil.
But we don't miss it, all right.
Because much more than the figure of the university course, this tesis says the internal need for a life.
An ancient otage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
Remoted in Beyrouth on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenna 2" team came to film a show of Hezbollah, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Since 2008, he participated in the creation of the defence of the "World Otages", which he has been presided for several years.
Its main objective: ○ the possibility of complaints and bringing their charges before the International Penal Court.
For more than 1,000 days, the four battles of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Mark Feret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital of Val-de-Grece Wednesday afternoon, they have been able to find their families since.
And trying, a little while, to recover the course of their life.
"The New Observator" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former reporter, retired since 2008, President of the World Otages."
From the evening of your release, you were on the 20th "Antenna 2" table.
What are your memories of your freedom today?
In particular, in Beyrouth.
When I'm released, I'm in the coffee of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it makes black - Roger Auque.
He said, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and he says that we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tend too.
It's war, and those who lead us are also very tend.
They put us on the border of a trottoir.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we arrive on the site of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
Some French lead us to France's ambassade.
It's time for parents, family, friends, press...
I remember taking a bathroom for a hour.
And have dinner in the French ambassador.
I also remember a short night to talk with Roger and Marchiani.
The pressure is still there because we have no means to evacuate us to the Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
In the helicopter, we are taking a private aircraft that brings us to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where the Passqua is on ship.
How did your arrival go on the French ground?
We're attracting to Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is there.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible bosscade.
And many media.
When I left there were three television chains.
I'm back and it's full.
The decline from the plane scale, the findings with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and with me, many motors follow our car that Roussin drives.
Motors shoot the bourry to make photos and follow me up to me where I have to do a little police to prevent some to get up.
Media pressure is great.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the condition of emotion and weakness is as difficult to see it.
We're out of a hole and we're just under the median fires.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
On the same night, I'm at 20:00, and the next day I'm on TV.
Then begins a kind of readaptation to life, very dongly, for one or two months that are a little like vacation.
How have medical examinations and DGSE debriefing been conducted?
I had the right to a first medical control in Corse.
The rest was made in Val-de-Grece the following days I returned: radios, exames in all kinds and meets a psychiater.
It is not a meeting that does all, but we know that we can count on him, remind it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It is part of the procedure.
I also met the information services.
They asked me some questions about the otage.
It was logical.
That didn't hurt me.
How do you respond today to the release of the four otage of the Niger?
I'm listening to what it says.
The debate on the ransoms, in particular.
Some things hurt me, others less.
I'm trying to do part of the matters between my past issues as my otage and my president's "Ottes of the world" casette that allows me to put away, and I'm much more interesting to be attracted.
I, for example, ask myself about the definition of resilience.
In particular, I fight, with others, for the legal status of the otage.
There's a semantic problem to me.
It is necessary to qualify the taking of "political" payments - which is most of the time - and to allow otages to have access to justice, to complain and to bring their charges before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and enjoys the release of these otages.
But who says that these otages might also have access to justice?
A court in La Haye is done for this.
Why don't it be said to the payers, "You've baffled the rules of war, like those of all Geneva conventions, we'll bring you in justice?"
However, I'm founded in the right sense.
This message is heard, but it's not listening, and it's choking me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the street to declare Morsi's trial
The wrath is in the ranges of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days prior to the opening of the sentence of Mohamed Morsi, they came down on the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to call for the restoration of the first president, democracyly chosen country.
This is not a trial that highlights this military of the Muslim Brothers.
Until there was no lawyer able to meet him and no volunteer could take a copy of the documents of the matter.
It's not a trial, it's a fashion.
The sentence of President Morsi is a false sentence to a pro-Morsi, which is the one who is to judge Sisi, not the other.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, Nada's massacres, and the massacres of the Republic Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
The police used lacrymogen gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed before the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.

Since the Federal State has recognized homosexual marriage, "all soldiers have the right to a card of identity of the Department of Defence and to the performances coming with," the Minister in New York reminded the Department of the Anti-Defamation League of Anti-Defamation.
"But some States have to release these cards to the partners of the same sex in the national Guard facilities" imposed on their territory, he claimed these States to violate the federal law and principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from many social or health services provided in these bases or access to their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said that the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, had ordered to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The branch of the nine States started by Texas that implemented these performances on the implantations of the Texas National Guard due to a conflict between Texas law and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his own existence by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Caroline and West Virginia, a high responsible for the Defence.
The Pentagone considers the population concerned by the homosexual marriage of approximately 5600 active persons, including the National Guard, the reservation and the retirement.

After hundreds of thousands of people have received opinions of resiliation from their providers, the Republicans have criticized the President during the last days by accusing the American people to be trooped.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adapted his promise of origin.
"The majority of people who have a health insurance that they need to keep," he said in a talk in Boston.
With regard to what he calls "an effort in the present" on resiliations, President Obama encouraged the Americans who received these opinions to seek a new market insurance.
Most people will be able to have full and better health schemes for the same price or even less dear than they are planned.
"You'll get out of it," he said.

A resident of Aubervilliers starts his part of the camp
We don't lie, especially.
In the mind of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Part de la campaign" is not only addressed to the banlieusards.
I chose a card from France as a logo, justify it.
When I talk about bathroom, I address all those who are excluded from the large national family.
However, his project, presented on Thursday in a press conference in his national community of Aubervilliers, was born from the will of better defense of the multiculturalism, this large melling cultural pot that characterizes before all quarters.
My proposal no 1 is to create a ministerial of multiculturalism, indicating it.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, territorial attached, turns back today as "100% apolitic" even if it has not always been neutral.
In 2002, he supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I provide in my program are drawn to the left but if the right people are ready to support me, I will also listen to them, he continues.
There's only extremist parties I'm not talking.
In addition to the multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its program - consultable on the Internet - from many themes that must be talked to the people of the banley, and in particular to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, cannabisalisation, 16-year civil majority, the rehabilitation of the guardian function...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend its ideas on the political scene."For the municipal elections of 2014, it can be fair, he recognizes."
It's a problem of time and money.
The Party of the village should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidature, and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune will already have seven list heads in Metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support mails I received since yesterday are not all out of the bathroom" he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, without acknowledging, that the American campaign “he had gone too far inappropriately”
John Kerry stated that the United States' defensive attitude towards its monitoring programmes would be able to admit that, at several occasions, "the spinner was too far away inappropriately".
The State Secretary also admitted that he had, as Barack Obama, governed on "auto-pilot" when a series of fire-revelations of the Denunciator Edward Snowden on NSA's spending activities had seen on the day.
The flights placed the US government in the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
In terms of an intergovernmental conference in London by video connection, Mr. Kerry said: "It is unrequired that the President and other members of the Government have learned some things in autopilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, then, of course on 11 September."
It was then the first high-range member of the Government of the United States to admit that the American campaign had exceeded the brains, but insisted on the fact that the rights of everyone were not violated.
He said, "In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately."
And the Chairman is determined to try to clarify and precisely to the people that he now had to make a deep review of these practices so that no one may feel wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse in the framework of this process.
However, Mr. Kerry insisted on the fact that NSA was an acting force for good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He said: “We live in a new world where people are ready to go up. ”
There is a radical extreme in the world that is determined to try to kill people, to explode and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have been fully prevented by aircraft to fall, explode and people to be exploded because we were able to take aware of the facts before.
Meanwhile, the American islators will go to Europe to respond to the concerns of the predicted American spending case and convince the Europeans that they need to continue the joint efforts to fight terrorism with the United States, explained Thursday the Chairman of the Senat Subcommittee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut stated that he had expressed himself before the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had pronounced about a possibility of recovery of anti-terrorist organizations because of the feeling of frustration that leads to the National Security Agency's supervision.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that the Europeans remain at our sides in mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a democrate who serves his first mandate, and the president of the subcommission of the United States Senate of European Affairs, during a negotiation since Washington.
And I'm going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work in order to fight terrorism, despite the wrath caused by NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA captured millions of communications in Europe, which made the relations with some of the United States aliens, however, the Agency's director said that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding, because it concerns metadonates that NATO's allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations have stated documents published by Snowden-- which NSA had intercepted data and communications from the German Channelary Angela Merkel and from 34 other State leaders.
The Officer of Information Services, James Papapper, justified the campaign of allies, indicating that it was necessary and that it was a coherent practice on both sides.
In this tumult atmosphere, Murphy pointed out that his office was organizing a trip from the Congrès, which should take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would understand members of both parties and two rooms.
The names of the other participants should be devoted in the future days.
He indicated that the traveler was still to be defined.
Murphy said that the goal of this travel was to allow the relationship to improve, but also to demonstrate “affective closure”.
He explained that the leaders of European States should be honest with their citizens in respect of the type of spinner programs they have applied themselves for years.
"We can set up our monitoring programmes in order to better protect European rights, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to be spending," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to take the weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the rancover of the American strategy in Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States' monitoring activities.
The London Bourse closed on Wednesday on Thursday by the bad results of Shell and on the next day of an announcement by the Fed of the maintenance in the state of its support to the economy, as intended.
