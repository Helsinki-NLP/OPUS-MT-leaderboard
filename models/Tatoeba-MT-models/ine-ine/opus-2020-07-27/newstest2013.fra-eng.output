A Republical Strategy to combat Obama's reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this last as a mythe, claiming that electoral fraud is rare in the United States than the number of people killed by fools.
Moreover, the Republican lawyers have noticed only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, these measures will in part be reduced by the American Democratic System.
In contrast to Canada, the United States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
In this mind, most of the US governments have promoted new laws since 2009 that make the inscription or vote process more difficult.
This phenomenon took the width after the elections of November 2010 which seemed to be 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of voting law in 41 States were introduced during the only year 2011.
The new electoral law requires electors to have a map of identity with photography and a proof of American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws decrease the periods of vote by anticipation, invalidate the right to register as a elector on the day of the vote and return to the citizens who have a judicial dossier to vote.
Before the elections of 2006, no American State had to have electors to present an identity card with photography.
Indiana was the first State to put such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
The Republical authorities pressed to extend this practice to other States.
During the last two years, they had projects of law in 34 States to force electors to present a photographed identity card.
It is important to note that, contrary to Quebec, the American citizens have no universal identity cards such as the cart of the disease insurance.
In fact, 11 per cent of the American citizens, or 21 million people in the age of voting, have no identity cards with photos issued by a Governing Agency of their State.
Furthermore, five million new electors in 2012 have no such identity.
However, it often costs more than 100 dollars for the required identity card.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low income.
In fact, 25% of the Africans, 15% of those who win less than 35,000 dollars; 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of the electors from 18 to 29 years have no photographic identity.
A lot more.
Students, who are considered to vote as more for democratic candidates, are not authorised in several States to use their identity card with photos issued by their institution.
However, these same States authorize members of the fishing clubs or fishing clubs that vote more from the Republican side to use to vote on the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State needed a proof of citizenship to vote.
Arianna was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, twelve States have adopted laws required by electors to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
However, it shows that two Spanish electors of three promote the democratic party.
Moreover, the Republican islators have undergone laws in 2011 to abrogate the registration of electors on the day of the investigation in eight states.
Furthermore, they have limited the right of people and groups to provide assistance to electors who want to register themselves.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, electoral recording campaigns contributed to recording approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have fallen by 17% of the recording rate of new electors in 2010 in comparison to 2006.
Furthermore, the Republican Islators adopted laws in five other States to reduce the voting period by precipient.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33 per cent of the electors who voted before the vote were Afro-American, while those represented only 13 per cent of the State electors.
He did the same with the Spanish.
These represented only 11 per cent of electors, but 24 per cent of citizens who voted before.
In contrast, 76% of the electors represented only 46% of the electors voting forward.
Of course, the democratic islators and their supporters were strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of electors.
Several legislative projects have been blocked by the vetos of the Democratic Governors.
The United States Advocate General has intervened to suspend the most controversy laws.
They were able to limit the deceases in part.
For example, only 16 of 34 States adopted laws requesting the presentation of a photo card.
Nevertheless, the new rules set out will be indeni— to make the exercise of the vote right more difficult in 2012.
Democracy critics indicate the partial character of the laws which have been voted and see a clear objective to influence the results in the key States in 2012.
A report from the Centre Brennan of 2011 shows that the States who adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary to the electoral election in order to carry out the presidency.
It is too early to confirm that these isolative changes at the electoral system will have significant impact on the result of the presidential elections of 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, these measures will in part be reduced by the American Democratic System.
Prostate cancer detection: go through the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present wrong results, with false negative or even false positive results, which result in unusual medical interventions.
What makes men who are already inclined to pass depisting tests even more.
Do you want to pass the test or not?
We asked two experts' opinion.
In the United States studies, there was a lot of contamination among the Witnesses groups, therefore it is difficult to interpret these data and to have closed recommendations.
Another study, which is the European, concluded with a difference of mortality between patients who have been depicted and those who have not received it.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30% and 40% of the chances of having metabolism if not devised.
So I recommend the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if we have a direct parent who has already had a cancer of prostate.
African-American men are also more riskful.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other indolent cancers.
It really needs to make the patient understand the level of risk of his cancer, offering him the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not have long-term lives, and in such cases, choosing for active disease monitoring.
Today, many people with whom a cancer is detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and threaten their life.
We will suggest them to make active monitoring and if the disease progresses, we will offer them a treatment.
Moreover, the criteria to determine who should be treated or not should be determined.
I therefore recommend that the test pass.
But it is important to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to pass it.
In relation to the International Urology Society, Movember created a tool to evaluate the for and contrast of the APS test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle receipt to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good life habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
We believe that if everyone eat well and moved enough, we could prevent 30% of cancers.
"If no more smoke, this rate would be at least 50 per cent," stressed André Beaulieu, the Canadian Cancer Society's password.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heritage.
Many are also totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, fighting against tobacco remains a priority, despite decreasing the number of smokers.
The cigarette is linked to 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other.
This is a great night for people's health.
"Tomorrow, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," deployed Andre Beaulieu's password.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the leave of the cigarette, the risk of a half-fall cancer.
Weight
Embonpoint and obesity also promote the appearance of disease, the SCC.
They would increase the risk of cancer of inner, collon and rectum, oesophag, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that the regular practice of activity during a whole life protects against the cancer of the collon," it says.
Food
The recommendation is also recommended to limit its use of red meat.
In too large quantity, it makes the risk of reaching a colorectal cancer.
Carcuts also, and they should be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"There can damage the cells of cancer and lead to the development of cancer," explains.
Vitamines
In recent years, many scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not concluding for instant.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictible, the SCC.
While one of them found a decrease in the risk of cancer cancer of prostate, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not established.
Moreover, Mr Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about his concerns and family anticipations with his doctor.
"Doing a depisting test doesn't give cancer."
The Higgs' box was cut off
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boss created a whole emotion, the last sea, and for reason.
In fact, we believe that this boss participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing but this.
And then, this is the last part of the existence proposed by the standard Model - our best, or "lower" explaining the nature and behaviour of the material - which has not yet been observed empirely.
But for the physicians, it's not completely sure that it's good for Higgs.
We know without doubt the shadow of an authentic new particulate, and that it replies much to the Higgs boss proposed by the standard Model.
Moreover, new data available this week at a large congress in Kyoto are confirming it, but there are still no data to be absolutely sure about it.
Let's assume that it's the same thing as the Higgs, because the chances of fucking it's getting funny, and let's see what it's about.
There is, in this low world, a fatally incontourable law that wants that two things cannot be found at the same place at the same time.
No way to violate this rule - and do not try too strong, you're going to hurt.
But even if the parts are a well-wrapped world, it also appears that it has a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which sets that two particules cannot take the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantical state" - this "status" consisting largely in certain of their characteristics.
Furthermore, physicians classify parts in two categories.
In a corner, there are good citizens called farms, who are wisely obedient to Paul’s principle.
And in the other hand, the cousin, a salt band of anarchists that have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can be well and well at the same place at the same time.
These woods are then divided into two groups, the site (absolutely extraordinary, otherwise) The Part Adventure, the Berkeley Laboratories: the massons, which we will not reach here, and the "power parts", through which the great forces of nature are spread and to which Higgs' box would be in some kind apparent.
These bones, we need to highlight it here, are not all the exotic beasts that we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, it is through a boss of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "light particle" that is the "altare" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particulate with a accelerated electrical burden or a change of direction, this "depends" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a little like a bullet launched in an ehang.
From this "department" is born a electromagnetic wall (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wall is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the "power porters".
More Stable Field
It also goes with the Higgs boss, at this difference nearly that it is a different field, the Higgs field, which must be "deteriorated" so that this boss appears.
But this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it must be reached of very, very high energy, as if it was a yellow stain which only a very big rock could ride the surface.
That is why a large accelerator of particules like the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27-km circle ring! - to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is not all particulates or materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the loved ones, do it, but others don't - a bunch of paper, for example, will never hold himself on a fridge.
And in the same way, these are not all parts that interact with the Higgs field: those who make it have a mass, while others (as the photon, hold) do not have it.
Now, what is "they can bring" all these researches, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, this uses to verify the validity of the standard Model (MS) and also allows physicians to examine any distance between the observations and the predictions of the MS.
In addition, they are many to wish to find it bitterly, because the smallest difference could open a door on a "new" and cut some floors of the Model.
This, it is important to say, has yet great deficiencies, providing no explanation for the gravity (yes!) or the dark material, which forms about 80% of the universe's material (re-ops!).
But we haven't found such divorces in the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these research in the Daily of Mrs. and Lady of all Monday are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no.
Remember: At the beginning of the 60s, laser pioneers, in the Bell Laboratories, had no doubt the revolution that their jobs would run out.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing left.
In fact, we have already said fire to the doctor Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself set up the first constant laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962, the laser was seen rather as a "labo gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instruments around the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle pointed a small light sensor in 1969 during his optical travels.
This sensor, although it was not of all its original intention, now serves as "eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and he valued the Nobel of 2009.
That doesn't mean that LHC's activities will necessarily transform our lives, but that means that, actually, we never know...
Palliatival care - The best way to guard... ○ The Dever
With its Commission in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be renewed as long as a draft law is prepared.
But in this essential area, many are still to do.
The Device tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in her apartment in Montérégie.
The cancer of the prostate that drew it had left him a repeat of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I spent seven years," he said, "mi-rain fig, aligned in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palatiative care house, from Beloeil, where the watch arrived.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease does its work: a great weakness that prevents it from getting alone to the toilet, even to eat alone.
Attacked before an apetying dinner, he agrees to allow himself to help eat, resigned.
Courageous, it even comes to smile, speaks to the inconneries around him, brings his medicines to him, offers him a bath.
The courage of the daily death.
"My greatest desire is to cure me from diarrhea, it's humiliating," he confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a medicine for this bad.
"In our lives, a man, it's standing," ra' Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Return to the child's stage, for some people, is an inacceptable humiliation.
" It depends on the ability of the person " to accept regression.
Because, from the opinion of many people who act in pallative care, great moments are in the heart even of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palatiative care home suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life pronostic of three months.
At this stage, the "the team of doctors and sisters around them doesn't provide any more care called "learning".
For Mrs. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to be "conscious and disappointed."
But the illness made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she says.
"I have no longer desires in life," she said, "before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She also expects, in the next days, a last visit from her son came from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, the body care and food assistance are provided.
It's the pallative cares that we give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, a palatiative care bed is counted for 11 700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know that we're all finished by one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
Whether it is at the level of comfort, emotional or spiritual.
At the same time, we will accept providing mutual care to brandy or Pepsi, the request.
The diabetes will no longer be taken to control their sugar rates.
And death is part of the daily.
We used a beer at Mr. X last night, dead during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the dead.
"We are helping the neighbors as well as the patients," Ra Nathalie Savard, care guide.
At Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow, but nothing.
On the side of a 93-year-old man who wash his last family assembly in the court, quietly silent in his ears while he was trinken in his honour, a 36-year-old-old young man dies dramaticly, around his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying to survive.
"Seven months ago, three to five beds are occupied by cancers less than 45 years old, " the Dr. Christiane Martel is concerned.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problems with access to paliative care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians simply have no access to palliative care, namely to care designed to pass the sufffrance when a sick has reached the final phase of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the house of care.
And several organisms, such as Victor-Gadbois house and the Palative Care Society at the Grand Montreal home, specialize more or less in the care offered to cancers.
This is precisely this great deficiency in the chebeco health care that makes several specialised doctors fear the adoption of a law in relation to euthanase and self-suicide assistance.
Since October, a manifest, signed by summits of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has proved their opposition to such initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the chebeco health system is not sufficiently perfect to ensure that everyone will have the right to paliative quality care before it is accepted to proceed to euthanase.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spending 14 days in emergency, in great pains, without doing what is needed to delay her.
I'm afraid that patients ask only because they do not receive appropriate care.
And parallelly, many on-speak on their patients to the last day, despite the worst pronostics.
Helena Richard's survival hopes were already minimised when she left a testing chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncle that I stopped the treatment, she replied that she was regreting that I stop me, she told me.
Yet, she told me I was done!
No powerful career
The Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick who ask to be thanks to the patients for not accessing their request after they have been sorrowed by a pallative care team.
But it must be said that palliative cares are not absolutely powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Palative care guide to the Grand Montreal Palative care Society, patients would be refractive to the treatment of pain in 8% of the cases.
At the end of the life, the doctors have so often run to the palliative seatation, which returns to the patient until the time of his death, or spontaneously, or permanently.
We can't do it anymore as if we don't hear this part of souffrance.
Furthermore, the unsuccessful disease will have the opportunity to have this palliative seat.
The sick who are not disappointed always say the same phrase: "I want to."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanase me," that means "I want to be sorrowed."
The implementation of this report has been made possible through a broadcast of the Canadian Health Research Institutes.
Grand wide range scannales in Quebec
Severy officers, BTP undertakers, political and specialists of the Italian mafia's fund collectors raise every day what they know of a wonderful "sêdem", measureing the building industry, officers, politicians, syndicalists and mafia.
A " industry " costed very dear chebeco contributors, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious as the system's scared since the great means have been taken," Ironized Jacques Duchesneau, member of Quebec and former police officer of Montreal.
It is by him that the scandale was exclaimed in 2011, through a funding investigation on misfortunes related to travel contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister of Liberal Time, Jean Charest, had only been refunded.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, occult financing of parties and the corruption of officers.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that the only Ministry of Transports would have spared a billion dollars on contracts," some refreshing their instincts to touch a quota-part!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen two masters," he hopes that it can "demonstrate strategy behind individuals".
A permanent anticorruption unit created in 2011
The Permanent Anticorruption Unit, created in 2011, is also attached to it with its army of verifiers, investigators and analystes of the Government.
More than the police of the "Marteau Escudo" who since 2009 would have led Montreal's "Cartel of Eights" to put the sweet pedal on contracts...
In the last weeks, she took series of perquisitions and brought fraud and corruption against municipal elections such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, major of a village city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just left from his Major post of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspicious that he has repeated potters in exchange of public contracts.
They are formally accused of engineers from Montreal and Italian undertakers of origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
This was a sensation by explaining to the Committee the mechanical mechanism of public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal for years with a mafia intermediate that returned money to Montreal, Major Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambiato seeded all winds in the 2000s, giving more than $88,000 Canadians (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincies, especially to the liberals then.
He also acknowledged that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Prime Minister of Liberal, Nathalie Normandeau.
Ego contracts whose costs were lost
In Montreal, the "sem" of corruption worked around.
Overwhelming Gilles, former public engineer, has been detailed in front of the committee: in ten years, he has received gifted building companies, invitations to travel, golf tours, restaurants, hokey matches and pots-win, totalising $736 000, in exchange of ego-contracts, whose costs he was lost.
Other severia officers have admitted to grass the patt by smoking from 30% to 40% of the factures, by extra false.
Then an organizer of the Major Party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay that he had deliberately closed his eyes on a parallel budget that feeds his boxes with his money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay released the beginning of November, pledging Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elections in Montréal to drive the alarma sonnet.
Maire of the River-des-Priaries, on the east of the island, has been inquired from 2010 against the sale of a municipal country buying $5 million and returning $1.6 million to promotors, in full immobiliary boom.
70% of their money in electoral campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "shoots on a street that allows to understand the function of the system, infiltrated by furms, to stop the gangrene and to eye the falsifs".
The process, she says, is " painful but positive".
We're cleaning the plague, but it'd be necessary for a clean investigation unit in Montreal and a watch, not to see returning doubtful practices.
Like we're doing the household.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but cares especially about the role of "elused at the strategy corant", when they did not cross in the magic!
Considering 70% of his money in the financing of the electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironised, "I said it was only a reality reflective pall."
The Chebeco Government proposes to limit the donations to the parties to 100 dollars, but it will not change the woman, and it will say: "Whatever the electoral expenditures are not strictly limited, there will be money in politics."
He proposes a complete review of the public contract granting and financing system of parties: "We can't go down; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow the house to be rebuild on stronger basiss, with more controls and laws."
If this story contains the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who do not look at it in their own heart...
"The PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This season, you took a new invergue with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by an individual conscience, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I'm going to be on their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On the daily, these elements move me to highlight my level of game.
And, in the match, it's easier.
Everything's going quickly in the foot.
But I don't burn.
From my beginning to the UNF Preparation Centre at my pass to Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed by paliers.
So you will benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
The recrues of this sea are used to dispute very high level matches.
They also know that each training is crucial.
What makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti offers me much about my position.
He is paused by assistants like Makelele, who played at the same place as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all the technicians.
Today, it is not equal to Ligue 1 and is part of the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with huppy clubs.
He covered big players.
I think he'll have other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
Then I got out of a series of wounds.
The confidence he grants me also explains my performance.
What are you looking at the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us a leader place.
But we're still in bus.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have been qualified for the 8th end with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will have our word to say against very good European teams.
We want to finish the first of our puzzle before Porto to be able to get back at the 8th end.
Can the PSG become a large European club at short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a large European club, Paris needs to receive titles and to be registered during the period.
Today, that's not the case.
Financially, the PSG provides the means to set up this project.
In Ligue 1, don't get the title, like the last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a great deception.
This year, we really have the heart of putting this champion title.
Last season, we haven't passed away.
In May, there was deception because we had the qualities to finish first.
We made a very big season.
We ended with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we must be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made a more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right thing.
Although the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in fighting for the title, I think we have weapons to take it.
Do you think media expect too much of the PSG?
It is normal that many of us are expected to see what has been invested and what players we have.
We're totally accepting it.
Then, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and find things to reproach us, it's certainly a little frustrating.
We're wondering what people's waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the Barcelone FC!
We are trying to install a game project.
A team is building up with time.
We proved to be in the Ligue of champions that we could answer presents.
Look at Manchester City who doesn't come, since two seasons, to qualify for the 8th final, they also have made great expenditure!
In view of the invested amounts, you were imagined with 15 points in front of the tree!
It was to disturb our opposers and France's championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good at the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May, we can have the smile when we say that despite all the difficulties, we have done it.
The PSG is totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's operators.
It's better to say there's a Zlatan dependence.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very perfect and he puts many goals.
He came for this and proved that he was the star of the Ligue 1.
He showed everywhere that he was a big player, a world star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This moves others to highlight their game level.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defensors of the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you see the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a deception.
I had to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my wound prevented me from hitting the game time.
I've seen things there, and I got out there strengthened.
Today, I can make good choice matches.
That's what I hoped since I was baptized with the Blues.
We have learned what happened in Ukraine and today we must have an example of behavior.
What are you looking at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualitative group for the World.
The selector is strict, close to players, and inspires winning.
Like Laurent Bla.
But I don't want to compare.
Blue has achieved its goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
The good node (1-1) purchased on 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone's got up for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I never had a similar match in my career.
Avec Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
In contrast with current monetary exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and treatment costs between interested parties.
Moreover, as often in these areas, a political vision is pampable: the conviction that the current monetary system, which makes monopoles, leads to financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonyme), is at the same time a currency (may convertible to dollars, euros...) and a safe exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of par par pars files.
Approximately 200 000 transactions have already been recorded by 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a sum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning around $10 to day (the courses are calculated on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on the currencies held in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes other types of currency such as the "kredits" used to progress in a video game we win by playing or that we can buy (and sometimes turn back).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
However, each time a central authority controls and handles exchanges.
Avec Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are both dischargers of the account book, checkers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the way of a e-mail.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, providing anonymous.
An entry of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to make sure that changed bitcoins exist well in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It has a resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, whose winner, such as a temporary central ban, will have the privilege of acquiring this additional line.
This is a file hacking phase, which is the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take" the new transaction and make it a number before "hacker" it.
The goal is to find the number that gives a special print (much of zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right.
The transaction is then unstructively linked to the engine of other transactions; any change would change the print.
If, to fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same silver very quickly (in less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orpheline because both have different prints.
The computer who has resolved the challenge is 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this rease is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
Thus the number of bitcoins in ↓ is limited to 21 million, but they are di·s up to 100 million, which leaves the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised to each increase in calculation power.
The network's life has already had high and lower.
Web sites provider services for Bitcoin have been attacked and stolen depth bitcoins.
"The useful failure does not refer to the protocol itself," says Peter Noizat, who just started Paymium, a real currency paying company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also highlights the possibilities of whiteness of money through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this failure.
Weight sharers such as Wikipedia have the gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Sha and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the account book and showed that nearly 80% of the bitcoins did not hold.
In November, "genial soldiers" were held.
"Treen thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, converting bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a pedagogic book on this currency, believes much to the potential of this as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are less dear.
The carrier is more controlling his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to run in goods, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
It suffices them to make a address that a phone can "fotograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, which ensures having thousands of users.
There is a general movement of remission for hierarchy systems for more horizontal systems.
"Bitcoin will need time to take place, but 2013 might be a tournament," he foretold.
In its report, the ECB also intends to re-evaluate the different risks today considered high in case of success of this currency.
We've gone from Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their responsibility area in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
Otan and the Americans should follow the end of 2014.
It's time that the Afghanistan army possess its territory and that the Afghanistan choose their future, without waiting for us.
These are particularly the Afghanistan countries we have punished by considering them terrorists.
And we, with our 88 killed soldiers, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Talibans consist of foreign extremists, ancient leaders repeated in Pakistan, but often from lands who hold foreign armed presence, as in the Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even though they have been joined by Jihadists, Pakistanians, Arabs, Uzbek, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurance, these will no longer be when the O’aux will be more discrete.
The outcome of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the Amenderies planted by French credits, was in order.
The trucks of trucks and blinds have joined Kaboul without being attacked, surveyed by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban deferrants on Kaboul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed from their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kaboul was then empty, the land of fire and blood because of fighting between different factors.
Their control of the country was then considered as a kind of freedom, a return to security.
The Afghanistan paid the price of the obscurity of those countries exceeded by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Ancient Mudjahidin, Afghanistan and current Taliban governments are joined in the desire of keeping women in a lower position.
The keys of the antisoviet war were returned to the power in 2001.
They were killed in awards, taking part of governmental lands to sell them in areas to build back to Iran and Pakistan income resources, which benefited from large American subtraction contracts.
They were deceived; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the campaigns, are attempting to a government that is not constituted of furniture.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have been able to benefit from the American wide range: the escape of capital is significant.
Youths are fatigued by war and his ideology.
They covered the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated the benefits of it.
Approximately 65% of the population is less than 25 years old; Kaboul now counts 5 million residents, a fifth of the total population.
In towns, government schools are full, girls like boys.
It will be necessary to provide work to these young people who will not want to return to the obscurity of the elderly parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed opposers, are phone phone freunds; television, and its Turkish feet, which present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Should the authorities who will execute it be considered as ́titimes?
Ancient anti-sovietical fighting commanders are already concerned about re-instituting provincies, which will escape from the central power.
Afghanistan, mountain countries, to strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation in the image of the west nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, to a strong presidential authority, with the destruction of the Prime Minister's position since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially at the time of the elections scheduled in April 2014.
But his country is, since the years 50 and already before, depending on foreign aid.
No industry has been released on the road, no barrier is in state, no important irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and fumes.
Priority is left at the private initiative.
In a devastated country for thirty years of war, a government control on infrastructure would have been necessary.
The voice was spread that Afghanistan had great minerary wealth.
This only made the feeling that the O.O.A. were there only to meet them.
No energy to treat the iron or cover minery on the place, nor transport means to export it through the mountains, there is no mineral operation.
The Chinese have already almost left Mes Aynak's cover mine, allowing international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to keep the large Buddhic site and remaining the most important employees in the province.
It will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, whose imports and exports are largely exported, restore normal reports.
The outcome of the French fighting forces ended on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls, boys, French department at university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "gag the hearts and the minds" and to perform the task that is impossible to coincide with offensive assistance and actions, a service of "civil-military action" of the Defense Minister (Cimic), removed in 2012, has led and has made it well through a small French NGO, many collective interest works and agricultural rehabilitation actions in tens of mountain villages.
These travels, guurmands in hand-d-local work, helped to contain the insurrection: irrigation, puits, potable water, reboating, fruit trees, land protection and growth of cultivating surfaces.
What will we like to remember after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, very hard in these valleys often to over 2,000 meters of height.
The ambassador received tens of written applications from small agricultural performances from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to be free of the insurrection led by foreign groups, what the agricultors said to me, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civil aid in their behalf and directly touch them.
A Constitution for Forces in Egypt
It's a new poker shot of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants him full powers, he decided to play all of it.
By taking all of them shortly, he announced, on Wednesday, that the Constituting Assembly would vote on its final text on the next day.
Just one week ago, the Chairman of the State had granted this Assembly two more months to finish its jobs.
This is two years soon that Egypt is based on a provisional text, several times amending the fragility of institutional stability and leading to legal imbrogios.
This new initiative only increased the fraction in the country.
For its opposers, the Chairman continued in his "autocratic deliver", continued to "training his word" and "covering the right".
On the side of its parties, it is ensured that it is a way to finish the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be organized within fifteen days.
A very short time laps that forces the Brothers to refuse their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the Chairman, it is also a way to find a popular and democratic attitude, while the contest is deceived throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi ○ convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorable, as he said in an interview at the weekend of the American Time.
Since the vote to a precipient vote holds the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "If you vote for my text, whether I keep the full powers," these would probably end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange environment that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, in large majority of islamists, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the liberals missed the call.
Minth November, soon before the Constitutional Declaration, they had closed the door, estimating that they could not make their views valid.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to reach the needed quorum, 11 people, replacement members, have been acquired quickly, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to Muslim Brothers.
Without surprise, it is the most often in the unity that the articles have been voted.
In addition, commentators enjoyed the fact that one of the only divergences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee estimating that the constituent's pendule was badly regulated.
The text, which was still voting last night, is conducting 234 articles.
Objects of all attention, Article 2 remains finally identical to the Constitution of 1971, establishing that "the principles of charia are the main source of law."
The salafist parties, for which the islamic law establishment is a major claim, would hope to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed a more strict application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been held is a challenge of their good will and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the liberals replied, which only see a communication.
Because they are, the islamisation of the Constitution is made through other articles.
In particular, they refer to Article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular to verify the conformity of laws with the charia.
According to the specialist of Egypt So ́e Pommier, it is anxious because "the people called to speak are not chosen and have no democracy.
We can see the premies of a theocraty."
Furthermore, the fears of the liberals are expected by the fact that the next representative of this university should be much less moderate than the current.
"For the time there is no specific religious implication.
With this Constitution, we remain in the framework of the Civil State.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not olems but universitaries, for some formed in the French system," Alexis Blouet temper, who prepares a tess on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes " that there may be a ambiguity around article 220, because the terms employed are dedicated to the religious vocabulary.
It refers to "fiqh" in particular [islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question may be in the future to know in what way civil judges are competent to speak."
In addition to his religious aspect, the voted text last is very criticized because of the powers he grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers appreciate that these are just reduced in comparison with what they were under the former regime.
Other offensive point: the powers given to the army.
In accordance with the desire of military, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national Defence Council.
No more than civil courts will be prohibited in military courts, as required by human rights defence.
These are also part of their concerns about the text that they judge freedom.
The blasphem crime is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which may have serious consequences on the freedom of expression, particularly the pressure.
Furthermore, no articles have been echoing the protection of women, highlights Haba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
It states that the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word was not contained in the Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to express himself at television yesterday, manifestations were planned this afternoon.
The Support of the Chairman of the State will defeat them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the World Centre and a sea of summer are waiting for Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land gathers the size of Bible truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argoumenty i日y has kept five large reasons for returning to Israel.
Go to worship the Holy Places
Be incontourable: the rivers of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever spends these "baptized funds" will be touched by God's Grace.
As regards Galilee, it is the earth of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he washed the storm, or where the fishing was wonderful.
In this precise place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it's good in Jerusalem.
The believers and park the Rue de la Soffrance or the Road of Croix (latin: Via Dolorosa).
This road begins near the Fortress of Antonia (the pretoria), where the trial was held, then led by the streets of the old city to the Church of the Saint Sepulcre on the Golgotha, to the place of the construction, and then to the place of the Peter of the Holiday and the tomb.
Here is the Christian center of the world, the symbol of mankind's salvation.
According to the Christian end, the cross monastery is bound to the place where the tree has grown up to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also opens the most sacred place of the things: the Mure of the Lamentations, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then heard.
Travel in Height
Visit the ruins of the Massada Fortress, an ancient refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the broken rocks of a mountain at 450 m above the sea level.
Only alpinism amators can make it by their own means.
For others, a telepheric brings them to this full history summit.
On the north of the country, between 1 600 and 2 040 m height, the ski station of the Mont Hermont is located that receives many winter tourists.
A ship can lead you from the foot of the mountain.
Ski tracks make up at a total of 45 km long.
Old believers want Gentiles to live at the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country opens nearly 300 museums.
You can't visit them all during one single stay.
Here are the most interesting five who truly worth the turn.
Top: The Museum of Israel held near Knesset (the Parliament).
He opens the very old manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Death Sea, covered in the grotes of the wilderness of Judea, and approximately 500 miles of archeological and anthropological objects.
See also: The Tel-A Art Museum.
The toilets of the printists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are mostly exposed to them.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha expects you with its Turkish bathrooms composed of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only Museum Ra's private where you can adhere to Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or memories.
Input is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of Yad Vashem's Holocauste or Memorial Museum in Tel-A日, which returns to the most dramatic history pages of the history.
The most tragic part is the memory of children, built to memory of 1.5 million children extermined in concentration camps and gas rooms.
You're going in there and you'll be in a total darkness.
Stars are scrutinous.
Then you hear the names of Jewish children and the names of the country in which they are dead.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Health and welfare
The three large balnear stations of Israel are located on the rivers of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers pools, water parks, delphinariums and genuine aquariums.
Note: You can swim in the Red Sea even the winter, because the water temperature does not below 21° while the air can reach 23°.
The Death Sea is still warmer and you can buy it all the year.
This is the most unique sea in the world: it is the lowest point of the Earth, or 417 m below the sea level.
Blue color water contains soap and easily retreat the bathrooms, even those who don't know nanger.
The lands around it are of surrealistic beauty.
There is a treatment based on salt water, limon, healing woods and to treat different diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, astm, echema, artrite, bronchites, diabetes, but too simply delay.
Discover the secrets of Ancientity
They are kept by the old town of Tel-Aá, Jaffa, on the border of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptians of the Earth.
According to the end, Noah built his ark and that Persee saved the beautiful Andromede, with which he has a long and happy life here.
Tourists are especially interested in walking in the straightways that bring the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to your sign, the destination will smile you.
In Jaffa you will be able to cross young married who came to make photos of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, King Herod's city, you will be able to stumble in the Roman theater, "conquire " the force of the crossed ones.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the capital city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, particularly of Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is used today for evening concerts and opera spectacles.
Tourist note
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your own own: approximately 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your journey, it is better to prefer the euro dollars, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (though 1 dollar equal to 3.8 shekels).
For the urban transport, these are mostly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a quick tramway and Haifa has the only metro line of the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the low and high parts of the city.
It's almost a subterraneous officer.
The travel in all types of common transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1 h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to collect the Sabbath on Saturday.
Since Friday evening on sunset on Saturday, markets, stores and public transports stop their activity.
And the working week begins Sunday morning.
Many coffee, restaurants, and hotels serve only for casher food, which excludes pork, sea fruit, fish without eye and meat tables.
All of the lamb and goats, supes and desserts are offered on the basis of coco milk but also the homous, the traditional Jewish peas, the different salts, the moleculed bowls, the falafels, the fruits and the ğums.
There are no wrong dogs in the streets of the city of Israel.
On the contrary, there are many good food cats that spread up the air.
We can see them sleeping at night on the bags of the garied cars.
They love the places and don't let them be regained.
The location of a car varies according to the mark of $37 for $24h (Hyundai Getz) at $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 per day.
Love a wheel will cost you 15 shekels a day.
A input to the museum costs in average 30 shekels.
The language of the numbers
Three million tourists around the world visited Israel in 2012.
It was especially people coming to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118,8 miles of Ukrainian tourists entered the Promised Land from January to October 2012, or 51% of more than in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa on 9 February 2011.
"Who has language, goes to Moscow": Migrants economy money for language
While human rights members and soldiers are polemical about what the law on the binding language test will be given, frauders who sold "false" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint-Petersbourg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, these are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only purpose: wining money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and has established that each migrant worker will have to take a Russian review.
At the moment, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the sector of services, housing, private and detailed sales.
However, with time, the Federal Service promises that the tests will become obligatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, the knowledge of the language, but also the history of Russia and rights funds, should be validated.
It will need to validate its Russian language knowledge for ↓ and renew its work allowance.
Only the citizens of the countries where Russia has the official language status are excluded.
Persons who have received certificates or education diplomas before the USSR fall in 1991 are not also involved in this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The Network of Examen Centres will be subject to the Russian Language Institute Pouchkine, the University of the Peoples' Association, the University of Moscow, the University of Saint-Petersbourg and other Russian higher educational institutions.
Immigrants will be able to review all towns in the country: over 160 centres have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by the Members of the State Court and the Federal Service of Reviews.
But before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have already asked the question in the press: what will this do?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russian and immigrants?
On the other hand, the representatives of the Service will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavagism to work".
Many speak about the defence of the rights of migrant workers, explains the Director of the Russian Federal Service of Defense in Tadjikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only a organized choice system will allow 90% to solve the problems of the foreign ows.
Problems arise for migrants without professional, without training, those who do not know the language and who have no medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migration is intended to cross malhonest people who, under the pretext of help, will provide him a "travel" in a superpopulated homenet where he and tens of his similars will turn for months without food and paper and will be sent between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"When they are promised, they are promised, and when they come, they are deceived, they take their passport, and they do not touch the planned salary," confirms the Chief of the Directorate of Services for the Work of the Tadjikistan Service, Tolib Charipov.
Don't dispute me, Mr. Police!
However, many citizens of Central Asian Republics who want to win money in Russia believe that they know not only the language of the country where they want to go, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, it is not their fault, but their unfortunateness: a few Turkyeeders, Ouzbeks, Tadjiks can be allowed to follow it would only be a primary teaching.
In fact, their families do not even have anything to feed their children without talking to clothe them correctly and equipped them for the oil.
As soon as they come to adolescence, these young people go to win money as soon as the opportunity is present.
It's hard when we don't know the language, they trust.
"You feel decreased and decreased."
Human Droits defenders, however, note an important aspect of the language law.
The reviews will be intended only for migrants who have a statutory status.
Without a statute, there will be no review or official work later.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defense to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy for a official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
Furthermore, money is costed: between 12 and 16 miles of robbery.
And then, a fake record can be recorded quickly for only 1.500 rolls.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have no recording, from which the cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rolls, what to buy thee cigarettes," the journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, Tadjikistan's citizens.
"Speak fast, don't laugh and buy a beautiful work of art"
Since the first day of entry into force of the language law, it was found that the recording papers of migrants were not the only to be false.
Several false language exhibition certificates have already been confiscated by the Federal Service employees.
Papers are out of a color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: every migrant that hoped to easily make the task of the reviews awarded seven thousand rolls for this document.
It is twice and half dearer than the official procedure: this will cost the worker who migrates three thousand rolls.
The representatives of the power and defenders of the Human Droits agree to say that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to just buy these "paper sticks".
The authorities may provide migrant workers who have not able to validate the first review of language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not know Russia will be proposed to work in areas that do not involve being active with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not care for the weapons market
The part of crimes involved in arms is very low
The Russian Ministry of Industry proposes to violate the law against civil weapons portfolio.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: that it is the courses made during marriage or murder organized by Moscow jury Dmitry Vinogradov, who made seven dead.
The police wants to prohibit the gate of caoutcho weapons in the public places and highlight the age of receipt of arm port license by making it 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the Chairman of the Douma Security Committee and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarowaya, who promised that the amendments to the Law on Arms would be introduced to the State Court next.
Everyone is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "searching the vice".
A open letter appears on the Net, in which its authors, representatives of various tissue centres, need to leave "this insensitive duration".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapons is minimum, stated to the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a legal and criminal expert for the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, for a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded at the same time.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent the weapons from submitting to the black market .
According to them, we can find any weapons for a reasonable price in Moscow today.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Providers: from the company to the officer
The black weapons market is provided through several channels.
The main channels are the number of five, ra© Victor Baranets, a retraite colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and the Fourth.
Capture of ́ran taken from a site that takes arms commands
The first is the military trace, namely the weapons that have been stolen during military operations in the Caucase.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons issued from the black market are those deployed by the weapons to the forces of the order.
Baranets explains that it is both a lot of weapons stolen in the police stocks and that they are deployed directly to the representatives of the forces of the order.
The illegal weapons are sold from military stocks.
Many of these are often exploded.
"As confirmed versions indicate that some incendies have been initiated to dissimulate deficit," explains the ancient military.
For Baranets, wear manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons that do not rival with competition on the international market and cover weapons on the black market, especially in Moscou," a expert says.
One of the other sources of black market is the contraband.
A major part of guns and mitraillets comes from poor countries, such as Kirgisistan.
"There is a local, sometimes artisanal production, a mafia has developed and organized supply," says the ancient military.
Where are weapons coming from?
Experts evaluated the appropriate part of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this issue was made in 2011 by the Centre for Analysis of Problems and Studies for Administration.
Some experts have analysed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, the documents and the data of the weapons portfolio.
The majority of illegal weapons, explaining researchers, come from the army and the forces of the order.
The half of the weapons presented on the black market has been found " because of the employees whose work is linked to the weapons", explains the report.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from military conflicts, 14% are stealed at the time of manufacture and 5% are exhausted from "fo-clandestines".
A seller and adviser of an armoury requested to keep the anonymity ensures that no one has long been buying the weapons found by these specialists of folandestine; they are too old.
The most often, he, the sellers will search for new goods in military stocks.
The person bought by a teacher a unit, for example a TT gun.
It's been booked by a grillage.
"He transports it into town and returns it for $900 by unit with two loaders," he says.
"It is true that the police is at the core of all cases, so when crimes are on the point of being eliminated, it makes a control buy at illegal weapons goods," says the seller.
"As in a bullet of lux."
The seller and the buyer are usually through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy appears and offers me to come to Begovaya's holiday where someone had to take me into a "coin" for goods.
The price of the gun, it was given to me in place.
Victor Baranets in military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller, but I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers on the markets, but there you need to come, for example, saying, "From such person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a teeth."
Now I even buy a couple of American pounds with a person I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give it.
Small newsmen are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military officer Victor Baranets tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s when he was prepared for a article on the subject.
The schemes, he, haven't changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "all we want."
"I believed in a bottle of luxe," remembers the military.
There is no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential client, I don't like to buy, we're going with the forest seller and install a target.
"Let me go and when I am convinced that the army works well, we start negotiating," describes the expert.
A bottle from his hands
Research engines show sites and groups on Vkontakte where weapons can be purchased "for different uses".
For this reason, no document needs and nobody to meet.
"There is enough to have a specific sum of money," it is written in advertising on the site "Buy a gun or a fighting mitraillet".
The users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we're selling the minors?
"No permission, of course," the user asks "Ivan" (conserved spell).
"Build TT. Moscou", wrote "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has distributed a large network of false sites and has collected the desired people to buy fighting weapons to the skin.
People run on food as hungry wolves, and then they get to explode carbon in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and ancient military
I have heard of this type of schemes: usually the site is stored outside the field of application of Russian laws.
People take the orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic buyers.
"He returns a photo and instructions indicating where the army is hidden," explains the secretary of the "Doit to a gun", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets states that by making a request on the site, we can be found without weapon and behind the bars.
The Federal Security Service has distributed a large network of false sites and has collected the desired people to buy fighting weapons to the skin.
"The people run on food as hungry wolves, and then they get to explode carbon in Siberia," he says.
A Makarov for $100
Buying illegal fire weapons, which are the experts, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a gun", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It has been exited from long-term records through the direction of these average storage entries.
According to the official data of the Minister, compared to the period of January-October 2011, the number of crimes in Russia was decreased by 7 per cent and was decreased by 22,9 miles, while the cases of flight and extortion of arms, municipalities, explosive substances and bombs were decreased by 7.8 per cent.
United States: Stakeholders and supermarketing employees are increasing
Nearly a quarter of the United States teenagers passed by a casier work at McDonald's
In these last days, a bath of protests has been set up against the lowest salaries practiced by the supermarkets Walmart and the famous quick restoration chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentyky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this vague will take the width or sleep quickly.
These actions are supported by syndicates and a certain number of left-hand.
Parallelly with modesty salaries receiving base salaries in Walmart and in rapid restoration chains, demonstrations organizers want to create syndicates.
This sector is not for the intention covered by the syndical movement.
46 cents per year?
The manifestations started last week, after thanksgiving, the "Black Vendredi", when a deferral rain of sales appeared to millions of residents were scattered over America and sometimes square.
That day, some Walmart company salaries, who work in the world 2,2 million people, left their job to organize green pickets with syndicates and left activists in the company stores whose products are intended for consumers of modesty and medium classs.
Walmart markets all: cake beds by car bacteria, aspirators, eggs and milk.
Products are in average 8% to 27% less decent than in large supermarkets.
That's why many unpaid salaries in Walmart do their courses only on their workplace.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can be allowed to sell its good market products, particularly because of low salaries of his employees.
The latests also demand hard work conditions, such as the lack of leaving cars or driving scanners.
Participants of the "Black Vendredi" manifestations requested an increase in salary, they complained that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased by $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic salary at Walmart that touches $9.5 of the hour, it is a sum that it cannot allow.
Scientists at the Californian University of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost $3.2 billion.
It is 1,1% more than it currently expenses.
If Walmart transfers all the salaries on consumer eggs, each course in the store would return to 46% more.
They will cost only $12.39 more than now in one year.
Walmart's parties welcomely note that protests have occurred in only nine states and have no damage to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in the 8-hour stores on midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5000 articles on the second.
His boxes have made a total of 100 million transactions for the Black Monday.
The Dan Fogleman's password assured in an interview at the left site of Huffington Post that "minder than five" Walmart's salaries had left their posts and that protest was only a "operation of as many other" from the organizer's syndicate.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, so they are not yet implanted there) but the McDonalds and other good market restaurants.
McDonald's announces to sell billions of parts and then they don't even give you any disease and don't pay you the work you've done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York municipal Council
Currently, the minimum payment provided by the federal legislation and the New York is $7.25.
The fast-foods increase them with time, but shortly, in the meantime, its basic employees are touching New York $8.90 for the hour.
No one touchs less than they in this city.
For me, it's impossible to live with this sum in New York.
It was a time when nearly a quarter of the American teenagers worked at McDonald's after school, living with their parents.
A few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find me to interview McDonald's salaries who are pleasing to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum, we find comments that it is unresponsible to make children if you don't know with what you're going to eat them.
The manifestants who launched the motion Thursday at 6:30 near McDonald's 40th street and on Madison Avenue requested that the feed cabiners and feed kitchens be paid at least $15 for the hour, either a multipliation of more than two times than the current minimum payment.
They also asked the creation of syndicates in the rapid restoration sector.
The American law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the protestants of a syndicate by brimades or licences.
However, their administration rarely simplifys their life.
For a syndicate, to avoid quick restoration remains a difficult task, and this is for specific reasons.
One of the main ones is the extreme rotation of the staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous manifestations had nearly several other rapid restoration chains.
The fair time of the protest was the race in the middle of the day near the McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including Jumaane Williams, member of the municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's announces to sell billions of parts and then they don't even give you a congested disease and don't pay you the work you've done honestly!"
The manifestants were supported by other new-Yorkaan democrats, especially by the candidate at Major Bill De Blasio, who said that "we must all support rapid restoration salaries so that they receive a righteous and economic salary that deserves every New Yorkian.
The New York Times characterized this manifestation as the most important that he knew the rapid restoration sector in all his history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it without counting that they were not all fast-food salaries, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is hard to say if this mass movement label will make small.
"For the moment, we're only coming in the middle of the brain."
Recently, the fans of the news have been used to understand the increasing reality through special lunches.
In the past, Google has denied this being his current model during its annual reference and in November we have learned that Microsoft had made the patent request.
However, it shows the interactive interaction with the director of the interactive 3D group of the Microsoft de Cambri laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the lunettes are already from the ancient history.
They are tried by the perspective of manipulating objects in the nudle air, by creating open spaces.
- Can you tell us what your research group is doing?
- We work on interaction between human and machine and at the same time try to expand the borders of this interaction.
Humanity in its enemy remained for the time in pixels on ıran plat and sometimes in tactile.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and become radical changes that will happen with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the command by the gesture.
- What is the future for us too?
- Although Kinect has made the interaction, many things are running on ́ran plat, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance is not actually real.
We are trying to change this and we work on actually 3D image systems that work on different Property, including projections.
We need to bring the computer world out in our world, and make it more tactful.
For this, however, not only the user, but also the space around it must be identified.
Thus, we can complete the real world by practical objects in a more practical way.
And to start, let's get out of these stupid reality cakes!
- What do you think of the voice command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
It is not possible to say that it is the panic: the question of confidentiality is as we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
Actually, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in his nick.
For example, to command devices in public places, we had a project for which we pensioned to gestes, not to wide gestures, but to discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestes were not captured by the camera of the camera, but by a bracelet carrying the hand that recorded the mouths of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of an hour.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: geste + voice.
- That's what I mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this coat?
You'd do it with the word and the gestes.
- Of course, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt according to what the machine can or doesn't at a given time?
- Not obligatory, but it's a mutual approach.
I think we must work very closely in the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
For example, it may be the case of laser sensors, they produce a quite good resolution in depth, and it is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not love in modern cameras?
Do they miss resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, we are based on the current generation in our work on 3D.
It would obviously be good to approximately 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of matrice and depth.
In comparison to this last point, all the current terms are quite good, and this is the work of the conceptors of algorithms.
The resolution is to be kept in mind with the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed is also very important, the number of frames in the second.
Human movements are enough dynamic, and 30 c/s are really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, gave to sensors a regular delay of treatment between 1 and 100 μs, current sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how this affects human and machine interactions.
I would like to need a device of this type in my work, but not need to touch, to have more frames on the second.
- But don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect has three "camers" today, which one is actually a infrared issuer and the second, a recipient of the reflective signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the field.
It does not use to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or empire it by increasing the required calculation volume.
It would be interesting in creating a similar flat product in Kinect, playing with the camera corbe and seeing how this could help to define locations.
- As I remember, Microsoft, at the Google Difference, didn't present his lunches to the public.
Do you not think that from a view of the daily use of the reality's increased reality, the lunettes are one of the platforms that present the most prospects?
- Of course, walking throughout the time with a smartphone the hands lifted up is not practical but this is what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitional" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass lunches to smartphone.
The lunches are a very personal device and that makes their strength (the personal elements are those you're the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased from the lunches will not allow you to work on objects in relation to others.
- Imagine an instinct that the manipulation of holographic objects in the air is more accessible than to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which the opposers of this idea point the finger: there is no tactile feeling!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers do your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh part of the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eightth could be very well the feeling of tactiles.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to use image support.
She's recording the pressures perfectly!
However, there are also ́s actually intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasound radiations directed to a precise point where the finger is located and that gives you the feeling, for the moment still low, of a air surface on the bottoms of the fingers.
There are also bracelets on points that affect the nervous fingers of the fingers, and they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to hit the brain?
Make him believe that he feels what he normally should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't been trying yet.
There is still a task therein which will still be a long time to do bad: the way to believe someone who is very low in a very low space that he walks in an open space almost finin - we work on the concepts of running cups (nothing to see with those found in the fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also gentle bullets.
For the moment, it is only a means of crushing the brain, but there are still many years of work.
This is what makes work on reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in absolute condition of fertility.
The government of the Go and not of the culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The forward guard of Petersbourgeois" dedicated to quotedines who are in front of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already accepted eminent actors of the art scene of Saint-Petersbourg whose performance go beyond the town's border and who have found an enhancement in Europe after having been with them throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverse painting Kiril Miller.
All the city knows Kirill Miller, this man rather barbu, all red dressed that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the sea Garden or even at the feasts and vernissages.
Kirill Miller's tables always raise the footballs, whatever their exposure place.
He is one of the most social and philosophic petersbourgeoes containers, one of the founders of the new mythes.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the Petersbourgeois pregard at the end of 1980s and from the beginning of 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants ridicule and makes them a good humor.
Recently he took in his hands an orgy of Barbary and became the symbol of this instrument in Saint-Petersbourg because he had enough mature for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you park the city in red and not in yellow or in Turkish blue, for example?
- I chose the red as a specialised couturist in the aspect and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painting, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not grass leads to agressivity and a negative agitation.
But my challenges are intended to start the discussion.
All the story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discuss.
And when did you realize that you should be painting?
- Exhibiting the Nevski Cultural Palace where my works are.
I realized that it was my way.
So the vague of old non-official paintings was passed and the new, free, in my kind, were incomprehensive.
I started connecting friendship with the new vague paintings, with those of the Postgazonvchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more vague.
I'm interested in the theater, in the mode, in music, in all kinds other than words.
And all this happened in your artistic clinic... - It was important for me to find me in the center of the Culture of Saint Petersbourg where the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10 that opened a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of the petersbourgeois bohem.
Many are born there: The NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour come with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easily play-back songs in moving maillots, and they counted among them Igor Vdovin, today as a player in the mode.
When the group began to happen alive, he became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg did not affect emissions before Hali Gali's time.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was when his great career began, but his training and his basic education was with us that he received them.
Galery "D137", Griboeiedov Club: these are the effects of the artistic clinic.
Our employees went out there as a habitual.
I am a hero of the past centuries, since culture wanted to say something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the price of our city's personalities.
I was called "Pentra of the Year", and then my kingdom ended.
It is not comfortable to work in a new time with ancient rules, but I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, but we can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your works are characterized by a halt.
- Many of my tables are hits, they have a very strong modernity and acuteness.
I'll have a programmed exhibition "The Russian Museum through the clowns".
The clowns belong to an intellectual category.
Before I was somebody of the social, today it's bad and it's afraid to be like this.
But with clowns, everything's going out, the tragic falls.
I love the magic, I have big ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through the total and mandatory destruction.
Today, it's the habit that is important, we're interested in external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him the hand, but we need to break him in the throat.
And the lie will be removed by the disgracement.
- Recently we have seen you in the role of Barbary's orgasm player. - A cultural city must have such a hero.
Who else than me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can be beautiful too?
- Today, commercial art must be cared, delicate, liquor.
A disintegration of culture is in progress.
Before, people were divided in cattle, the bohemians loved one thing, and they boyed another.
Today, everything is divorced in micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a 100-dollar currency to please everyone.
Today, we need to think about who you're going to like.
Each watch has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to Stas Mikhaijlov!
- It's people we've threw out who's coming to see him, it's the sexual and social side that runs.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come, and at the end of the account it's less management, money, all lost.
I've got my fans, the main thing is not to hit them, not to throw the v.
When I was young, I had tables that a collector locked near Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables that usually are those that we are drawing at the end of life.
Today, we often confund the ideas.
It is said that there is spiritual culture, consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture, it doesn't have anything to see.
I am a representative of the culture yesterday, I grew up with the example of the paintings that lived in poverty and died in poverty and who were just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
Kirill, what's missing in Saint Petersbourg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the cultural officer.
But everyone can't work in culture.
Under the government of good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they realized that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in Saint-Petersbourg that could be experts, but they are removed, because there are higher experts who will evaluate these experts correctly and break their way.
Currently, it's the "Reign of Go" that flows.
The same Erarta, but they distinguish in this sense that they honestly say that they do not take all the arts at the same time, that there are paintings that must be other museums.
- For you, what is this Saint Petersbourg?
- Saint-Petersbourg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a land for this.
And on our stones, the art is hard to move.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many interesting people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
In our home, this bed is very fine.
We must put the art into the way as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of Saint-Petersbourg's bourgeois
Shut Down in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate heating or Property with asteroid dies.
Space vessels with landscapes are searching for a scarce planet.
To save mankind, a big question is: how can we continue to live our species as a presence or even on a secure planet?
I don't think there's a lot of choice.
In fact, there are two real planets that we can win, is it only by hypothesis.
"This is Venus and Mars," Vladimir Surdine, researcher of the State Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more adapted to life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at a very high height or on the orbit of Venus... in the space.
We began to be interested in reproduction issues in the space by focusing on the flower.
A half centuries ago, there were experiences on plants.
Four generations of small wheels cultivated on orbite did not distinguish in any way from earthly varieties.
Then we put on an orbite of insects, small drizzle mosques.
In 1979, cattle eggs were sent to the space to see how an emissor was developed.
We get a totally normal powder on the output.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is linked to the fact that the powder must find a support, it must be put on its patts and start moving "," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Science Academy (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding any support, the powder acted disorderly.
And at the end of 10 hours, the newborn saw their instincts completely otherwise.
Pushes did not respond to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die at the end of four days.
"We took their eyes twice, then we left it, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev by finding the failure of experience with dust in the space.
The last biological "miniature" ark with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago.
Experience will continue at the early 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only ship species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their feet in the space.
In principle, we haven't discovered anything overnatural.
"It was still biosatellites, and then it is the only experience. This type of research must be performed," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats were born to their generation.
However, it is not yet possible to perform reproductions directly in the space.
It's not a bad business.
In their habitual environment, animals are no longer able to perform their sexual instinct.
In contrast to animals, man is able, in principle.
Homo ́ens has abstract thought, he is able to create a suitable emotional fund.
This type of experience is not performed for ethical reasons.
But women have gone into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female is what mankind has more valuable.
Our mouth was swimming and no one on Earth could say if he would stay after a flight in the space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vaınadzé, retraction from the area and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after his flight in the space, the first cosmonaute woman Valentina Terechkova was born to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaiev was also cosmonaute.
In 1988, the second cosmonaute woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been two times on orbit, and even worked in an extra vehicle, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk is lost.
We have little, even very little cosmonautes who have not had anything and who give birth to a full health descendant after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaute, the Soviet Union's heroes and Russian heroes, Valeriy Poliakov.
However, humanity must seek new solutions in bio-eyees, protection against radiations and creation of artificial gravitation.
Laboratory of the Cosmonate Preparation Centre for hydrology: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero flotability, the cosmonautes are trained to extra vehicle outputs.
The water imitates the appointment.
If for adults, water is comfortable but yet a foreign environment, for food, is their real element.
Small men ambies confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby develops approximately 9 months in the lymphatic liquid of his mother's neighbor, it is easier to be used to water then.
It is in principle logical, because since his birth to his first bathroom, it is only 2 weeks.
"It is very little to forget," explains the Natation Instructor for Food, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just born the appointment is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a weight force.
In attendance, the muscles of the breast, the bassin are very fast attrophing, the ability to move the baby is lost.
All right, let's ignore this by putting on the accommodation simulators.
Of course, we can prepare a shopping in a special room, the woman will come to make it out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite to consider this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it doesn't feel the earthly attraction, it doesn't form the squelet or the muscle system.
You can't dress a food as an adult with a special combination for training.
It will simply be private of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will come back to the Earth of an unexpected child, completely disadapted," provides the Committee for Bioetics of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Science Academy, Igor Pestov.
Birthing of children in the space is still higher than the theory.
However, with time, it will become real, when the Terriers will go into their ships to a far planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in the space.
The leader of the ISC (Header Institute for Finance Control) said: " The control of independent pseudo work (in Czech system Swarc) has failed due to politicians.
In the field of public markets, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and a quality legislation, but it is at the level of its application.
That was what Miloslav Kala, the President of the Supreme Financial Control Institute, said in an interview for the currently.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just, and I think that it is what does not fail in us," Kala said in its comment on the present situation.
A joint control by Czech and German inspectors suggests similar conclusions.
It cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the " Swarc system " by Peter Netime.
Mr Prime Minister recently said that ODS was not worth importing undertakers with controls; is it therefore permitted or prohibited?
"The law must be well applied in a way or in another way, so if it prohibits something, even the Government's leader can prevent the action of a charged authority to investigate the requirement of compliance with the law," Kala states.
During the meeting of the Committee on Control at the House of Members, you called on a Czech-German project in the context of which the legislation on public markets of these two countries was compared.
What was he particularly questioned?
It's a parallel control that we've launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, the European legislation provides how to manage public markets and specific national legislation as well as a practice that is expressed.
We have gathered all of this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, we have shown very interesting differences: usually speaking, our legislation may be "creader and better quality", however, some parameters, practice as this is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it does not suffice to develop more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law.
How can this project help you concretely, and what results it for you?
A common control of this type should just contribute to what we stopped to strive to specify the laws, to reduce and improve the levels, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means the matter to a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lower) to exclude all riches and possible activity.
But by decreasing market levels, we will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It may be that this system is so highlighted by the papers, that those seeking the falls will find much more opportunities than if the floor remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems on the implementation of public market legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an analogue institution to our ISC or a different organizational mode?
In the case of institutions, as well as the ISC, the Bundesshof, which is organized similarly, also has a little different advice, but these two institutions do similarly .
The skills are also similar, in a certain measure, with a nuance compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, therefore it also provides accounts of this type at the level of different countries.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to State resources with us.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are there controlled at the level of the Countries' accounts.
As regards national legislation, is it more simple than our?
I would not like to make general comparison without specific data, however, in some areas, Germany is often designed as a model, but it cannot be said that it is better in all areas.
Is it possible that they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I have no comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country which we consider as a model is also confronted with a series of problems.
Otherwise, they would not have any benefit to cooperate with our institution, right?
With regard to national legislation, which has signed for you, as a institution, the amendment to the law on public markets, have its effects already been felt?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it has no effect on our control operations yet.
As we do later controls, we need to count with a certain delay.
Our observations are only related to the process of preparation of future controls - we have launched a new instrument for "detecting the risks of bad management" with which we have passed to the crystal of nearly 14,000 public markets - these changes will be made clear because the grounds have been made and the conditions of certain types of calling procedures and soon.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather than as a benefit or as an advanced charge for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may occur is that these rules become more serious and it is not possible to respect them.
The provider (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) already under the regulatory regime contradicted the subjects controlled to accept that any violation of market law means a lack of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law more serious in this way?
No, not this way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence in the decision process.
Such a system will benefit from pressure on administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's see where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS was not worth importing undertakers with controls of the Swarc self-disting system - what does that mean?
Is the Swarc system prohibited or authorised?
The law must be well applied in a way or in another way, so if it prohibits something, even the Government's leader can not prevent the action of a charged authority to investigate and require the compliance with the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and make it, but he can't say that we're going to act as if it was nothing.
The market law has relatively strict rules on formalities to be fulfilled and, just in order to protect the call for offers.
But it is also tragic that a subsequent is removed only because of formal failures.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just, and it is, in my opinion, what makes us missing.
The roads are in iron places, but most remain practical.
In some places of the Czech Republic, the roads are ice and are also weakened.
However, the network remains largely practicable, in some places with accurate monitoring.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practicable this morning, but by iron places and also inclined.
The temperatures fell and covered between -5 and -10 ° C but they should raise up in the day.
The snow falls ceased in the region and there is only a finished snow bed in the plains.
However, the crops of the Metallifer Mountains (Krushné hory) are covered by approximately 30 metres of snow.
The data of the regional road maintenance services are shown that the visibility was reduced because of the brouillard.
The rapid R6 road and the national roads of the region are now practicable without difficulty.
However, monitoring remains to be introduced, for example, on some points where the clothing can be ice and glittered.
All departmental roads and third category paths, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
It remains on some of their crowns of yellow snow residues and by places covered by traffic.
In particular in high-level areas, drivers must strengthen their monitoring.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové regions
The Direction of Roads and Autoroutes reports on its website that certain roads of East Bohemia are threatened by the training of worms and that snow beds are broken by trafficking on the roads in the mountainous and heighted areas.
Road maintenance services keep drivers against the risks of sharing in the areas of Pardubice.
There can be verglas in the surroundings of Lanškroun, Usti nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Myto, and this, mainly on the departmental and third category.
The paths I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly located in the Mountains of Géants (Krkonosche) and the Mountains of l'Aigle (Orlische hory).
In the districts of Rychnov na Kneu and Trutnov, a snow-snight bed is presented on the roads in the high-sized areas.
In the East Bohemia, the time will be dry today, most often decayed, with possible cloud passports.
It will survive a low wind and the temperatures will usually dark between -3° and + 1° C.
Region de Pilsen
The routes of the Pilsen region today are practicable, although, by places, it is necessary to demonstrate a strong monitoring and adapt its conduct to weather conditions.
This morning, the temperatures are wearing between -3 and -9 degrees C.
After the latest snow falls and the refrigeration followed, some communicating ways may be in ice places.
The drivers may expect to cross the broadcast areas, however, the visibility will be gradually improved.
This is the information of the regional road maintenance service.
D5 is practicable almost without difficulties, however, road communication services recommend an increased monitoring between 80 and 13 km
The clothing of most of the national roads is dry and frozen.
Some tronces can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-Sud and in the district of Tachov.
Departmental and third category roads are humid and, in this case, the guard against iron tronces applies.
The drivers must be watchful, especially on the less frequent routes of the Shumava region.
Region of Olomo
The drivers in the high-scale areas of the Olomo have to count today with a spacious snow-snee bed on the roads.
This bed remained on the hall called "Chervenohorské sedlo" and on the road in direction of Videlský cross, after chemical treatment operations.
The snow falls forced the staff to hold the roads on the ground this night; it fell over three metres in the Shumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most of the shoes are practicable without difficulty.
" On the heights of Shumperk's district, there are snow residues.
The Jesenic leaders must expect to meet the cold "Chervenohorské sedlo" a spacious and molecular snow bed " said to the CTK today the leader of the traveling services of the street of Shumperk.
They have also become placed in the Jesenic district; these last, after chemical treatment, roads are now decayed and mixed, even in the highest areas.
Nevertheless, in the district of Olomo, the roads are practicable without difficulty, in the district of Shternberk, the drivers should take care of in the forest areas in the wooden couchs.
Regions d'Usti na Labem and Liberec
Since this morning, the North Bohemia road maintenance services have reported a number of difficult tronces.
In addition to some places covered by snow or snow, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ustecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain lower than zero, so the snow and the snow should keep on the roads. In the plains, especially south-east of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there are no problems and roads usually.
No difficulties for the time have been reported.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of verglas, especially around Stéti.
According to the meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for his training: rain and snow source during the day, cloud and ice during the night.
Furthermore, since the main axes of employment, difficult conditions on national road 13 to the border between the regions of Uzti na Labem and Liberec are reported.
The closure of the closure between Telnice and Knínice is due to trees that were covered under the weight of the snow until the shoes reached.
Simon Ornest said, "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these alarming news, the kind of pieces in which we love to fall.
In our group The Tap Tap, we are rather surprised and we are the only group capable of collecting a positive rest of energy to relax or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going up a totally unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you submit this project more detailed to our readers?
It's a charitable action that we've been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the potential marketing at the end of the calendar-- Maya year for 21 December at 11 a.m. to 10 a.m.
The guard on 20 December will take place three concerts at the same time in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost at the time when the Maya calend will end on the island of Kiribati, which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone of 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had this idea?
In the past, I think that was my idea, then we designed everything with our Creator, Honza Augusta.
Outside the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to think about the world's condition that we leave our children.
At the end of the calendar, Maya, we created a collection of unique objects, including chaussures, T-shirts, sacs, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The The Tap Tap Group with other interpreters has also recorded a hymne against the end of the world, named " The End of the World Canceled " (Check " Conec world zruscheno ").
It's already very popular on YouTube, will we hear it in these charitable concerts?
Of course, at the end, if we succeed and that the end of the world doesn't happen...
It will be singed at the same time by all the interprents in the three concerts.
The hymnes will also be joined at a time given in the context of a direct, in fact unique television of Czech.
The words of this song were written by Tomás Hanák who also holds Jesus' main role in the clip, Xindl X also sang it...
How are you coming to cooperate with them?
We are with other characteristics of the Czech show-biz, because we organize many charitable concerts and events...
We strive to intensely participate in these projects.
It was evident that most of them were interested in such cooperation and that they were amazed.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre that is accessible to decreased mobility and whose work we are working in the implementation of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly attend the Jedlikkovv Institute and offer them activities that interest and entertain them.
Students themselves do not have the way to take courses, we are trying to help them in this way.
In the context of the end of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project into a new independent building.
Should several groups of music and interprents ascend on scene at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, do you have the choices?
We have tried to develop a programme that is addressed to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will ascend on Chinaski, Lesbian Support, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You will find all details on www.kpks.cz.
Do you also prepare for other " mega events " of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the Premium of Prague; there we will certainly prepare a quality programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play the next year in the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalists, for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of handicaped people.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrifying that it looks at the first border.
We have five electric carrier members whose engines have to travel in support, naturally we also tribal a lot of baggage and instrument boxes....
Until everything happened more or less well, CSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we came from recently, everything happened without problems.
Thanks to your traveling to the foreign, you can compare what these countries are different for what is access facilities for reduced mobility people, the attitude of the opinion regarding handicaped persons and so later.
What were your experiences until now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we have just been witnesses in Moscow that all are still in a initial phase.
In relation to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to handicaped persons; there is still no longer a person who moves in the centre of the city only.
They have not yet been viewed as a evidence of giving priority to a person in a steward.
Fortunately, there is also an effort to draw attention to the problems of persons who are handed up is being created.
In what way do we still need to trace the most developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late...
It is important to mention that improvements and perfections continues to make efforts made by the parties concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is really hard that people with a heavy handicap move themselves alone in the public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not even very often there that many handicaped people actively participate in social life, at this point you, The Tap Tap, are rather than the point of progress!
Respect for public and access facilities is a thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we will have sports, artists, actors, politicians or famous jurists.
For the moment, there are only cases isolated by people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, we return behind a few years, what moved you to create this group in 1998?
I started working as a Jedlička Institute, where I found a lot of young jobs to invest in something.
And as I am myself musician (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a saxophone, we created a musical activity.
And then, with time, as our moderator Ladja Angelovič said, we have a little lost the control of the situation (laughs).
The success has occurred only in the past years, if I don't miss?
It is true that the creation of links with songs with and actively work in promoting the group has helped us.
We realized that if a job is not ­ it is as if it doesn't exist in the fund.
Thanks to the subventions of the European Union, we can also enable us to have quality teachers, equipment, and then.
Did you go to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a certain way, it is logical: everything new is accepted with mentality and it takes a long time.
Rarely are original projects, and I am sure that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally mercy, it is natural ...
But mercy is completely unusual, because people with a handicap are not suffering, abandoned from all, which we have to be pity.
These are people who can live a whole life apart and develop, in the condition that they have the necessary means of certainty.
I often say that when people with a handicap come to realize something, it is not just a progress for them but for the whole society.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you are a exigent leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to make quality work, we must be intransistant in many areas and require a certain discipline.
But I think it's really normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds, and when they realize that they have to come to repeattions twice a week, follow the preparation courses and spending a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But this works the same way in each group who wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group has currently twenty members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
One, Lady Angelovich.
We're a open group, people come in and go, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or want to join us.
This will be the case of the scheduled day watch of the end of the world on Thursday 20 December 2012 at 21 hours.
This action will take place in Prague in Incheba, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other Czech Republic musicians.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relaxations when the group The Tap Tap " The End of the Canceled World " will be sing together.
The aim of the concert is to raise financial means (25 million CZK) to equip the multifunctional training centre in the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
The price of a ticket at this concert is 400 CZK, the input is free for children up to 12 years, the prevention of the tickets is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was approved as a twentieth member of the Agency, which is the second Member State of the former East block (the Czech Republic has become a member of the whole 12 November 2008).
Poland had started closely with the ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in a number of Agency's projects.
However, the road of Poland to the space has started much earlier.
Before the Second World War, passionate Polandians worked on space flights; they did not always meet understanding.
For example, I would like to refer to the Conference of A. Šternfeld to the Astronomy Observatory of Varsovia on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas of his pre-guard work entitled " Introduction to the Astronautic".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the cold auditors and later, Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his works.
In 1934, Sternfeld obtained in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Astronautic Introduction".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a great propagator of astronautics and astronautics.
He wrote hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote many books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagator of the global astronautic rename, and its contribution was particularly repeated by the fact that his name was given to one of the hidden faces of the Moon.
Since 1925, a drain was built in Poland to be equipped with a fused engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are not known.
It is not even if the fusy should be used to propulse or fresh the dressine.
The only information known about this drain is the press of the time.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to dedicate himself to the zones.
Research was conducted by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in association with Professors Miečislaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrickiego.
It states that this research has reached the test stage.
Of course, with the archae of the German army, research was interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of a photo-electric chasing area, drawn by the Rohoziński engineer, appeared in the specialized press, and the next year was the work "Rakieta - torpeda poına i raketobomba lotticz" of a author named Leliwy-Kriwoblocki.
These two projects finally had a military use of fuses engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of the fuses technology were conducted by the provisional Advisory Scientific Committee (Doradczo-Naukowy) which coordinated all travels.
This committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other travels dedicated to the aircraft were held in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautic Society.
For the first time, it is questioned of a company in November 1954 of the Problem Journal, in which four more detailed articles are dedicated to the aircraft.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to the astronautic
At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been the same and it was that the area of space research had the future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) has made efforts to enter the international astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and since the future, the PTA has become a regular member of it.
The following year, the first President of the PTA, Kaziméd Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became President of the International Astronautic Federation.
He kept his function until he died in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has contributed significantly to the coronated development of the RM weather fuse (Rakieta Meteorologicczna), which has become the first Polish Fusion to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch was held on 10 October 1958.
This fusy of a 1800 meters he had a length of 80 cm and weighted a little less than 5 kg.
Then a improved version, RM-1A, was built and, during the sea of 1959, two streets RM-2 flight tests were started in the Bledov desert.
This fusy had a length of 1.4 meters and probably weighted 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to perform specific scientific travels - the RM-34 fusy had to have a port of up to 14,5 km and used to observe the wind in the height.
But in 1963, all development works were stopped.
The Meteor-1 fusy set for the period 1962-1965, followed by the first RM fuses.
This fusy, constructed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and a initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (named Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the sizes of the space reserved to scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A fuse had a space with a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litres and 0.62 litres in Meteor-1C.
The maximum rate of all these types of engine was 37 km.
In the 1965 - 1968, the Meeor-2 fuses were placed in the aircraft, and the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 area had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a useful burden of 10 kg at approximately 60 km height.
Then the versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a CoSPAR national committee two years later.
In the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in spatial exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second non-soviet cosmonaute of this programme after Vladimir
The abrogation of the law on useful travels is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court has cancelled the law on useful travels.
This decision raised a living discussion in the opinion.
There is no doubt an interest in considering this problem in a broader viewpoint.
The economic systems oriented to liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This specifically means that different economic entities and national economic systems are permanently in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of freedom of trade and freedom of private capital associated with a frauded financial speculation.
Great differences in the work price (salaries) generate a pressure on prices.
The following must be set out: a producer strives by importing lowly sold goods to resist the economic competition by " making the cost of the competitor, in order to remove a larger part of the market and thus make its own benefits.
In large scale, this means for most undertakers: transfering production to the foreign, buying to low prices, or disappearing. The result is an important unemployment in countries where the prices of work are high in comparison with other economics.
Since the private capital has no responsibility for social views and also for the purpose of unemployment that it is born, the social charges of the State are necessary to increase.
All of this situation intensifies the perfect wrong will of the employees to pay taxes and thus to acquire economic and social damage caused by the company by this course to benefit.
This situation is in such a notority point that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
In the various economys, non-scrouped practices of private capital cause a situation in which the governments of different countries are obligated to run into mutual competition in order to decrease the social level of their own population in order to attach the foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments make their own population grateful to the private capital without taking into account the social disadvantage.
This appears mainly in the amendments to the present law.
The objective is to emphasize its own population economically to accept the dictate of private capital prices, in particular in the field of salaries.
This is a part of a system of economic restrictions in the case of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, by restricting the rights of the loans in the field of work legislation.
This results in growing poverty and increasing differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, there are years of food distribution points for poor people that cannot be subject to their own needs.
The number of these people is already counted for millions.
In the context of the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes extremely coherent that the salaries receive such salaries that the State seems to pay a supplement to achieve the vital minimum.
For example, such scandal has been updated in the case of salaries working as assistants to the Federal Parliament.
The economic measures of practically all southern EU Member States, without doubt, generate an analogue situation in which, under the pressure of a disastrous society, people are obliged to immigrate (as in the 19th century), or to live with misfortune salaries, in terms of society, in the hope that the private capital one day invests in their country.
Here we need to ask: Where will this capital come from?
If there comes from other EU countries, poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come anymore, or then a Chinese, a Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Marocian, a Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also involves the whole Latin America.
The liberal theory and media claim that the State cannot invest in its own economy, which leads to economic disaster.
Private capital defenses the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy by regular interventions.
We must then ask ourselves whether the private capital does not influence and, even today, does not guide its own selfish interests, politics, and by the same way, the whole State.
The answer to this question is no doubt yes.
The evidence is that there is a practically powerful lobby and present in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the field of corruption, by providing mutual benefits in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not penaltyable.
In the RFA, the situation is that, due to the lack of financial means, national ministers delegate the development of law projects to lawyers' cabinets closely related to industry.
These legislative drafts are then adopted in the Bundestag.
The entire power is not from the people, as stated in the Western Constitutions, but of powerful financial groups serve their own interests.
It is evident that the democracy oriented to liberalism now is quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book "the crisis of the Roman empire at the time of Caesar and of Pompea": "The State has long been in full dilemma and the functions were assigned by violence.
Put-de-vine coups, illegally obtained benefits, and stones and swords were also used for these posts.
The sub-table and corruption would proliferate without limits and the people would have come to elections with already sold voices" ... "The honest people were never looking for functions, it resulted once the State remained 8 months without consules."..."There was actually started to say that the medication to this difficult situation was autocratic and that it had to choose a powerful man"... It is true that Appians had the spirit of Pompea, but it was Caesar who was irreversiblely transforming the democracy into absolutist regime.
Finally, as in ancient times, the current company is based on the preference of personal benefits, without regard to the interest of the company in its own.
In its existence, the private capital is no longer able to understand and make the interests of the company in it.
This results today, as previously, a deepness without the elite, without any effort to implement deep reforms.
We therefore need to look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and steadfast regimes in liberalisation without scrupules of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th century.
In the current state of things, the disappearance of these systems can be considered for the benefit of liberal democracy as a kind of pause before a new step.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human life, the humanitarian and social crisis that we are today, as well as crimes against mankind as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The abrogation of the law on useful travels is not a solution, at least a long-term solution.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international and at the internal level of Europe, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to reduce the population's social level.
This trend is actually systemic.
The solution consists of sociopolitical reforms, which will strengthen State capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weak the position of private capital monopol in the company for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos lab.
"Nothing will come out of violence and never will be able," says Sting in the Fragile song whose main verse of the refrain is "not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be no," said Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his death bed in 1849.
Following the last vague of violence between Israel and the Gaza band, such as usual, many reactions have occurred.
Some take the part of Israel, arguing about his right to self-defence and putting the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, calling on the racism of Israel, genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I don't want to think about the question of knowing who is guilty and who is victim in his renewed murder wages; all of the people of Israel, including those in the autonomous territory, are born in this political situation and have not seen the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer to readers a "back the ride" point of view on those who are mainly benefiting from pressures that have been lost for more than 95 years (without the Balfour statement in 1917) in a small band of Middle East countries.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available in the study, others are of my own understanding of it, or more precisely of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events in the modern history.
The history of mankind is first the story of a fight for power.
At every time, we can find a Alexandre the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is to know whether these individualities acted independently or whether they dealt with their acts at the throne to someone who was conducting their acts according to specific objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when the world riches are held between the hands of some individuals and that this financial concentration that produces certain powers has not been able to do during one generation.
Among the families astronomic wealth is particularly distinguished by the Rothschild family, which could be considered as the head of the stone (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
It is little written about them.
Of course.
Since the 90s of the 19th century, they received the first World Press Agency (Reʹs) to end the establishment of links between their names and serious acts of elsewhere to which they were mixed and who had always signed for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They have major participations in nearly the majority of the world's central banks and prepare or carry wars against countries in which they have no such participations yet (before Afghanistan's invasion, the number of these countries was seven after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the invasion of Kadhafi only 4, Russia placed the Russian Central Bank under the control of the Russian Government).
Everyone who tried to stand against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln repeated the central bank status at the Bank of America of Rothschild and began to expire his own money during civil war (governmental, I do well) and was in a theater in 1865.
JFK started to educate their own money and wanted to solve the FED, he was disabled in 1963, Mr. Louis McFadden was empoisoned in 1936 while he wanted to make a trial against the FED for the deterioration of the great economic crisis of 1929.
In the 1859 to 1871, their world power suit led to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a 33-degree franc-making, which was the highest level.
The first war had a goal of eliminating the large statistical monarchies in Europe, the second had to remove colonialism, including the British, and the third should reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individus (a number of such servants is sufficient for their luxe and comfort), creating a unique universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing but the start of such a solution) and finally obtaining an absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads Rothschild is to create a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chaos - the order following the chaos).
These solutions are fake and are always leading to an increasing situation (see the creation of the FED to avoid repeating crises as they caused in 1907).
After succeeding the first world war by the inheritance in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsbourg at Austro-Hungrian throne, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia by providing Bulgarian revolution.
The First World War ended brushfully by a German capitalization without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and it was followed by Austria-Hungria, Central Europe's power.
For a easier departure of the Second World War, the bans left the politicians to create a lost conflict situation: they, on the other hand, imposed to Germany of Pharisees war reparations that thus generate the conditions of radicalisation of the mass of applauded mass (after them enough to place a sufficient energy leader, showing the finger of the guilty, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of various nationalities, including a strong German minority that had to play the role of the fifth column to put the powder and deploy a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the sionist movement, which one of them encouraged the creation of a Jewish State, a preference in the history of Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The above statement of Balfour placed the foundations of a massive migration to Palestine and the first fractions with the Arabic local population as they did.
Terrorist acts were done on the other side and on the other side.
The Second World War was evacuated; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international banks held it initially; or if everything he had done was planned, however, the fact is that the souffrances of Europe's concentration camps create the bases of the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; as the war reparations imposed in Germany were from the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel was aligned with an inflammation house that could cause a third world war.
If international bans arise to start this war, the Jewish population will be like it during the Second World War, the first victim of fighting, this time as the Arabic or general Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a large labor, the source of discourse and chaos, not only in this country, but at international level (he suffices to see how people divorce themselves between partisans and defenses of Israel).
Who is guilty and victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a mistake causes another torture is an unfinished circle of violence and where, in the origin of all, the cupidity of some individuals and their desire to gain power over the world?
There is a difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as we are with us, international bans offer people the elections only to their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascising, loyal politicians with regard to international bans, which makes everything in order to execute a war with Iran, which could, due to the accession of this country to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (Chine, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) spread to become a global conflict and because Iran controls the Ormuz detriment through which it transites 20% of the world oil (the naval corridor has only 2 miles) and leads to a destruction of the world economy.
Under which light now appears the words made by David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and servants.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a pound of aristocrats of the finance.
A world in which every newborn seems to be implanted at birth a electronic puzzle that makes it a completely controlled being.
"Let all individuals, small and big, rich and poor, free and servants, carry on the hand or front a brand on the red iron, so that he cannot buy or sell him who does not carry the name of this feroce beast or the number of his name.
We need to understand: that the one who has a good sense has the numbers of this feroce beast.
This number draws the man and it's six hundred sixty-six."
The Argo movie: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a multitude of manifestants composed of islamist students took the American Ambassador of Teheran and rented 52 diplomates.
They should be released in exchange of Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after revolution, had fled to the United States, who had supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the US positive outcome administration, but it could not actually leave Shah, because it would have severely distorted the confidence of its aliens in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had been deployed on the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not able to free the otage.
It was a hard hit for the pressure of the United States, even later aggravated by the fiasco attempt to free the otage by force.
The sequestrated diplomats finally were released 444 days later, after negotiations organized by the Algerian Government.
Their trial leads to the United States a vague of solidarity and an anti-Iranian feeling.
The Iranian debt contributed strongly to Jimmy Carter's defect against Ronald Reagan to the presidential elections of 1980.
The Argo movie, of the actor and scanner Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory to America.
Just before she was busy, six employees disappeared from the ambassador.
After complex events, they were located in the residence of Canada's ambassador.
In connection with the Canadian authorities, the Canadian authorities could make them out of Iran through a rocambolic cover: they left the country with Canada's passengers as members of a tourning team to make repairs for the tourning of a large-scale film.
Genre Combination
Tony Mendez's exfiltration expert plan requires Hollywood's exhibition.
In order to make the more creditable, specialized magazines have made a statement of this film project, press conferences were organized and a ficticial production company and real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, since the film was based on Tony Mendez's memories.
The Affleck movie is a insolite combination of several types.
It is a part of a political thrilling designed in realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful hit, a trailer - such as, for example, in Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen trilogy.
ambitions occur: Sequences of Teheran of documentary sequences (in subtitle sequences are presented iconic photographs of the events' time and the way these photographs retranslated the same situations in the film, there are no large differences)
more and more of Hollywood, treated with ironie and a little exhaustion,
and then scenes of the general quarter of the ○ and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around the conference tables, in the collars and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded to rename his career in a fair way.
A ridiculed actor, he became a respected scene player and his actor's game stopped to raise ironic comments.
Argo is its third long-medium after the "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and thrilling "The town" (2010).
It is also the first Affleck movie that doesn't take place in his original city, Boston.
The sense of a place's atmosphere is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also shows this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Teheran "is taken" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are running in streets during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the ambassade is impressive by its clarity, which also suggests confusion and invisibleness when suddenly, at a given place, is written a history page.
Affleck and its operators have an analogue effect on the fiction scenes (the fake tourning team in the Teheran baser).
Too many actions too many places
The scene player had to be satisfied with a subject that offered only a few palpitant scenes, in the meaning of the term.
It is very well, it sometimes reacts to reality and there, the result is not always even legitimate (the scene in which the crisis threat at the Airport of Teheran is removed by a phone coup in America and the follow-up on the landing track is sufficiently cut off by hair).
The weakness of Argo resides in its dismissed character, due to the need to show too many events at too different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are truly charming in their role of hollywoodian co-operators, their persons would have deserved a larger place and they are not, far away, the only in this case.
The Affleck movie misses a little dramatic pressure, it leaves it to see with a moderate interest, appreciating the performance and retraction of the 70s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story yet, in a certain way, unfinished at this day, and as an illustration of the exagered character of the representation of secret services as all-powerful and all-scients, he is doing the matter.
Rules for breaking balls, bananas and circles
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who is conducting an annual investigation on the most absurd costs, has now decided to launch the concurrence of the regulation or ideas from the most absurd EU atelier.
"The fact that the EU intends, in recent times, to adopt a 40 per cent of women for the leading of the large European undertakings, was from the origin of our decision," said for the journal Pravo, Patrik Nacher.
Of the absurdities mentioned, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, women were prejudiced to the insurance tariffs of life because they represented, objectively, a less risk for insurance companies.
People can signal to the end of the year any other incredible idea of "the EU's athleter".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nader informed.
In the EU's conflicted regulations, for example, the obligation is to acquire bio components for fuel, which has damaged environmental consequences, or the prohibition of use of mercure trusted terms only because they contain a relatively low quantity of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of the powder chains, which caused the egg price to be embraced.
Criticals have also been issued by the past against the prohibition of using the expression "bear to tarting" or the return of the sale of classic ampoules.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 metres.
The European administration is often responsible for the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose requests are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (a.k.a. the Czech Republic currently imposes requests from its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups, for example, are because of the fact that the bananas in the Union should not be less than 14 cm or have a "anormal curve".
The European Commission was defended by argumenting that it was only to harmonize non-homogenal national standards that complied with trade.
The standards regarding fruit and hours have been sustained, despite the opposition of certain States, claim that existing directives cause food gap.
The first price can be determined in this investigation in the EU Regulation of the last year, which must be indicated on a warning that children of less than 8 years should not go up without adult monitoring.
The EU has referred to an American investigation that the balls are the first cause of children's death by heat among players.
Similar restriction applies to children less than 14 years of age to suffle in fever trumpets.
In our home too, we have strange ideas.
The following rule on European officers themselves is quite absurd: due to the importance of this topic for Greece, any person who has an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedone" and must, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslavia of ○a).
In addition to certain absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the Czech Republic has been appointed in this investigation.
The EU had fixed maximum volumes for food reservations that could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for conserved champions and, in fact, a serious amendment.
Organizators of this investigation have considered interesting the idea of paying money to some countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to request grant of subsidy.
However, these ideas are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a marine disappointment.
We are going to ask the European Union a refund." This is how the Ministry of Agriculture of the Day of Jaroslav Palas (CSSD) expressed at August 2004.
It claimed that, because of our production of vegetables, and after the purchases referred to as "interventionists", the State had been found with full stocks that he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU had to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far away from the ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organized an invitation to purchase of cereals from countries without maritime access.
Subventions for the obtaining of subventions have been proposed to the communes by the Ministry of Local Development, managed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), which are particularly used to edit requests for subventions granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "The unusual regulations are rare."
If the regulations often are critical in the Member States, many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the functionality of the Union as well as in the field of its general development deserve awareness.
For example, experts, the problem of the use of EU subventions for projects that have nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States during budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, as in other Union countries, is due to the right to use specific names for these traditional products (whose fight it is not always victory) leads to living emotions in the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of fight against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs have successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvaråky" for the name "Tuzemski rum" that arose with us in the 19th century, our producers have made it replace by the name "Tuzemak".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, not based on bone sugar, can be given the name of rhum.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, it is found today in company of fromages worldwide known as la Feta or le Gorgonzola, le massepain de Lübeck or du jambon de Parme, les biscuits de Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suary"), the carpes de Pohorélice et de Trüboň ("Pohorélisk a Trébońský capr") and le houblon de Žatec ("Jatecky chmel").
The pan d'épice de Pardubice ("Pardubic pernik") and the gâteaux called "Cornets de Horríce" ('Horrische trubičky') can also be proud of their Community mark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Mr Senator, how do we have the idea of presenting the presidential elections?
It's not to be a Senator or a president who counts for me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not be candidate anywhere.
But I have no longer supported to see how the country has been pillared since the last 20 years, that the furnaces are not under the locks and taxes and the age of the departure has grown.
I had no ambition to become political.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to make a solution to change it.
And as I have more than forty years and I am independent, member of no party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation than to present me to the presidential or senatoral elections.
You have entered the Senate but you have quickly traveled to the Castle (N.D.T.: presidency seat).
Do you not turn your back to those who chose you?
I always said I'd run in the battle for the Castle.
Then I pointed out that if I was a senator, I would be presented to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, this is only a tool that allows me to perform my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the widest mandate.
The problem is not only as a nation we are moving to the bar or before our television station, but it is also that we pitch all those who are trying to make changes.
This is the press that breaks the reputation of people and confunds the freedom of words with freedom of lying.
For example, it was stated that I suspected the journalists or that I was the adviser of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You have started the fight for the Castle with the subjects of the material and penal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax statements beyond twenty million [of CZK].
You have to change the law for this purpose.
As the President, you do not have such power and only the Senat in its own may offer laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I was a citizen, I pressed for tourist guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained a lot of cause.
The problem is political: when someone comes from the left or right with a good project, this is wisely delayed and it delays the citizens.
As independent, member of no party, I have much more opportunities to support all Parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without category and partisans dogma, to take from each party what is better for our country and implement it.
Do you view yourself as a man on the right or on the left?
From a check point, I have the impression that people put me at the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we're going before.
What matters for me is not that people are left or right, but to raise people.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the party's or ODS, and I also act impartially against bad ideas.
Do you worry when someone tells you that you're a popular?
But what you said isn't proof of what you said?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and a view.
You're trying to get close to it.
Some may call this popularism, but all the proposals I speak have been applied by the world and reconciled experts have spoken of it.
But without the support of the parliament, you have only slogans.
You will not survive a long time in politics with this.
Do you think if you're going to see people and talk to them, you'll, for example, succeed in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and opinions and try to raise them to my camp to impose it.
If I was elected by the President, it would not be a problem to directly translate my request to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officers, judges and prosecutors.
They should then explain why they do not want it.
When there will be a strong personality that will identify abuse, it will be possible to press on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president in direct subsequence, was obtained by the pressure of the opinion.
I admit, without packs, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find alias for my opinions and visions.
I just started in politics and tryed to support the majority of my programme.
I'm trying to make things progress alone, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and return to the private sector.
It's like Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a saver.
I know that one person can't distinguish, so I've gone to see a number of personalities to ask them to be presented to the Senatoral elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he did because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the investigation journalist Jana Lorencová, who revealed frauds to maout.
I've been presented because people are really mad, but now I'm exciting.
Seventy percent of people did not vote and, mostly, they gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In Senat, we are only two independents.
People have chosen a Senate that can hardly make changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the election to the direct suffrage of the Majors and the Prefects of the Regions.
Are you thinking to fund your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if the past of each potential member is insufficient and then I don't have the financial means.
I have no money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my "transparency" account.
You don't have money?
You're talking about tax statements, what's yours?
I consider about 60 million the value of my personal property.
I have a land of 25 million in Prague, a apartment of a value of ten million, another apartment of 8 million value, a collection of art works of approximately 10 million, a Aston Martin value of 3.5 million and a Superb Schkoda of a value of 1 million and a few million on my account.
Or saying, I've got a Aston Martin, because it was a dream: I've always loved James Bond, who was running in a car, was driving with women and standing against evil and abuse.
You're rolling in Aston Martin, you have a 60 million inheritance and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but don't you want to invest your own money there?
It's not very convinced.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I have to do it?
I've already invested 2 million and half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my programme is not a great interest.
I don't have the obligation to pay this campaign of my pocket.
My campaign costs are globally covered by the remuneration that I will receive as senator.
But I couldn't live it, for example, pay the English oil of my son who costs 30 thousand per month.
If my only goal was to win money, I wouldn't be present to any choice.
So you're going to continue your business activities to be able to live?
Didn't you say that you'd put your activities in the middle?
But this is not linked to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partly reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take the leading of the travel agency at first.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
Yet, I need to live for something.
What was your normal monthly salary when you were undertaken?
I won and continued to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was the president, I would end my business activities.
You will find this interview in the Saturday Edition of the Prava Journal.
The MVRDV cabinet teachers prove that the real aventuries are not only imagination case. To convince it, it suffices to contemple Spijkenisse and the newly built books mountain - 2 photos
"I think that this building is funny, it makes it very futurely, finally something interesting in seeing," said Lisette Verhaig, a guardian on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, an informatic in a large neighborhood company, said to us, "Yes, he's really good, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, a iPad and e-books.
Today, no one's going out of his full pleasure in one of these fingerprint libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a village who has nothing to draw at Rotterdam's gates, has a very special record.
The 80,000 community shows the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fiction points on the euro billets in the form of small wall-screen miniatures.
The success of the cultural obfence remains limited.
So the city authorities realized that there was only one way to recover the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, of Rotterdam MVRDV architects office, master of arrogant graphics and creator of full and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with its usual flegma and presented himself at the concurrence in 2003 with five books under the arm and a recycling on the face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at, concerning and exhausting the ears, Maas, faced, used his choice books by order to make it a pyramide, and finished its staged speech of active arguments by one: "Common love!"
Here's my proposal for the Mount of Books of Spijkenisse, or as it is said, Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros was landed.
The building is included in a revitalisation project which also includes a subterrane Parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few immobile houses and mitoyen houses for a total of 50 rooms.
Beginning November, the books mountain received the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
Furthermore, the project was selected for the National Wood Award 2012.
This small neck bourgade, which had nothing to offer until now only a post-modern petroleum area and a magic of a growing laid, whose white façades are invited to think that they broke a latter, has been rich with a contemporary textural work.
The most important is that Spijkenisse has now the first public culture building of his history.
The long path to reading
First Impression: Eldorado of the book under the cover.
Certainly, an assessor brings you into the heart of the massive, but the real joys of reading and architecture are opened to you when you throw the ground of the building to the covering of his topgraphy.
The inside is completely made of glass, and it is awesome, the ground in netherlands breaches and the legacy reverbs speak without equivalent the language of municipal places.
The city atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for the public, dogs, and little boys and girls playing at the ball.
And all books, books, and more books.
"Normally the library radians are located in the middle of the fascade and in the middle of a large and dark room, which is often inconfortable and inpersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We completely broke the classic space configuration and open the internal reading spaces to the outside.
The inside of the Mount of Books was properly threatened: in the middle of the offices, the Internet library, the failure club, the environmental centre and the technical centre of the building.
A special beauty resides in the black radians of the library, which are soon lambs, so much balustrades, so much scale ramps.
A new experience for viewing, touching it and hatred.
Even the building engineers and engineers do not want inconsistent materials.
"We want to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project at the Spijkenisse community, in an answer to the Standard.
So we found one day in a fresh agricultural company a ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, the synthetic membrane has been used for years of a milemeter of spacing as substrate in the stars and fields.
It's a good market, and we won time.
The membrane end is used during one or two seasons, then we can throw it out.
For the library, the membrane was compressed for the first time in such quantities, in places of a wide range of four metres.
Under the effect of the heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resident material, which the odor refers to both a new car and sports chaussures.
The top of the 105 walks is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary coffee offers us a impressive view of the city, but also Hollandic croquets and powder figs.
They create a atmosphere, but especially contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new
"It's incredible, but despite all glass surfaces, this building is a model project in the field of ologie," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermia.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass cloud, the sun is just a little time inside, even the beautiful days of time.
Powder in woods monted by crossing compared to glass fascade serves of pass-sol, intercepting a large part of the radians.
Environmental atmosphere is very pleasant.
The totally automaticized storages are loaded from the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the sectical informant mentioned, has already been risked to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, Chinese traditional medical professor, even describes Boekenberg as "the finally found" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, each citizen was invited to give a book out of his personal library.
This measure allowed to complete the empty library that was not yet completely garnie (that is now, it counts 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
Rayons are all over.
For Winy Maas architect, "There is nothing worse than a half-level library."
"I believe our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has reached the mastership discipline called "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new literary history page.
Even if she can seem young and little educated.
It is finally a new point of department for the birth of a identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose the abstention in voting on the adoption of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert of relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin into a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of the Palestinians to observe State status in the United Nations.
But then she chose the abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelites did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must prove to be acknowledged because it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think she doesn't even support the American position.
Germany wanted to state its independence, however, without being too critical to Israel.
During the insurance in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose the abstention in voting on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, the NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany experience difficulties to adopt a positive position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is revising its external policy, seeking to remove from a policy that is defined by the Americans and establishing a German foreign policy.
Furthermore, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complies with the situation.
Therefore, the Germans are in a number of fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not used there.
I think they are still appealing to find this role, but they are on the way of a "meer normal foreign policy".
External policy, such as France or Great Britain
What does the term of "normal" for the Germans significantly mean?
It shows the will of adopting independent positions of the United States and European partners, including national dossiers.
I believe that the German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and relations with certain regions such as Russia, China or the Near East.
The German economic interests are, in a certain way, different from those of the other large powers: therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position of Germany against the conflict in the Near East and the abstention of the United Nations vote?
Germany has a significant place in the Middle East, especially in the Golf countries.
That is why Berlin must take care of not to earn the opinion, but also the elite in Arab countries.
There is no doubt a determining element.
However, I would not give it too much importance because it is not a single-lateral relationship.
But this is, in any case, a determining element in the German strategic reflections.
Did Germany note its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and the Americans understand the German position perfectly.
That is why I think the fraction is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
In fact, Germany showed that it should be taken seriously as a international actor and that its interests should be taken into account.
In Europe, the opinions on the Palestinian initiative are different.
However, the United States announced their veto by a vote.
Do the opinions distinguish between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences due to the American internal policy scene.
I believe that Obama's administration is secretly aware of a great understanding of the European position.
However, because of the political construction of the country, the Government can not listen to defense its position.
I think the real differences of opinions are not so big that they always look like it.
If you observe the relationships between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will note that Obama is far away from enthusiasm with the Netanyahou policy.
Does Germany experience difficulties to consolidate its close relationship with Israel and the United States, on the other hand, with the position of the large European partners, on the other hand?
I don't think that's easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but this is not the case today.
Therefore, they cannot enter into a larger political line and must confirm their single position.
That's what they do now in the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will in the future have a lolomotive role and will motivate Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not simple for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicated.
But myself, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that marks more their independence.
See Germany playing a role of weight actor on the international scene, would Germany only want a key role?
Or does she always have difficulties to play roles in the first plan?
Germany is still not used there, it is always uncomfortable to him and, for clear reasons, the country still experiences difficulties to play a more important role.
If, for example, we look at the euro crisis, we note that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
This doesn't make things easy for the Germans.
In fact, it is still the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In this regard, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must compose with very different neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European Policy only reduces, but at this moment, the EU does not fill this empty, then who remains?
The Germans will just have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unappreciable to them and if they're just less appreciated, it's life!

"Protection of Marks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known marks throughout the world.
Armani Polo... what's it really about?
After that name, a mark officially placed in China is hidden, but there is nothing to see with the original company.
The mark thus plays a protection such as the company who holds the name may not complain.
And even if she could, it's not sure she'd get some cause.
"It is more difficult for foreigners to protect their marks in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the Taylor Wessing cabinet in violation of the right of property in extreme-East.
Each week, a new record comes on my office.
The imitators only need some additional letters to be able to record their marks.
Thus, instead of Gu, Lu-Gu is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also copied in any way, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sport articles.
Pattloch opens a classifier in which records are recorded at the Pekin Marks Office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company presented the mark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm was artificially created by adapting a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the mode house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese became the champions of the world of the copy and violation of the intellectual property.
In the largest cities, commercial centres are found at several stages that sell practically only contraventions.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his hands are the charger to attack the fact that the Chinese Marks office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name already protected in another country.
The Chinese are talking about "Bang Mingpai", parent mark.
The term is from "Bang Dakuan".
That is with this term the women who are married to rich men.
The Chinese authorities say that they have nothing to regret.
"It's bad for businesses, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch requests.
"The mark is edulcorated, the singularity disappears, the disappointments for the reputation are great."
Financial losses and the costs of justice are counted in millions for the sectors concerned, especially in the case of cost-period products.
According to the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual amount of EUR 15 billion, the third world market for luxe products and the most rapidly developing.
However, it is not easy to radiate doubt records of the marks record and these procedures cost deep.
The latests may take up until nine years, and the output is never certain.
Pattloch stated the proceedings in which the Court rejected the complaint, since after a long time, the criticized name became a "market reality".
Pattloch explains us that if the complainant doesn't have chance, he may even be required to pay money to the plagier, because he would have been naked to his mark in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also relate to graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the Sany Chantier Machine Manufacturer, the same company who had just sold the Putzmeister pump manufacturer.
That's why Chinese can use an emblem that is nothing to the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's accommodator, used before a blue and white logo that reminded the BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely did it.
The Lacoste Mode House had lost against Hong Kong and Singapore plagiers who had reoriented the famous crocodile view in the opposite direction.
According to Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO Marks office in Pekin admits that there are some difficulties in 2010 due to lack of personal and space.
However, the office would have spent the last year of a "needs situation in the work at a found normality".
Thus, the number of non-treated opposition procedures would have been decreased by 22%.
Approximately 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the year.
However, 81.500 procedures remain in souffrance at the office.
Make total costs
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million mark deposit applications, almost one third of more than 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consequently in the head of the classing for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also be worth the total number of brands, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have calculated 1.8 billion yuan register rights.
In other words, each registration reported in average EUR 1,280 yuan, or EUR 160.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrates the case of the German family company joynberg.
Since more than seven years, the company struggled against a Chinese plagier.
Certainly, the Germans were able to suspend the illegal manufacture of vehicle components.
However, the imitator could maintain its Chinese rights on the joynberg mark.
"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, president of the Guide of joynberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Office of Marks had therefore rejected the objection of the Munichois.
The joynberg has obtained certain cause winning at the following two instances, but the side side continues to be up to today.
Watching is set up
Today, the case is at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive issue of the proceedings and benefits from the professionalism of judges.
However, he says: "The procedure is long, testing and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to evaluate the internal costs. The archive service had even to have been revised in the past hundred years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, gladnberg had even proposed an "great amount of euros to six digits" in vain to the opposite party.
"This is what it represents for us," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the extreme East are even threatening to overcome Europe.
It would be if imitators of this region would ensure the exploitation of non-protected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to put the name of gladnberg in Germany for a chain and cow production company.
The company has long abandoned this sector, but it has even been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler: "Watching is in place."
Pattloch and Pattloch advise the German companies to demonstrate a great tendency in their commercial relations with China.
It does not suffice them to trust in the international law of trade marks, but foreigners should, rather, "record in China all that is possible to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much more important than those of the recording.
In fact, if gladnberg lost the battle during the last act of its legal drama, the company should pay licence rights to the opposite party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or then we will lose our place on the market segment.
World day of fight against AIDS: foottapper, song, help
Imbongi's coral repeated in Heidelberg, and Swaziland's sida orphelins enjoy their arrival.
This is the story of a link that is far more than a distance of 8.733 km.
On the top, the foot is tapped: the cowboy bottles, the baskets, the scorpines for ladies and the mucasines for men seek the rythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the songs are slowly enhanced - high, low, tenor, and superno - they take up, send and follow.
Fiete Hopf, 29-year-old orchestra head, almost loses his toilet chaos when he leads the orchestra with his gestes of a wildness.
We are Monday evening, the choral Imbongi repeat a new song in the Music Room of the Heidelberg Medical Psychology Institute.
Five songs and songs from 23 to 69 years came from the genetic in hum's medical to human home.
"Om'Obani" is not a easy song, each chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: Zulou, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some regions of Swaziland.
Helping to help
UNUSIDA, the United Nations AIDS fighting programme, considers that 34 million people around the world are affected by disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland counts 245,000 infected people.
Furthermore, more than 40% of the population are serious.
180 orphelins from the village of Esitani found partainers in Germany through the "Voices for Africa".
70 of them are often a secondary educational establishment.
For at least 15 or 20 euros, it can be a parish.
This sum guarantees the child of money for oil, a school uniform and a hot hot food at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in zolo "History stories" or also "Peace-calender".
No one can hardly speak the bantuous language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
Since approximately 10 years, the coral has repeated songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany for now to return it to its country: South Africa.
Because at 8.733 km from Heidelberg flight in the Northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, Esitzeni is the village that depends on the voice of the German cronal power.
40% of people reached
The village accounts about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modesty pair or earth hooks, and most of them are children.
More than 300 are orphans, because HIV has brought their parents.
At Esitani, we can observe the worst degree that accumulates Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life hope in the world.
The population is almost never accepting the male circumcision, a measure which, however, guarantees a reduction in the risk of half infection.
More than 40% of the Swaziland population are portrayed by immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to be in the middle of the 30th.
During a group travel to Africa in the early 2005, the coral could have discovered the village. The Imbongis saw particularly many children in the street, not only parents' care, but also simply all: food, clothing, education.
In a poor, without school diploma, there is no good perspective.
At the beginning, it was only a few people who personally engaged in paying a few euros each year to be able to send a child to the oil and offer him a hot food daily.
But almost a year later, the coral was based on "Voices for Africa", a dictionary who has been busy in the nearly professional way of the Side of Estoni.
Does on sexually transmissible infections
What are the most corrosive sexually transmissible diseases?
Among the veterinarian ISTs, the syʹlis, the chlamidiates and the blannorragie (or gonorhee) are counted.
The core ISTs are HIV, human papilome virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubis and galle pounds belong to parasite ISTs.
What are mainly the groups concerned?
Syʹlis and blannorgy often appear in men who have sexual relations with others.
The Institute Robert-Koch considers that sexual contacts between men are from at least four cases of syʹlis on five statements in Germany.
In hetherosexual adults, infections associated with chlamydiates, trichomonase, candidose (fongic), blennorragia and human papilome virus are coronerated sexually transmitible diseases.
The rate of HIV propagation among hetherosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, about 20% of the new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In youths, a rate of infections related to chlamydiates is sensitively higher than in other population groups.
According to European reliefs, the three quarters of all infections relate to young people of age 15 to 25.
Moreover, in Germany, the human papilome virus is running among young people.
What is the development of the number of infections?
It is not obligatory to declare all sexually transmissible diseases.
According to the Institute Robert-Koch, the number of syılis cases had more than doubled in 10 years: the number passed from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been reduced.
In 2011, about 2.700 cases.
This is a decrease of a tenth compared to the year.
What are the symptoms of sexual illness?
Infectional diseases may cause abces to the level of genital organs, urinary pain, white losses, low-wind pains, and the appearance of buttons and steel.
However, they are not regularly training any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect to 100%.
The reason is that the pathogenic agents of sexually transmissible diseases may also be transmitted by lubricant infection or by heavy body contacts.
Experts therefore recommend to every person who often changes from sexual partners regularly.
Most rapidly depicted ISTs can be healthy and late sequences can be avoided.
Thanks to the parkings, gifts, but especially the funds that the chorists collect through their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulated.
"We have already sent approximately 200,000 euros to Esitani," says Annette Lennartz, president of the.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well located, for example, with one of their grandmothers.
Gogos, so they are called old women in zolou, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them gather up to 14 orphelins, they offer them a tower and ensure that they enter each day in their uniforms.
The orphelin that no longer has anyone is accepted in a safe place, with Khanyisil, a woman living alone and is paid by it, as both kitcheners preparing them each day for more than 200 hungry children.
Furthermore, "Voices for Africa" has created a cutting school and allowed the building of two pupilers. With the concurrence of the American PSI health organization, the ® has organized a HIV depisting test for many people.
This doesn't care for itself, for even if the disease is well-away throughout the country, it remains a tabou subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"The AIDS is a real tabu," explains Annette Lennartz, "for it is a subject that touchs sexuality."
It's quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his life’s ability.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These sanctions by the State, among other things, are responsible for the rapid development of HIV in recent decades.
Migrating workers have also distilled the virus throughout the country.
However, there are preservatives at each road corner, Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, meat against flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, Imbongi's chorists are traveling every two or three years in South Africa and playing songs of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many residents of the point of black continent still know about the time of the apartheid.
The bus filled with whites that sing in African language is a sign of Propertyness such as it produces not only good humor and joy, but sometimes also draws a larry to some disturbable border guards.
The bus always brings them to Esitani, where the chorists visit their daughters.
Even if it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitani is well known in the valley of E©veni.
"Go to Esitani, you'll find light there," people say there.
And after a travel of 8.733 km/h, returning to Heidelberg, before those corists who pick up their feet in the Bergheimer Street Road Repetition Room, we also find light.
Messenger: NASA covers ice presence on Mercure
The Senate Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice on the Mercure Planet.
The ice bed could reach 20 meters of spring.
The NASA Space Agency proved the existence of ice on the Mercure planet.
Although this planet is the nearest of the sun, it is the ice water, as it explains three studies this Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Sound Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice covering in the area of the planet in the shadow.
This cover would have a depth of at least 30 metres that could go up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from cometes or maybe of asteroides who would have heated Mercure.
However, no one links between the water coverage and the hypothesis of a presentation of life on the planet, explains the scientist head of the Sonde Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercure can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements to life have reached in other regions of the solar system.
Ina imagination of the inhabitants of our planet, sonds, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix explode the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to earth, such as small interstations through which the infinity is observed.
The picture comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the Nain Planet Ceres.
As Pluton, orbiting around the sun behind Neptune, Cerès is not considered as a "planet", the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer Telescope shows an "Family Portrait" of the innumerable generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the rose points, the more difficult to identify, are the "newborn" in the universe's accommodation room.
The Spitzer telescope covered the region where the stars are born, baptized "W5", a very little romantic name in the constellation of Cassiopée at 6.500 years of light.
The NASA's telescope Spitzer photographed the flaming flaming star.
The circle in the form of bagnet is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the vast nebulous Trifide, at 5.400 light years of the Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
Spitzer's telescope photographed this galaxy shopping room.
The Pleiades, stars loves also called "the seven sisters", can be observed at the nudle eye during the night.
However, the telescope makes the colors more valuable.
On this infrared photo, the hell's nebulous, like a red eye, looks directly at the spectator.
It is at 700 light years in the constellation of the Verse.
His similarities with a earthquake have been valuable to him the title of North America.
Combining the normal photo and infrared photo can be observed a spectacular weight.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope could catch a picture of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the largest enigmes of the astronomy is on the creation of Saturne rings.
A theory is that the rings are the rest of a Saturne moon that disappeared 4,5 billion years ago without leaveing tracks.
One of the biggest and lightest photographs that the Hubble telescope has taken is the of the Tourbillon galaxie.
According to the tent, photographs of spirit galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph of the European Australian Observatory shows the Trifid’s nebulous in the constellation of the Sagitator, in several thousands of light years.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divised, divided in three), because three stages of dust divide the heart from the place of birth of the stars.
The astronomes photographed the primes of a cosmic characteristic in the Serpent constellation: at 400 million light years of the Earth, two-fuzing galaxies' novels are predicted one to another, and the inevitable is.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spirit galaxie.
If you don't love technical abbreviations, you can use its "Austral Fire Road".
The photo of the Space Telescope Hubble shows a detail of the Iris nebulous in the constellation of Céphee.
The nebulous is at 1.400 light years and is composed of powder grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic clichés taken by different telescopes.
There you can see the composed circle of black troops, which is 430 million light-years of the Earth.
The spatial telescope photographed the NASA group of baptized galaxies Arp 273.
Scientists called the largest spiral galaxie "GC 1810".
In this nebulous, the youngest stars group of our milk road is located.
The heavenly beach always gives birth to new stars.
These stars clouds, which are connected by the Roset's nebulous, also create youth stars permanently at 5.000 light years of the Earth.
In this galaxie of rayons of a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists think that he was born a little after bigbang, when the universe was composed in large part of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and through them, it was possible to see more far in the universe.
Pengt; 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the telescope Hale of the Watchtower of the Palomar Mount near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
The Binocular Telescope is located in Arianna in the United States.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors with each a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The Grand Telescopio Canarias ventre in La Palma, Canary Islands, is large. The mirror only reaches a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa was segmented to make economics.
The diameter reaches about 11 meters.
The inconvenience of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle level, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle level.
His particularity holds its great ability to collect lights.
Despite a relatively small look diameter, this ability approaches the largest telescope at the world's mirror.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Each owner of a person can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intellectuality") by contributing to the calculation power of its machine.
See the Australian European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), a worthy installation of his name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can light the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also intended for the ESO site in Chile.
His main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of approximately 1.000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clichés before 2018 as soon as possible.
By 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian Vulcan of Mauna Kea were considered the biggest in the world.
They treated two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the observatory of Mauna Kea watching the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IR.
A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows it to be added.
However, the most important images of the space come from the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he gives us pictures from remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the Space Telescope Kepler seeks exoplanets, mainly those who are residents.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that she had found 1.235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This picture illustrates the latest preparations before the Kepler space telescope is launched.
The spatial telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent to the space as soon as 2018 at a Ariane area 5.
The first mirror of the infrared spatial telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will especially be assigned to find light designed by the first stars and galaxies after bigbang.
Scientists think that the South Pool of Mercure also opens ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists because the Messenger is much closer to the North Pool of Mercure.
Radar data have shown the presence of ice on Mercure since decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger sond in 2004, the first orbiting around Mercure, scientists now have the surety.
Drink daily the breast, and live up to 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach deep age of the Bible’s patriarchs.
There's even a long-evited museum.
An investigation on a country in which we are still relatively young to 97 years.

An investigation on a country in which we are still relatively young to 97 years.
Traveling in the Talysh Mounts is of a disastrous romantic.
About the many tourners of the road, the small bus cahotes the long of drunken birds, torrental rivers and modest closes.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the North Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few miles.
This is where the Kazakh ethnic group named Talysh lives, about which we don't know greatly, if it's only that they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and they have a very large long-term.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town of plastic with its too aggressive employment of the Soviet times that does not agree with the pittoresque mountain landing.
European tourists are rare here, the travel from the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is too painful.
We need eight hours to travel 323 km, because the road has only one road.
The province has not yet benefited from the wealth of the country to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Bakou became famous in May through the Eurovision concurrence, and the next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," explains Fatulayeva.
She is guided by the long-evitation museum, the only museum of this kind in the world.
There can be discovered about eight decades of Talysh in the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
Here's my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120 years.
Other children at 136 years of age
But the controversy star of the museum is Shirali Müslümov, a shepherd who was 168 years old.
However, there is no birth act.
And when you think the oldest person documented was 122 years old, Müslümov's age was more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," said Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have made a girl.
Would Shirali Müslümov miss a few decades by calculating his age?
Scholz, gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute of Rostock, also heard him talk about man at the age of Central Asia.
"Astonishment older people live in some regions of China, Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan," explains Scholz, "in Sardinian, there are men who live incrediblely old."
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence because of the existence of documents, unless there was a civil status record.
Each day, a swimming drunk
However, people in Lerik’s region often reach a dignified age of the patriarchs of the Bible.
At present, 20 people are over 100 years old.
What, then, is the reason for long-evitation in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
On the contrary, Fatulayeva, the museum's leader, thinks that it is an issue of food.
However, in a nutritional view, it is not claimable that the rich food in the Talysh calories, who love meat, bread and especially milk products, and whose many drink a daily drunken drunk is good for health.
Or is this the simple life mode that keeps people’s youth? In Cengemiran, a small village near Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
After her 97 years, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest tree house, as it is typical to see it throughout the Caucase region.
She is sitting on the ground near a bart, whose content she hits inlass.
Eight people live here under one shot, among whom one of Mirzayeva's sons and a girl, who have been adults for a long time.
Two small children are also in the house.
In the kitchen, the tea is prepared for the guests used in typical armed glasses in the form of breast.
The white teeth of Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under his foulard they hide long springs of a blonde that his son shows us proudly.
I always wash my hair with milk, and so I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I never used shampooing," Mirzayeva.
The monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own clothing: tomates, pomegranates, and small poisons.
I've never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Then she talks to us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev took the orders.
The tongue of propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the patriarch of the nation, a man who, however, guided his country as a dictator, knew almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was at power until 2003, his son Ilham followed him afterward.
Anyway, the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know distress.
Mirzayeva receives a monthly 230 hands (approximately the same amount as in euros) for its retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life train in the region.
And maybe the son of Mirzayeva has a long-term grissing right: "The elderly enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, careful and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
"Man's rights" missed in the Constitution
Revolution is renewed to Cairo.
Rival manifestations reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The constitutional project based on the charia is violently controversy.
The Egyptian president is not aware of emotional words.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said to the state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but especially for the Christian Cops, the liberals, the muslims, the light and the lake.
Because all the members of the confusion and discouraged opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocratic on the Nil with the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost by excuses, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended its "to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what they want to save this 61-year engineer, a doctorate of the American University of South California.
Will the Judicial power be distorted?
The 234 articles of the assembly, which constitutes the majority of 100 people in a 15-hour nutrient force tour, are actually concerned in a certain measure.
Like in constitutions, the project provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of the Islamic Right".
But what does the word "principes" really mean?
It was and it remained a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that islamists use the vague formulation and the legal manner margin that is covered to apply a more strict interpretation of the charia.
In any case, a new article has been introduced in a statement that, in respect of all the subjects affecting the charia, the University of Al-Azhar must be consulted. The institution is the most important islamic institution of the country and its islamic eclipse on the whole islamic world.
This may, but it does not necessarily mean that the church will monitor the islative device, which would actually lead to the establishment of the judicial authority.
Many points of the Constitution project are to be interpreted
Another problem is the maintenance of military jurisdiction.
Penn't the government of Moubarak, these courts were employed to repair the opposers.
After the dictator's death, up to 11.000 civilians were arrested by military officers.
The State must, too, be read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "the promotion of its moral and values".
In a legal manner, the formulation is so vague that States institutions could even control the contents of cinemagraphy and literature.
He would just act in censure.
Furthermore, no article guarantees expressly the equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibited to defense or spread the prophet Mahomet or his sent ones.
However, the article does not define what is an offence or how it should be punished.
It is so doubtful that the formulation allows us to hear that it is prohibited to "open people".
Is it enough for a carcature of the president or to tell a blame of the detriment of a man of law?
Thus, many points are to be interpreted in the project which Morsi is voting and who will, in its own words, "too soon" make a referendum to the Egyptians.
"Revolution renewed"
The opposition has been mobilised for weeks against the digital surrounding of islamists.
Thursday evening, tens of thousands of manifestants gathered themselves in a consensus on the place of Tahrir in Cair, promised to make the charia fall before it enters into force.
"The revolution renews and we will win," launched Hamdin Sabbahi, reached the third of the presidential elections.
The Nobel Price of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei, stated that the Constitutional project is "building into the powder of the history".
On Twitter, the continuous mailing service, he accused Morsi's parties to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referencendum, we'll go to his palace and reverse it," Jasser Said, an opposite.
"We are not yet fatigued, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated," said the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and member of opposition.
Furthermore, several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referencendum, which would lead to its nullity.
"The Coran is our Constitution"
On its side, the Muslim, well-organized conference, called to a contra-manifestation not at the Tahrir place by precaution, but on the other side of the Nil, where a great prayer was organized before the Caire University.
"The people claim to apply the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, saying, "The Coran was their Constitution."
A fight for the sovereignty on the symbolic place of Tharir, where everything started, would soon have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Of course, that's what Morsi's parties wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers said that the opposers to the Constitution project were expressed highly and strongly.
According to them, it is now time to allow the people to decide by the urnes of the direction that the country must take.
The project of islamists will certainly receive the majority.
"The human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is in anger against this imposed constitutional process that would have had to extend to February and integrate all social forces.
This 48-year human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the courts under Moubarak.
He did not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indigenous.
That's why he was shot, judged and prisoned.
"And now the term is not even spoken once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the World am Sonntag.
The extension of the powers of Morsi to the three powers decorated the lawyer.
These measures are appealing to the rules of democracy and will create a new dictature in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the President has actually removed all its powers," Saeda said.
However, a democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels delayed, including the international community, watching the battle between the various political ideals on the Nil border with a mixing of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid.
A manifester on the Tharir place observes: "You'll get a monster that you're not gonna be able to control."
Norway's crack: is it the most odd fish in the world?
The five million people who people Norway benefit from one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of locals for a extremely odd fish?
Take advanced springs.
Place them in the middle of a pile of foot- and salt-made clothing.
Wait a week.
And you're getting the intriguing odor of the rakfish, one of the most pregnant places in Norway.
I'm in the small city of Fagernes, about 3 hours in Oslo.
It snows, the landing is spectacular - and this, all presently, imprisons the air.
The rakfisk is composed of salt suit and closed in the water for a duration -• the odor you want to exhale - that can go up to a year.
When the darkness is installed and it is cold, the Norwegians race themselves in mass to attend a festival here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality.
"You eat cru, and then you eat a water drink," explains Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local pump that is also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for the festival management.
About us, people wallow out of small fishing songs and swallow a large amount of drinks.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfish," Havard.
The drink kills the worm.
I'm trying some songs.
If you can avoid doing it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk returns to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was spread into air-scale water bars and then sailed in automne.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish went out and - without doubt with the senses of amoindris by the alcohol - eating.
In the general generation, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country to find work, mainly immigrating to the United States.
Now the population is quickly developing - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high salaries and a full health system.
The Swedish, their old countries whose country was there is no longer richer than Norway, crossing the border to come to work.
The rakfish is considered as something important, a vital, although odourable, of the past of Norway.
This is part of the most dear places.
But everything is dear - a small beer painting or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often speak about it in international events, which is not to please her.
Here, people are not ready to talk about Anders Breivik, the extremist of the right racist who killed 77 people, among whom women and children.
When they call this murder, they speak of "the accident of July 22".
The Norwegians are difficult to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them could do such a barbary act.
Since the beginning of the 70s, Norway has to have its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important worldwide.
"But the oil is not the only reason that justifies our success," explains our servant, to blonde hair and in the eyes of a blue transparency, the image of northern welfare, with a rakfish plate at hand.
We are - how you say - people who are worth it.
It's the same as the most people who live here are perfect.
We're discrete, we don't like to notice.
Norway has managed its oil riches with many thoughts - all, except a low percent of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money through windows during the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway learned to keep the cordons of its well-locked bowl.
"But as long as we can shine in winter and make the randoned in the east, we are happy," he says.
"Not forget the rakfish," she says in a laughing insomniate.
I'm standing under the snow and doing the cup to buy me what to eat -- I got my cancer dose.
In the menu, a hamburger composed of elan, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the fish's hot is everywhere.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places where we use the rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most odourful of them.
There is a TV emission where the presenter carries a node-papilon, surrounded with rakfish seats.
We would believe in the Eurovision concurrence.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"It's our points, Havard."
We hear smiles and applauses.
A man falls out of his box, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult department.
While the President Enrique Pena Nieto is ready to take his functions in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, is interested in the difficulties that expect him and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Traveling to Mexico is especially bad at the present time.
In a city where the embustibles are normally, a security bargage has been placed since Monday, blocking several key route access to the capital and providing a real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from returning to their work, but to prevent demonstrants from reaching Parliament.
Next Samedi, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential shore to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complied task of the action.
Mexico's economy is good, the results to the President of Felipe Calderon, but the country is close to a war of drugs that has already costed about 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has taken the commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Pena Nieto said to the American President Barack Obama in the Ovale Bureau a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before covering the American President, Mr. Pena Nieto was Governor of Mexico State.
A very popular and temptational state that includes the capital. On its predilection land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic community of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is included in the memory of all.
Locals attribute to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the commune.
To join the city, you can take one of Mr. Pena Nieto's new autoways, an important improvement has been brought to these roads, sometimes bosseled and full of crops.
Treeboards are drawn outside a new sport complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We count on him to make sustainable changes," said his friend and political alien Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and the Party of Mr. Pena Nieto, the Price.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years of unfailing power, the Price was acquired by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The member of the Olvera Congress admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many attendants in the party on Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticisms of opposers who reject the new president to lack of charism.
He is a whole, very engaged man with a great view of the country.
He's a great State man and, above all, he can listen.
However, this is not always the image that people of their former governor have.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paveed streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the autoways, it is, in many ways, a village in Mexico.
The problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
More early in the year, military men were called to rescue to fight drug bands in the quarters, and violence to women is particularly serious.
In a linked area, the tens of women in the last two years have been found in the decharge border.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of City Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's detractors say that, in the best way, he failed to defeat the problem of perpetrated murder against women when he was in force.
In the worst way, they accuse her administration to be able to see the reality in the face.
In a beton house, typical of this delightful apartment, Irinea Buendia fights to keep her tears when she shows me photos of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version states a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived to her, he seemed to me that her body had been washed," ra.
Signs indicate that it had been used, and the body heavyness had already been burned.
While his mother reigns the story, a photo of Mariana wipes the wall, near a cross where the word is: Justice.
However, that's exactly what the family saw.
The authorities treated me as if I was an old boyfriend, a disturbance fate, a weeping.
They want us to accept what they say and let us calm.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and abuse," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his saturday exhaust, she will be able to join a serious responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico during the last six years, and the new president has made the promise that he would make his priority during his mandate.
"I hope it will be as well as the President as when he was a Governor," Olvera said in Valle del Bravo, member of the Congress.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza are most afraid.
Bradley Manning did not complain about bad treatments, saying the prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to cope with the maltraining claims that Bradley Manning would have been victim during the detention.
The sentence is on Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Defence wants to classify the case for the reason that Manning's sequestration has been done in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to show, on Friday, that Bradley Manning soldier -- accused of being from the greatest confidential escape of information in the history of the United States Army -- had missed many opportunities to complain about bad treatments he predicted during his military detention.
In an anti-introrrogatory with Manning, during a preliminary audience in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints on its treatment.
The contra-introrrogatory -- during an audience, the defense submitted a request that Manning should be classified by the reason that the sequestration was under very difficult conditions and constituted a quite severe penalty -- occurred one day after Manning proved his desire to suicide during his detention.
This military information analysis, arrested in June 2010, is accused of debugging thousands of confidential documents during its service in Iraq.
The documents were then held online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
On Friday audience, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had filled after their meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico's military prison, where he was subject to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning and replied his answers.
When Fein announced the formula on Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment that his guards reserved to him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had had in prison was globally "very professional".
The formulaes do not state any complaint for bad treatment, although the officers directly asked him about his prison treatment, Fein stated.
Maning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would be concerned about it, but they did not record the issues.
"They wrote "no problem" (after being concerned) and, however, it did not mean that I had not raised problems," said Manning.
The military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he didn't complain about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the Special Committee that was gathered to refer to the self-suicide thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months ago.
Maning replied that his intention during the meeting was to make its restrictive status indicating a "failing risk".
The soldiers said that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level under the self-suicide risk -- to protect and security of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was going well, and I wanted to get back this status... to benefit from a better quality of life from my view," said Manning.
Manning witnessed Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was arrested for nearly two months before he was transferred to the military prison from the Base of the Corps of Marines to Quantico, Virginia, July 2010.
He said he had intended to suicide himself when he was in Kuwait and had disappeared once because of heat.
He said that the fact that the fact that it had not been obtained to the corant of what he was going to happen to him or what happened in the rest of the world was very anxious.
"My world was reduced in Camp Arafjon, at this chain," said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I was going to go in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said that he had spent the most time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also said that the only objects he had was a mathematical, covering, tongs, clothes, and his lunches.
He tried to stay in move, because sleeping or staying long during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also pointed out that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, aligned outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he returned the night, they would wake him up to see his face.
The lawyer of Manning presented a formal complaint for the treatment of Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leaven, Kansas, April 2011.
Wednesday also, the judge asked Manning about a statement reported in his Thursday testimony -- that after having been forced to sleep in his cell all night in Quantico, he was forced to stay naked before the guards and other detained one morning during the call.
Manning testified that at any time, he was not allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
Pengt; the questions of the judge, Friday, Manning said that he had deceived the order of his guard that he had to leave his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but he recognized that no one had commanded him to leave it.
Manning witnessed Thursday that he had been forced to sleep no night, because he would have tried to prove to a officer that he was not a danger for himself.
Manning would have said to the officer that he could have used the elastic of his slip or his tongs to hurt himself, but he had not done it.
That night, Manning proved that his sub-made, his tongs, and his lunches were taken away from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of his experiences during his detention and reduce his judgment if he should be recognized in front of a martial court, a sentence that should be held in the beginning of the next year.
The Defence stated that Manning intended to be guilty of less serious crimes and to be committed for the abandon of other charges too extremely.
The audience should repeat this weekend, with prosecutors who should claim that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagone confirmed that Manning was imprisoned by the regulation regulating the conditions of detention of all prisoners in Quantico.
The accusations leaders against Manning include the flight of goods or public documents, the enemy's enemy's enemies, which provide illegal information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all accusations leaders are kept, it will encourage the perpetuity capture.
My mexico-American identical crisis
He says that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans have tend to blacking those who have gone; they remind mexicans of the difficult periods, he said.
Navarrette says that the Americans of Mexico are being taken between two worlds.
In a recent trip to Mexico, when I arrived to the Hall, before the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicate two ways: one for the "Mexicans" (Mexicans), another for "Extarearos" (Extrangers).
I stayed inmobile for several seconds, not knowing to which file to lead me.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called "Mexican" all my life.
It's a ethnic qualification, in the same title as the one that my friends in Boston use when they say "Ireland", or my friends in New York when they say "Italian".
Then I became "Mexico-American".
But here was Mexico.
And, on the earth that my grandfather has seen born, there is no need for special qualification or union trade.
I was just a American.
I speak Spanish, quite well to manage an entrepreneur in one or more languages.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an autochtone, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and led me to the "Ettrangers" row.
I thought at that moment of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the Black House.
Generally, when leaders of these two countries meet, their predilection is immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexico economy, which is one of the reasons for mexican people to stay in Mexico rather than to risk the United States.
He wants to go to the United States and Canada and create a trade union on the model of the European Union, but in Northern America.
And Pena Nieto commits to continue war against drug cards in Mexico, although he had no more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with amertum.
Most Americans have probably never thought that in 1848, the United States invade Mexico and forced its leaders to cross in writing half of their territory at the street.
But for Mexico, who think for centuries, and not for minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as a U.S. official puts the least critical about Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexico press, and among the Elite -- complaints on how the Americans are affected by their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for baggage.
Yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country treats with the more than 35 million Mexico-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to handle the subject of amertum?
There's a lot.
Mexico has its winners and its perfections, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer it.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican forefathers in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at a time given, in our genealogic tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a type of profile -- a low, low-instructed skin, out of a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we live now the American dream that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose our view that it is the American dream we live, not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is evident.
We agree with this in the United States.
In addition, we know that a part of Mexico elite among the leader class does not love us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defect and they throw us as if we were individuals of lower souches and not enough Mexico.
Our Spanish will never be pretty good, our connections with Mexico will never be enough strong.
For them, our existence is a failure synonym.
If our families failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have gone.
And we will not find ourselves on the right side of the barrier, living comfortable in the United States, but as losts.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who had emigrated in the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are fractions between Mexico and Mexico and Mexico, since Mexico are more closer to their identity and the Mexico-Americans are contrary.
Although she is a American citizen, she feels to be part of two countries.
Moreover, many Mexico-Americans I know have no impression of being part of one country or another.
We love mexican group music, Los Tigres del North, but also Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of the two worlds, but we are not inracinated in any of the two.
In Mexico, we are viewed as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered mexican.
And now, to complicate a little more the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and a part of the intellectuality want to draw close to Diaspora.
They want Mexican and Americans to work as a happy ambassador for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We must explain to our American partners that Mexico is a great country that is absolutely needed to visit and press political leaders to strengthen connections with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
That wouldn't be.
There's too much anxiety.
And if we consider the inequalities of salary, corruption and violence related to drugs that are all present, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to deal with yourself alone, friends.
That's normal.
If some Mexico people are still not ready to forgive the United States for the way they have treated Mexico a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexico-Americans always see them how their family members have been treated there is not so long.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "mexican" than I thought.
Love old, new Middle-East
Stop the fire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there never be a sustainable peace between the Arabs and the Middle East?
Another blood exhaust indicates that such a hope is invalid.
While the same furious arguments were persistent to know who started, tens of buildings were reduced in dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelites were killed; and for the first time, Gaza's rockets came near Tel-A, Israel's metabol, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelites and the Palestinians are locked in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full mutation.
The Arab Premium has made it to steal, and whether or not, the Palestinians and the Israelites are struck by this regional disturbance.
Perhaps their fight will be a little more intensified.
However, there are all reasons for thinking that this could help them out of this mortal impairment.
A war that doesn't make any perfection or winner
Firstly, it is difficult to demonstrate optimism.
Although the fire was granted on 21 November, the fights of this week have strengthened the force partys on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the islamist movement that leads Gaza since 2007, will be forced to force the Israelites to leave, even if Gaza has tried a race.
Having killed some of his leaders and refused the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and surpopulated corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas wins the land on the West Jordan, the other part of the Palestinian currently in their hands of Fatah, the other more moderated Palestinian factor.
Moreover, Hamas' leaders could say that time is their covenant.
The influence of the islamists in the Arab world is more strong, and Hamas became rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regional power in full essor, sometimes the nearest Muslim Alliance of Israel, took and caused Hamas; like the Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic states of Golf.
The members of Hamas jubilate and say that the crossing Islamist is running around Israel, from Lebanon, north, where the mile of Hezbollah exercises his domination, by the way of the Islamist trends can turn back to Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where the Hamas covenants threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the south floor of Israel, the mount of the Muslim Brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, that depote that ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to dedicate to Hamas.
However, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas' neighbors, and their leaders easierly move them to the opinion.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas may be a major actor who will not be able to be excluded even by Israel and America.
During this time, the partisans of the hard line of Israel will remove the inverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was transferred into box.
The Baptized Iron Dome intercept system has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its indefective support; and many European countries have reproached Hamas that they are originating in the last vague of violence.
In particular, Israel promoted, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza's rockets have killed approximately 30 Israelites since 2004, Israel has been avoided by suicide attacks, especially by the separate barry on the West, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, which protects the Jewish colonies that continue to spread up despite their illegality in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined with a even more bellyist party, the leader of Avigdor Lieberman at the next election of January 22th, has the beautiful part.
Why do you dolote these Palestinian figs by giving them a state?
If they were leading the West, would they not run rockets, as their partners did to Gaza?
It is preferred to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get out of their head.
Perhaps the partisans of the hard line will have it; but it may be that Arabic first-time changes the woman.
Although the islamists who take power in Egypt and elsely appreciate a little Israel, their priority will be to address problems in their own countries.
The budget of Israel's defence is more important than the four of its gathered Arab neighbors.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economy.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama for a fire stop which is good -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world that becomes more democratic, to avoid the Palestinians from their right to self-determination could create a powder that is dedicated to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a little like the bus that exploded in Tel-A this week.
Repression has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demography highlights this problem as Arabic population grows.
Blood missions against Gaza every two or three years to call Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be moved by those outside.
The answer remains the reasonable persons that are found on each side, and most of the outermost world and this journal: two states, with a residence of a territory by Israel in exchange of security.
A small and short-term hope is that the fire will cease him to give foreign people the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, who now has to be attempted to end arms to Gaza, in the same title as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state at the borders of 1967 with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also press Hamas and Fatah to join them.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than to the next proposal for a Pseudo state in the United Nations.
Mr Obama is also interested in what Israel accepts to negotiate.
During his first mandate, he did not present his own peace plan.
From return to the White House, he also retients to establish one.
It's a very terrified vision.
The Middle East stability is a vital injury for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarette packages have entered into force
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, whether the mark
This law entry into force is a worldwide first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark and horrible photograph of sick organs and representations of children and children whose diseases have been caused by their parents' tobacco.
Outside of various health photos and warnings, the only difference between packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the label, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the strictest system in the world in the area of tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government said that the goal was to dismiss young people to smoke by eliminating any representation of glamour.
Studies showed that if people haven't started smoking before 26 years of age, 99% of the chances they never start.
"Although they are very young, children understand the message vehicleed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said the Federal Ministry of Health, Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that, for example, reveal that children associated with a logo to a princess."
Even if Australia records the lowest rate of tobacco worldwide and these changes only have little impact on the benefits of the multinationals, other countries consider an analogue approach.
The tobacco industry pressed this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that this would restore the trade in the black market, which would easier provide access to less dear cigarettes.
"The distressing consequences will be discovered from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco.
China and Indonesia's faussers will sell much more cigarettes of contravention in Australia's streets.
Others said that this law had dynamized their activity.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the request for cigarettes, especially in silicone to hide horrible packagings, has increased strongly two months ago since British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have contested the law and lost before the high court of Australia.
She said Zico sold 6.000 to grossists and expected renewal of stocks.
For us, business is good.
The only one, the experts say, is the popularity of social media and the targeted population range.
According to a series of Australian laws that prohibit TV advertising, sport sponsoring and the obligation of refunders to dissimulate cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has prohibited publicity on the Internet by businesses and local sites, but she cannot prevent foreign sites from doing it.
"If you work in the marketing of tobacco and you have only a small vitrine to promote your products, the Internet is the incontourable place by excellence," said Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some lambda citizens in favour of the brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We should ask ourselves whether this is a simple citizen who loves the cigarettes Marlboro and who has been deceived to make a video, or is it a marketing campaign orchest by an agency?
British American Tobacco appealed that the industry is on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new justice decisions - these countries told the WHO that trade is unfairly disappeared, although no of these countries had a significant trade trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the 2013 course.
Plibersek stated that the Government had discussed with other countries on similar package laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos on packing in 2001.
These warnings are now presented in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Severe laws are currently in the study in Letter, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers remain insensitive to these photos.
Photos don't hurt me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and break the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package on which there is a photo of your mouth tutor.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna stop is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the center of Sydney, said that the pack unformity was difficult to arrange packages on the station.
"Before, I needed a hour to download a colis, now I need four hours," said Yu.
"The government had only to prohibit them a good time for everyone and we would have said OK, it's good, it's okay, it's stopped and put the key under the door," he drew up, lifting his arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to divorce.
I spent five hours in a airport during the period of Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to think about the theme of the wedding.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Passing a half day in a airport to wait for a flight is quite anxious, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones for you (not forgotten duty-free boots).
In addition, some universities and experts specialised in the development of the child make anxiety.
It's perfectly normal for us - and our children - to enjoy time in time, they say.
This forces the brain to empowere interesting paths, or even to feed creativeness.
And as we are, most of us, constantly before several types of ransoms, we don't know the benefits of the anxiety anymore.
So, should we accept an open arm's charge?
Yeah.
And not.
But I'll be back there.
Above all, as many people, I thought the annuity was a very recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, Greek History Professor at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale_Press, 2011).
"It's very far," he said.
On the walls of Pompei, there are Latin graphfites that call the annuis, they ascend to the first century.
Then there's the definition we give to the neighbor.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, aggregated psychology teacher in York in Ontario, Canada.
After parking many publications and submitting the idea to a group of approximately 100 persons, Professor Eastwood and his teachers defined the announcement as an experience that consists of "will want to do something but not to be able to start in a satisfactory activity".
What differs from the appetite, he says, is that the person is not taking a job that she would like.
With the aptitude, he says, there's no desire to do something.
What is in the heart of the anxiety, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a mad humor and the feeling that the time is slow."
Anxiety can make a depression strongly.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both of them can be connected, people who are noted are tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes, we think we are hurt when it is a problem of concentration.
In the framework of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was held in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his ́egues made evidence of an ancient experience in which the participants listened on the cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the nearby room, the too high sound of a TV emission that had no report, others just heard the TV emission, and the third group did not hear the sound band.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said that they were more worried than the other two groups -- they had a problem to face themselves, but they didn't know why, and they assigned this problem of concentration to the nutrition.
When you're trying to face a difficult or interesting task, an interruption of attention can lead to annuity, said Mark J. Fenske, an aggregated neuroscience teacher to the face of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
Yet, when you do a worrying task, "as looking at objects on a mounting chain, music can help you not hurt you."
In fact, he says, at present, we know that when we torture or grip, these gestes, often considered as signs of anxiety, are actually a good way to remain more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are authorised to get gigoter learn more and receive more information than those who are forced to stay without moving," said Professor Fenske.
We're all weird once or once -- the delay of my flight, a speaker with a single-corded voice, a particularly anxious movie.
But some people are more likely to be disappointed than others.
In order to measure this, researchers developed a "pre-disposition scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as: "For the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so much interest centers that I don't have time to do everything."
By using such a scale, researchers discovered that boys had the trend to get more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology teacher at the West Florida, and in particular needed many and different stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blamed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a individual and Community development teacher at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience during which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a beeper.
He highlighted that 32 percent of the teenagers claimed to renew themselves to the oil and during their duties at the house, while 23 percent declared to be disappointed when they were not at the oil.
On the contrary, 3 percent of parents said that they were disappointed.
Professor Larson said that he didn't know whether the percentage of today's inquiry, or 21 years later, would be higher or later.
But he said that he knew that "adolescence is a period when anxiety reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control on what they want to do.
If I ask my question, is it good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd risks, to compare or to abuse certain substances to pass time, as studies show it.
However, many philosophers and writers have called a link between annuity and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for over two decades.
"The ennui is the way the brain found to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology teacher at N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you are worried and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
But if you look at the TV, it will make you happy to short-term, but not long-term.
So if your child is worried and you give him a iPad, he will no longer hurt, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or to do it, says Professor Fenske.
"This automatically passes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child is not only learning to enter entertainment, but also getting more control from himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the anxiety.
Just as I don't think we should criticize it.
It feels outside the constant boiling that generates activities and it is the goal to which we should draw up.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to weep more often, but anxiety wakes an agu and frenética desire to be connected to something that has a meaning," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate the stop time.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he said, "there is difficult to find ways to start in something when the voice stops."
In Colorado, no directive on the new Marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, student at a university and foot player in Colorado, is invoked for something that will soon become in his state: the possession of marijuana bullets and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were at a car border in Lamar, in the middle of the fields near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quotation to compare for drugs and material possessions that could serve to its consumption - small crimes, each accompanied by an amend of $100 - and a comparative date.
"We're treated as elsewhere," said Mr. Orozco.
But is that one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to enhance the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for its personal use, the response offered to hundreds of business that include low use of drugs depends more than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, who adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involved the use of marijuana have been classified immediately.
Police services stopped accusing adults of 21 years and more for minor marijuana ownership because the law will enter into force in the next weeks.
But the prosecutors in Colorado's most conservative circles have called to accelerate existing marijuana businesses and continue to accuse the people who possess it.
Parallelly, several cities of Denver to the west mountains vote to prevent the opening of marijuana sales markets approved by the State in their quarters.
"The things evolute so quickly that I don't know what the future is for us," said Daniel J. Oates, head of the police of Aurora, east of Denver.
The regulatory agencies of the State of Washington also have no wrong to ask questions.
They are searching for directives on how to install a licence system, which allows production, manufacture, distribution and sale - before the date of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether or not, is in advance on the majority of marijuana regulatory states, along with the use for therapeutic purposes and now on personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E.
But no place or system, recognizing Mr. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"There is no reality on which we could be based," he said.
The Law of Washington, which is I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which leaves an empty legal year, during which the license system will not exist, while the ownership of marijuana will still exist.
In this time, practical issues remain in suspension: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees adequate access to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales in a 30-km range around a school, a park, a game area or a crochet.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas for an approved sale of cannabis, especially in the Metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a password of the Cannabis Alliation Centre, a recently-formed research group.
On 21 November, the police leader, Oates, to Aurora, sent a mail to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (representative of the Public Ministry) would no longer pursue the 21-year-old persons with small quantities of marijuana, and that the police had to stop accusing people for this type of crime.
Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new justice decisions that regulate the activities of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to continue with drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, north of Colorado, the "Attorney District" (Republical Prosecutor), Ken Buck has a closer view.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to take care of marijuana property cases, mainly in order to press users in order to dissintoxic.
Currently, 119 people are guilty of possession of 56 grams or less marijuana, but many of them are subject to other accusations.
"Our office has the obligation to commit persecution against those who have committed a crime that was a recognised crime at the time of facts," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were even complicated in rural places such as Mesa County, where the voters rejected the initiative for restricted marijuana consumption.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the county, does no longer compare adults to the possession of restricted quantities.
The representative of the Public Ministry of the Court, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all cases of marijuana.
"I don't have the impression of losing my time to continue applying the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of Colorado voters have supported the measure, a legal and government framework for marijuana personal consumption is not easy.
And the contradicting reactions observed in various American cities show the deep ambivalence among local officials in relation to marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the Public Ministry, Sean McAllister, a lawyer of Denver, representing the people accused of marijuana and expressing it as a local portfolio of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws).
"They have passed a lot of their lives to continue in justice for people who were consuming marijuana, too, have difficulty accepting that it is possible," he said.
As the first states to treat the restricted marijuana consumption at the same level as the alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are going to become a case of legalism for drugalisation.
While defenses and representatives of the State provide a new border of ventures, they are concerned about the directives of the Federal Government, which always include the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defensors of Marijuana's Marijuana's relief hope that the Ministry of Justice will cede.
Despite some mediated arrestations of patients under therapy and sellers, the Federal Government has especially allowed marijuana sales to be exercised in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other states.
If it is true that the police is probably not going to push the doors to catch small drug sackets, it is strong to consider that it is opposed to marijuana's customers to personal use authorised by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, an ancient political adviser of Obama.
Many towns of Colorado have not expected the federal authorities to act.
Before the votes, some local administrations have approved moratorys on the creation of new marijuana sales markets, even if it is only a year's report.
Last week, the city of Montrose has received a 6-month moratory, and it should impose this prohibition on the next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where a license is granted to someone and then find us confronted with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal Council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than in the state's vote.
Many questions are asked.
Petronella Wyatt: I was deceived and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
These are not only today's students who are attacked for their opinions.
So far as I remember, I always dreamed to enter Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied what was a wonderful place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphithatheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed at Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to study the story, I decided to make my values, providing the first scandale of my life.
My father flew and began to weep.
My friends were discovered.
The journal of Evening Standard claimed that I had left this university because I had objected the fact that students in the first cycle had sexual relations in the room near my room.
The author A. N. Wilson said fakely that I was gone after being forced to drink in brake bags.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yes, I'm running, because I was victim of intimidations and made the object of constant brimadas.
Not because of my name is very disappointed, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persuaded for one and only reason, and in this beach of self-declaring, I was victim of a racist and barbarian behavior: my lamentable father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influent adviser of Margaret Thatcher and I was part of the Conservator Party.
Why do you call this today, tell me.
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of right-right students is the same type of perseverance.
The growing and institutional hatred of Tory students in Oxford is like last week, some of them have required protection of their rights, as well as the gays, handicaped people and ethnic minorities.
Conserving members of the Student Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College stated that they were "isolated, personally attacked and felt unnecessary" due to their political opinions.
They want a representative in the University Committee for Equality of Chancencies so that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Country of Marvels: Young, Intelligents and Droite"), dedicated to the policy among students, and depending the "Tories" as excentric and neonacists.
In particular, student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford · Conservative Propertyation (OUCA)", who moves to Rolls-Royce, trees a completely silvered and moves with a cross-headed candle.
In other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as issuers of the establishment of school costs."
Luke Black, 20 years old, president of the "Nottingham" Conservative, said to a journal on Sunday "that there is a cross-growing party at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even met us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, studying in history in the Corpus Christi, who proposed a movement for more protection, said that such a climate is "inconfortable" and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, president of the OUCA, said that there was a detail of the attitude of the JCR members in relation to people who are from the right.
"This is a barrier to the freedom of intellectual debates and to the welfare of members," she said.
I was the only one to think about this in my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, then I was 18 years old and a paralyzing timidity.
The hatred of the conservator party was very virulent.
In the year, the university voted to grant Margaret Thatcher - an ancient student - a honorable title, due to the reduction of the financing of higher studies.
The atmosphere was loaded by stalinal vibrations.
Since the first days of the week of receipt, when the new students met others and teachers, I had an advance of what was going to happen afterward.
I discovered that the teachers were not only participating in sarcasms to Tory students, but also enjoying it.
It was as if the political policy on miners, privatization and opposition of the Government to sanctions against the apartment in South Africa was recorded in the woods of the class rooms.
The first sarcasm I was victim was a translation to the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared there.
"Ms. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (continuing deadly), "and you're translating the first paragraph"
I lost my feet.
Pitt, a little guy in the puzzle face, was easily getting away.
"Is that the Thatcherists are learning French or are they just stupid?" asked he.
Other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you to take French courses during your free time - finally, if you are not too busy to make your friends," he started with a tone.
I'm back to my room, unconscious.
At dinner tonight, I sat alone, and I felt a tape on my neck.
He was a student in second year of studies, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OCA.
"I know who you are," he said, dearly.
I'm so afraid he's like that.
Any person suspicious of being a Tory (conservator) is taken for purpose.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know that your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even more difficult for you.
Most of the young Tory claims to be Labors (worklists).
Later, at the local pub, I was quite trying to hide myself.
I insisted on the fact that I did not agree with all that Mrs Thatcher said.
This strategy failed.
A student in the first year of philosophy, political and economic science who, ironicly, had studied in Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist porc."
You're contaminated.
Other students have recovered the refrain.
I've been perverted, sweetheart.
"How do the Tories love?" asked one of them.
They strike each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexual before the liberal legislation of the sixty years.
Would I just have been able to lead a normal life to Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after the night's fall?
Should I be Labour and refuse my opinions?
In the next three years, there was nothing to happen to a cleaning of isolicism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, modern history teacher, who teached at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservator, but also because he was adviser in the outer policy of Thatcher and one of the authors of his speech.
He wasn't almost there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his accession to the marxist-determinist view of the history.
In 1997, he accepted a teacher post at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started to make the ship between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and my friends in the most open mind.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was unbelievable.
Pengt; its studies in Oxford, in the 40s, were accepted all political points.
"But this is the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the town with dreams.
Even my friends had inappropriate ways.
He had the tears in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tackle you.
That would break my heart if you left Oxford.
My often traveled to London, my emotional resistance gradually deceived.
A friend, too, Tory, came to pressure and rejected his convictions.
At a working meeting next week, when another historian teacher suggested the most seriously in the world, which I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
Innerly shameful, I admitted to be victim of my parents' brain washing and the treating of "old fools".
The repeat was short-term.
It's my father who's thrown the last cloud of my oxfordian circle.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the press of Murdoch every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my followers left.
When they left, I made my wallet, and I took the first train for London.
I never came back there.
You can treat me with a weedful powder.
But no 18-year-old child should be victim of such intimidation in a school institution.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, who produced not only 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also benefits from an unusual reputation of equality and freedom of thinking.
"Valentino prefers the delegation of notority "
In the context of the "Valentino: Master of la Couture" exposed in London this week, ABC asked Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian couturier customers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place of the British capital worthy of receiving an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master de la Couture", a prestigious retrospective that gathers more than 130 high-cotting models for his home in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his enemy Italian accent.
This exhibition is the horror point of a story whose only protagonist is "the lady" Garavani, but who could not have been written without his customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and other than the nobleness.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, there is a impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the creme of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, by the princess Marie-Chantal de Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino expresses his personal memories as the trophes of his social ascension: the modesty couturier of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, at the idol of the international jet-seven.
There's nothing wrong to love the kingdom.
"They don't breathe their cigarettes on your beautiful butterfly like some stars of pop music," says the barone Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alpes and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives generosity and legacy.
"We all love to be invited in Gstaad's chat," explains the former woman of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of beauty of the past time like Marella Ag日i or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the delegation of notority.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, with a Valentino model
The argentin mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has not yet forgotten the couturist charism.
A few years ago, after a shot on the Spain Place, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were a twenty-five people, among whom Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
His mind was seen and felt in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"with him, each guest felt important and appreciated," reminds the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the High Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never pass by mode, because his creatures are art works," she concludes.
Nobless line scrolled
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves people very high and with the biggest titles and they also love it.
One of the gallerys of Somerset House has been transformed into a podium of sixty-six meters width that proposes to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of mannequins and has to roll on the podium to add a "public " dream with Valentino's main creatures, such as the size Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristote Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti had brought in "La Night", or a lanched and furniture mantle belonging to the Emperor Farah Diba.
Among this public of mannequins, names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn and Taxi, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or So日 de Habsbourg are found.
Naty Abascal and the concubine in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first garments of Valentino are like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a button, a chemistry, a gilet "gillette" and a clothing of the winter collection 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he had done to me," said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier museums.
"I prefer it to all others for his feminity, his great love for women, and because he highlights our beauty," says the former Duke of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they are ≥ and light the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and modesty Patricia della Giovapaola d'Arenberg can also forget the first time she brought a Valentino model.
When she was teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed that she had the age and the opportunity to take one of her dress of evening...
Finally, this was possible at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first model Valentino for a festival in my cousin's chat, Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a red night dress, with a fucking jupe, a shooted cup and a cup to fall.
"It was a dream of reality," said the widow of Arenberg's Rodrigue.
"Valentino is indiferent to the mode, obsessed by the intellectual," explains the Italian aristocratic who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the night clothes of the couchure with "the biggest care, because a clothes of the evening is not only a clothes, but also the memories of her vehicle".
The "Ry" of the mode
The great end of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding robe of Marie-Chantal Miller during his marriage with Paul de Greece in 1995.
It was needed four months of work and 25 "raga" (the couturier calls his coutures) to perform this ivoire robe with perles incrossings, twelve different teeth types and a train of four and a half meters.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the Supreme Authority of the Specialized Press, this robe represents a historical fact of the height of the end of the 20th century, "the return of high society customers".
For years the "knowing" of the nobless is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, covered by the Legion d'Honneur, Garavani collects so much honor as any of its customers.
"It's raffination, his calm, his healthy and perfect aspects have always sprung me in the eyes," Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw it, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my big friends.
"It was inevitable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The most hard work in the world: the mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcan porters risk their lives and their health through 70 kg of suffrage through the roads of scattered stones.
There are people whose work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who win their lives by suffering from the Kawah Ijen Vulcan in the East of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas that takes the earth's entrances is solid to air contact.
After collecting big sopher rocks, which have a total of approximately 70 kg, he installs them in two bamboo tanks that he carries on his legs through the scarpet roads.
There are only 250 meters up to the wing of the volcan that covers 2,386 meters height, but the epuised porters put more than 40 minutes to burn this distance, at a time of torture, keeping the balance and measureing their steps to not tremble and fall in the precipice.
They know that a fake step could cost them life, as it happened to a French tourist who caused a mortal fall in the Kawah Ijen Vulcan a few years ago.
Kawah Ijen's minors win 5 cents of euros for each kilogram of extrated sopher.
Once on the top, there is a road between the tourists who photographed them as if they were circle beasts, and with painful burdens, they walk at 3 kilometers to the balance that a miner company has installed a little contrabs at 1.850 meters height.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbia, a company who operates the volcan since 1960, and it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupes (5 cents of euro) per kilogram of suffrage.
It then sells it to 10,000 ropes (83 cents of euros) to the petrochemical industry because this minerai is very present in the daily life and is used to manufacture bugs, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamics and even uses to white the sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kg, we win about 46,000 ropes (3,8 euros) at each travel," explains Anto, which generally performs three journeys daily.
Each takes 3 hours and it ends exhausted, but it allows him to win 138.000 rupes (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a mistake for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would win in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid 15,000 ropes per day and where the monthly average salary is of two million ropes (167 euros)," says the portfolio who worked before as a mace on the Bali tourist island.
There, her salary was 75,000 rupies (6,20 euros) per day, and the job was not so difficult, but Anto returned close to his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village of the volcan, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is also indiscutable as the suspect: "I married a young girl of Bali, where they were Hinduists, and I brought her back to Java to make her become the Islam."
Anto suffering of astm, breathing with difficulty, all constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27 years, he spent three of his life to defeat the danger of the Kawah ljen, but the suffering has already started to pay for her the facture well that he covers his face with a mask and brings special balls.
Anto suffering of astm, breathing with difficulty, all constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases rejected by the volcan.
It's the price he has to pay to continue his dream.
"I'll work for two years, because I want to open a boot or study the Spanish or French," he promises in a more acceptable dictionary than acceptable.
Insulted by life, this young and smart young man could be tourist, server or receiptist in a hotel, but instead, he is doing the work of a mule.
It shares a mass of unsaluble wood with other porters, rises every day at two hours of the morning because the supper doesn't stop joking the night, when its yellow color becomes blue and is in the middle of the darkness.
Defiant to the darkness, Anto descends into the cratery with a small lamp fixed at his cake, which he himself bought with his own money.
Approximately 400 porters carry suffrage paners on their shoes from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the miner company has not mechanized the extraction of the suffrage to economy costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work at their account and are paid to weight.
Furthermore, they do not touch one under the 30,000 ropes (2.50 euros) of photo mass by camera, in addition to the input of 15.000 ropes (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park make to the tourists coming to photograph the volcan and its humid mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protests Madrisin, a 42-year-old carrier who works in Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he has left the garden.
He is able to carry up up to 110 kg, he will not stop working "when he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, between 10 and 18 years.
I'm not going to take my trailer, I'll die here because the volcan is my whole life.
Although the suffering damages the grass and hurts the eyes when the wind turns and puts the small ones in the woods of smoke columns out of the volcan, they are so enduring that no one claims to suffer serious diseases... which obviously have their habitual breathing problems, arthroses, pains in the knees and wheels, deformed by the weight of the payers.
By equilibring the bathroom on his back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only charge 50 kg.
Each day, his companions and his companions extracted 15 tonnes of volcan suffrage, which three trucks transport to Tamansari's store, at 18 km from there by a road of kidneys invaded by the bad herbs.
"I will not take my trailer, I will die here because the volcan is my whole life," said Uninik, opening the mouth well, devoting several missing teeth.
The age of its five children, age of 30, also works as a suffrage portor.
The time passes, but the perpetuate mistake of generation in generation one of the most difficult workers in the world: who makes the hum mules of the vulcan Kawah len.
Singapore search for children to save economy
The Singapore is responsibility for this absence of children on career, stress and the cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must develop."
I'm a husband and a patriote, you're my wife and a patriote, let's fill our civil duty and give life!
It may seem incredible that these words come from a publicity for menthe pastels, but despite that, or maybe by this, the video was spread as a powder train on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a polykine in the tower" to moving from Singapore's birthday rate.
BBH, the publicity agency originating in the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a funny way through this publicity.
His Creative Director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to fill people with "their national duty".
It is intended only for the Internet, so we could make it fun and fun.
This is the main issue in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a theme that we had to handle.
We knew that the Government had tried several things such as launching parfs to the pheromons or organizing speed-dating nights.
Many of these ideas were creative but they did not necessarily work.
So we have said the following thing: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 Children
The Government of Singapore does not take so much of it.
It costs $1,300 per year in policy to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of the Government for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends parental congestion and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effects.
Singapore is a rich and high city of Southeast Asia, also known for the conservation of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, at its national distribution of population, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, it was considered as the renewal rate in 1976.
So why don't the Singapore have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, a guide for marriage policies and the family of the National Division of Population, states that it is due to a "better education" and "a greater choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a larger range of options in terms of life and priorities, beyond marriage and family constitution," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the deterioration of the number of singles and to delay marriage and birth, which resulted in a decreasing rate of birth in Singapore.
Meanwhile, a immigration policy aimed at radically increased immigration to contrary the decrease of the population created a feeling within the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites that excite a nearly disgusting xenophobia against new immigrants, especially for Chinese who are accused to take the salaries down and not to integrate.
The immigration is also considered as one of the reasons for which the party in Singapore has known its worst electoral results since independence last year.
Since elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the establishment of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall of birth rates has effect on the economic growth of a country, tax income, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unexpected consequences.
The Government tries to avoid building many small houses.
For example, this began to touch the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities began to control the number of small apartments, with the name of the "cause box", which could be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned about the fact that they can promote a single life and disturb the promotors who want to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Immobiliary Society EL, states that his "causs-boats" are selling much faster than bigger apartments.
They are more popular, in the meaning that these apartments are building much faster than the bigger size.
For this reason, it's much more profitable for our treasures.
However, he admits that the new standards provide more guidelines to promotors, which were previously placed in the wheels if they wanted to offer too small apartments in a project.
Too Stress
Singapore is a city of State.
If these new regulations may be a step towards national birth rates, talking with the Singapore who work in the financial quarter of the centre, it would be that they would not have much effects.
"The people are very stressed, the houses are dear, just as education, that is why people send it to later," says a young framework.
Others may have children.
"But for me, it is important to be able to have my money and my time," says another youth of a twenty-year-old.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of access to property and education as the reasons for preventing children.
Thus, although the Government is trying to convince his citizens to have children, when it is to make children, it is the Singapore themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
In accordance with the Dictionary of the Royale Spanish Academy, this is the quality of the privacy or "the area of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What does it refer to the private area for less than 16 years?
How to apply this definition in daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he exposes to by spreading on the Internet events that he would certainly not share offline?
The journal El Periodico asked five young boys, between 10 and 15 years old, often users of the toilet.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "all of very personal" on personal level and "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not devote my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, 10 years, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has a account for two years.
"There are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On the FB, I'm putting fine images or games.
I'm talking to my friends too.
"I'm not going to share one of my photos or someone who would make the idiot," he said.
The young boy recognized that it is bad to make obscene photos, denounced persons, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on the FB and his nine subscribed to Twitter.
Most are family.
It's part of her mother, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting Twitters.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just put them," he said.
"Social networks are funny, I can talk to remote parents or my friends quickly," he said.
He states that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He won't trust someone who would recommend a foreigner.
Joseph's case, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on this last, admits that he does not know 20 of the people in the list of friends.
"This doesn't worry about me because we have something common, for example music," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made her progress or asked her address or phone number.
"If they put the pressure on me or require it, I would just remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name of cyberharchlement are not strangers to the young boy.
A close to one of my friends has been racketed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assured.
The victim, José, didn't close his account.
"It was just a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulation to configure his account safely.
At the difference of Jorge, this young man would put photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I was angry or angry.
"Although I know that it's cyber-harmonic," he says.
Keys
Marielos Porras, teacher and licensed in Education and Learning, considers that in order to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the goal of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has occurred as a way to search for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the game rule has changed," she recalls.
Porras reports that the Academic Mark Prensky, who has a pedagogic master at Yale University and author of the book "Natifs and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomena.
Digital natives, these are they, children and young people who are born with it.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she said.
It reveals that the theme is complex, "for we ask them to have a criteria defined on what it is appropriate or not to spread, split or say to an age where they do not have the needed maturity to do it."
"We also ask them to be selective, while what is most important for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," she says.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
"They say not to do it serves nothing," she says.
Then, Porras recalls some examples: There are things you wouldn't do to a foreigner, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to make a photo of you like the friend you've made?
Do you know what the others do about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask others for permission to identify them?
And, too, everyone needs to know what you're doing at every instinct?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do it offline.
These are the same rules.
"When the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Stuardo Guardia, University Professor, Primary Institute and Education Advisor, says that it is essential that parents read consciously the conditions for the use of social networks.
In understanding each of the terms, they will have solid bases to discuss with their children about the implications of the opening of an account on the Internet.
"For example, the age and what is allowed to share or guard," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that it is not necessary to talk to foreigners.
The summary of the Unasur ended without making the Lima Declaration
The VIe Presidency of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) has been completed today in Peru without the fact that the Lima Declaration has been made fair, although it has been announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 present mandaters.
Efe tried to accept the document signed at the VIe Orderary Meeting of the Government of the States and the Government of the Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency reported that it would be disclosed after the end of the summit, and then claimed that it would be held at a time on the Peru Government's website.
When they were asked about the text, they reported that its content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, during short press statements.
The access of journalists to the summit information was continually limited.
Today, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private, restricted audio" was spread in the press room.
The few information between journalists was given by the press attachments of some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, except the Peruian portfolio.
The only document published on the day was the list of present presidents, which caused a certain disease in the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media that claimed more important information.
Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an electronic court to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the talk of President Humala and not of the official document that concluded the summit.
In October last, Peru was the guest of the third top of South America (ASPA) and, in this occasion, although this was requested by the press, he did not also spread the statement also called Lima Declaration, as it had been announced.
On the official site of the ASPA, the document could be checked on the last March.
In both international meetings, the Peru authorities tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited at least information.
The summit also concluded with the Joint Chile and Peru Agreement to accept a Court of Justice of Haye, which extends a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala and Chili, Sebastián Piñera, meeting at the regional meeting and said that they would respect the decision of the CIJ to hear the complaints of both parties in the trial that Lima intended against Santiago and which began on Monday in La Haye.
"We will respect and exhibit the sentence that will resolve the differences we have today before this international court," said President Humala, on the side of its Chilean approved.
"Chili has always been, and will continue to be a respectful country of international law, peaceful resolution of conflicts, treaties and international courts," President Pinnera said by giving the President Humala a handful to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the CIA has occurred after that week Colombia has declared that Bogota's halt by which she had agreed to submit to the decisions of the International Court, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua, which she considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of Brazil's presidents, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
The Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the destitution of his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged to open the debates on the morning and closing the top shortly after midnight in Lima.
The mandatary read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 project action lines had been established between South America countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the adopted agreements, he mentioned that the countries of the Unasur would set " important steps to achieve the purpose of South America's citizenship by developing agreements on residence licences".
He informed that action would be made to improve the "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and internationally organized crime, action for better access to medicines, low-price access to the Internet throughout South America, and to evaluate the risks of natural disasters together and effectively".
With a crisis Europe, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) should not have a triomphalist matrix but need to help increase our production matrix and enter a better future for our populations," concluded President Humala.
"We decided to privilege a group of 31 embryo projects that improve the connection of South America spaces, particularly in rural and border areas... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the President Peruviene during a talk.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were involved in Peru and was on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two had a more important connection with the Equator, although he had not given more details.
The final document also refers to Paraguay's political situation.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration within the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having a good relationship with its neighbors, is another subject at the top.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he would hope to meet his approved from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on the next Sunday in Mexico to discuss the maritime difference in a judgment of the CIA requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with the Nicaragua who will ask for a discussion with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilised and respectful way," President Santos said.
The presidents of Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they planned to assist the power of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the context of the summary, the Defence Ministers will meet before-timely to approve the Action Plan of 2013, which is trying to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in the region in defence.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Equator, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the last country is suspended.
The Peru shall provide the chairmanship per time of the regional block.
"South America must have Europe's way to integrate a citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Equator, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, had to take examples on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the VIe top of the South American Nations Union (Unasur) in Lima, stated to the State TV, Peru TV, that the Europeans were "interviewed in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but they were now almost a country".
In this regard, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the Member States of Unasur.
"The freedom of citizens and workers in any country of South America must be achieved, as it is already the case for the members of the Indian Community, but there are still reactionary areas we want to take part in the past."
Furthermore, the Equatorian Chairman has demonstrated the reconstitution of the United States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatures of the Pacific of San José on Human Rights.
Those who fight our ears never compromise anything, in turn, we, the South Americans, signed it all.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," he stated, making an allocation to the political asylum granted by the Equator to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision because he himself has not delivered his principles, but he has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "There were founded suspicions which Assange would be extracted to a third country and that its judgment would not be respected."
Moreover, it criticizes the Swedish justice that requested to submit on its territory a questionary about a sustained sexual crime while "the Swedish own legislation allows it to be done by video conference, which could be done since the Equator's ambassade in London."
Correa claimed that there was a risk that the mental and mental health of Assange delayed.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our ambassador, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said Equatorian President.
It is possible that its health and mental delays by being spent in a small space without being able to exercise free air.
"This acts on the health of anybody," he concludes.
Correa reports that the solution of asylum granted to Assange since June in the Equatorial Ambassador of London, which would be the assignment of a non-conduct that would allow him to become Equator, is located in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European Judges authorities and stresses that he had discussed in London to find a solution to the closed WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is found in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European Judges authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures at various European institutions," he mentioned.
And he thinks, "If Great Britain had granted the non-conduct tomorrow, it would be done."
And if Sweden, as it actually allows its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange in the Ecuador ambassador in London, or asked it by Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be resolved.
Correa benefited from reaffirming himself as a defensor of the freedom of press, and he indicated that what he would not tolerate was "the mediacrit, the bad faith and the lies that hurt the freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the wicked or wicked politicians, but the bad journalists on the soldier of affection, singing and extortion," he said.
Under this angle, he welcomed that this is not the type of journalists "not the bans or the Hegemonic and Bourgeo countries dominant in Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his election, "the revolution would be increasing to follow the road and track the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the Veto on Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that "the opportunity and the temptation of degused state failing should be closed and not tolerated" because "they would actually destroy the employment of Paraguay Democracy".
Moreover, the Equatorian President considers the "perfectly relevant" desire of its Colombian approved, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate the maritime limits between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of Hague, which will strengthen the sovereignty of Nicaragua.
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be exceeded by the will of progress.
We need to solve them in their ink to over and go from before.
At the same time, he trusted in the right resolution of the dispute on the maritime borders that oppose Peru and Chile within the same court and said that it is "build that Latin America is to introduce international institutions if both countries agree to accept a so closed judgment."
With regard to the possibility of its presentation as candidate to the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to enforce a third consular mandate, he noted that he saw this option "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the primaries of February 2013, he would leave from life.
At personal level, I have never been interested in the power, but in situations like Ecuador's, this social and economic poverty can only be resolved by the political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential mandate, and then I will get out of the political life.
If we never forgive us, I'll do it too.
"This is my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just discussed with the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a refusal from the health status of President Chavez," he commented.
The Equatorian Head of State has now participated in Lima in the VIth top of the Government leaders of the United States of South America (Unasur) who had completed a call for a better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
The deaths related to AIDS today are caused to a late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when it was confirmed the result of the test: sero.
"It's like the sky fell on my head," he said referring to it at the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "mince painful" in vain.
The young man hid him to his family.
He decided to carry himself alone of his illness and began to inform himself about it and his appreciation was as he just celebrated his 43th anniversary.
There is no doubt one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Guadalajara civil hospital (HCG), in which he was found in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio lives with the immunodeficiency virus hum· (VIH) since 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there were many doubts, little choices of treatment and more stigmates.
So even the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided to say to him "for he was without voice."
At that time, the SIDA was a synonym of death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, "epulsed" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after AIDS appeared in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the appropriate time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," stated Jaime Andrade Villanueva's head of the HCG VIH unit, and he refers to that information was validated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS infections and experts, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no more a mortal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of immune system affectation that patients had at the time of the Property, with better perspectives for those who do not consume drugs: up to 30 years for a rate of CD4 of 200 and up to 50 years for those with a rate of 500 CD4.
To simply speak, this means that for someone who receives a HIV positive at 25 years, "when he remains under control, he can live without problems up to 75 years," explained the scientist.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the Mexican hope of life is now of 76 years in the average.
If it is true that death has been significantly decreased in recent years, in Mexico, the number of individuals died from AIDS sequences has passed from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (only UNUSIDA’s annual report), but it is also true that, since AIDS appears, 60% of the patients listed on the national database were killed.
Not only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May this year; however, access to antiretroviral medicines has been universal since 2005.
So why are there more deaths?
I think the problem is not from access to treatment.
That's what I see, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years, we have never missed medicines, the problem is that patients arrive to very advanced stages because they don't know that they are infected, or then they learn it at progressive stages of disease.
It gives us an indiscusable fact "new of ten patients comes when they already have an opportunistic infection, which is needed to have greater impact on the global mortality, is to perform more recently and, therefore, it is necessary to offer massive depisting tests to all people who ask it."
The specialists and members of the AIDS State Council of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who have made his depisting test in a private laboratory, just because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a portor of AIDS and suffered from Caposi’s sarcom, a cancerous tumor that is one of the coherent complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to do it, it's better than I'm stuck three times a week," they say, "it's not my case.
The change was beneficial, I'm eating well, I'm exercising, I'm taking my medicines.
Today, his parents only know that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anybody else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have a active sexual life, but co-responsible, I take attention to me and to the other person," Ra_ Fabrizio, who accepted to share his integrity with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his witness, those who are afraid today, during the walk of the World Day against AIDS.
If they do the test, if they have taken risks, they will soon know if they are serious and better, and if they already have the test, they need to know that we can live as everyone, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the fight against AIDS in this year 2012.
Reserves on account
There are many footnotes between the health programmes and the citizen, supporting Ricardo Salazar, a journalist of Guadalajara, who took the cause of HIV.
And the biggest resides in prevention.
In all the places assigned to this, "We have actually increased the distribution of preservatives, before we were given one or two, now we are given hundred packages, it is very good, but it is the result, that some today have no access to preservatives," he says.
Of the most vulnerable in the new infections, adolescents are found.
The question, "What are you going to do?", which was put with sarcasm and valuable judgments by social workers, orientation advisers, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, assure the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; that preservatives not only be sold to accounts, but that they be found in the toilet distributors and in the places that youths are frequently.
It is not to encourage the promiscuity.
It is also not to pay them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had answered when asked if there was a distribution of preservatives within his administration.
"This is not the way sexuality works, but the best is to provide preservatives to people already active in sex," he stressed.
Numbers in Jalisco
13.435 cases are reviewed (12.158 of AIDS and 1.317 of HIV).
The State is the fourth State of the country in the number of new cases and cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV diseases.
92% of the pollution are sexually, 6% by blood and 2% perinately.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each case, four or 5 people do not know it.
A sentence invoked by a court of the United States ignores the repealing of the debt of the Vitro Group through a commercial failure in Mexico. The scenario causes a disadvantage for all the national companies in the neighborhood and with solvency problems.
The procedures for survival of companies authorised by the Mexican laws are therefore not valid in the country of starband, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the court sent by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Affairs for the North Texas on 15 June leaves Mexican companies without defense against the possibility of embarcation of their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main glass manufacturer of Mexico to introduce the Supreme Court of the United States based on three incoherences.
On the other hand, while the Court of Justice notes that the creditors must register the United States Law on the failures, the Fifth Call Court, sitting at New Orleans, claims that the main procedure is the formalised trade failure in Mexico.
The first point would be to deny international procedure cooperation in cases of insolvency of undertakings with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the International Commercial Drot International Uniformation was created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrary.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the interoperated vote, recognised in the critical mass of trade failure, the debts contracted by Vitro's branches against the mother society, the majority required for the approval of the revolution could not have been obtained.
However, Mexico laws have this opportunity.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are a half-dozen examples, among whom Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whose Federal Institute of False Commercials had guaranteed debts.
Moreover, it is certain that, since he remained the votes of the branches, Vitro's creditors who were against it in the courts of the United States, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, they would have not received the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes against 37.
A data forbidden by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation that he had faced since 2008 without stoping the serious economic crisis against the United States, which reacted to the costs of the country.
Instead, the family company of González Sada will intercede before the same appeal court that the vote would take place in its entirety, namely with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The insurance demands non-profession and requires the revision of the proceedings by a higher instance, in that case, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the "amicus of the Court" in which the procedure followed by Vitro in the law on trade failures was detailed, indicating that it would free it of conventions signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Law on the failures.
Furthermore, it reports that the country has agreed with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equity for debtors and creditors.
Caramboling of two parties: they assume Vitro and assume the country.
General Country

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is my whole life"
The globe-trotator of the "Hetin" basketball Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the land and, thanks to him, has traveled throughout the world.
A few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as large as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain bleeding was condemned in 2008, Reyes was spent in this sport for more than 60 years, that it was as a player of lower links, player of the national basket team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros of Bayamon, or as a president of the basketball Federation.
"I have brought several caskets in the basketball all over my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, Director-General of the National Team and President of the Federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls at a visit of Primera Hora with him in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exhaust when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all cut off from photos and memories that remind his travel out of standards, testify to it.
Bayamón in the heart
From all his memories, those he loves most are those who remind him of his passport as player in the Vaqueros team in the middle of the years 50 to 1982, after having spent 15 years as a team manager or manager.
"This was my best years, those I've been most benefited because I had the chance to participate in eight campionships of the Vaqueros since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or manager.
This has been a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five campaigns discussed from 1971 to 1975.
Then I went back at the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the head of the team," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a cosud player for you, he measures two meters.
You want it?"
It's like that at the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best towers.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to get a championnate, Gausse would help us to try to get another.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only a distance because in 1988 he was already the large mantuo of the Federation.
At that time, he would prefer to benefit from his charges and Mincy's charges in the national team.
I remember when we received it for the first time in the United States during the pre-olympic tour in Mexico in 1989.
Then, there was the World of 1990, where we arrived 4th and where we should have received the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us enjoy the last match, Reyes said.
Is the world team of 1990 the best national team you have seen?
It is part of the best, just as the Dream Team held in the Olympics Games of 2004.
But my preferred is that of the Panama American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we got the gold and we put a race in the United States team, which was quite similar to the one who had received the bronze at the World.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Small" (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not assist the world of 90 because of a problem of gentlemen.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individus, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy in the pre-olympic tour of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Neves, Pablo Alice and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of players suspended by the imbroglio of the Panama American Games of Mar del Plata, we have received gold against all the prognoses.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
No doubt this is Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tours are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as Piculin did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different links for which he played.
Who was the best Portorican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Melléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armmandito Torres.
In young people, I love the job Leo Arrill.
For you, what is your greatest success in the Federation?
As part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, the fact that at the beginning of 1990, BSN was up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you still do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the boys of Ponce only play in their area and only face teams of the other corners of the island during national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for the leaders, the country staff and the artists.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
Generally, I hear of music, I look at clips of my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandparents, and, in time, I assist basketball matches.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Larry Hagman's death
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), was worldwide known by John Ross Ewing's main role, more known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he incarnated a man of unscrupulated business, redoutable and manipulating.
Larry Hagman, whose role of the magnitude of the oil without scrupules J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" has become a symbol of avaric in the 1980s, has been killed.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who was returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas", was dead Friday night of complications of cancer, a family member sent to The associated Press for the Warner Bros., "Dallas" production house.
"Larry was back in her dear city of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved most," said the family.
Larry's family and his neighbors were with him in Dallas on this celebrated day of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who involved the role of his wife in the original series and afterward, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas Hospital, said his press attachment, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, emotional, and talentably, and he's going to miss me very much.
"It was a person of exception and he lived the life in the ground," Gray said in a chairman.
The doctors had made a hepatic surgeon in Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had recognized that he had been drunk for many years.
In 1995, he was detected a bad tumor in the blood and he had been captured.
A few years before "Dallas", Hagman was known at the television in the role of a type of person in the "Jinny of my dreams" series distributed by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, a astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seduction geni, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought it back to him.
He also played in two commodities that remained a little time at the antine, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among its roles in the movie, there are well-obtained roles in the "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But this was through his judge's interpretation of the delicately hatable J.R. that Larry Hagman knew his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and their neighbors was spread from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?" invented to maintain the suspension around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's personality is almost killed, generated speculations throughout the world and millions of dollars played in pars.
Thanks to this, inter alia, the series has reached an audience record at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million televisors were in average before their ıran and made "Dallas" the second worldwide most entertainment programme, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million telespectors.
It was the beautiful sister of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot him.
J.R. had committed it and then threatened her to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others had reasons to attack her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatisfying man but in charismatic smile: an unfair entrepreneur and a spouse who tried to make his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it should be as an epipaphus for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "With the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman and a large man, both on the small and in life.
It is unforgettable, and unreplaceable, for millions of fans throughout the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new "Dallas" edition were spread a few months ago with a great success on the TNT chain.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, informed the chain.
For instance, neither the Warner nor the TNT chain have discussed how Hagman's death will be integrated in the series.
The originary of Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actor and song Mary Martin, who knows the collectivity with classic works such as "Suth" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her the day in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the scenes of the New York theater at the beginning of the 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956.
It's where he met the young Swedish internal decorative Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and had a lot of years in the California city of Malibu, where there are many collections.
In 2001, he entitled his memories "Hello Darlin': Tall (and absolutely true) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R.
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect it anyway," he said at the press at that moment.
After his liver record, he became an active military of the donation of organs and worked as voluntary in a hospital to assist those concerned.
"I advise them, I rely on them, I come with them when they come to work and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them a little comfort, as "Do not be afraid, it'll not be easy for a little while, but it'll be fine."
He was also combating tobacco and participated in several campaigns.
A traitor of the "World Fine" course just started
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germes and climate heating.
This semester, when the teacher of the religion Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world, knew that he launched there an irresistible hametion: the end of the "great decompute" of the calendary, Maya, on 21 December, which refers to many people as the evidence of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea of what he had to do during the following months: the Catastrophic Uragan Sandy, a fiscal golf that some called "The Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict that involved Israel, the place where the Christian theories at the end of the time thought that the apocalypse would be started.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester I never knew," Professor Charmé said this week to his students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we told it, it was a very good period.
And we need to remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in Apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last of the history.
At Temple, assistant teacher Barry Vacker spread the "Mediums, Culture and End of the world".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germes and climate heating.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate with time," he said, and how they offer hypothetic scenarios guide a certain hum's conduct.
If the nuclear army falls in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could blow out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic theme and study how they can be compared with real life examples.
"I tried to inform my students of what was possible, ≥, believable and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the Pennsylvania State University, Professor of History of Latin Matthew Re日 and his ́egue Amara Solari, an adjoined professor of Art History and Anthropology, made a team to give a course, just titled "The End of the World".
"We are "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world wouldn't disappear," said Professor Re®.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students have to study, create projects and oversee their final reviews.
In the Pennsylvania State, the final examination will pass the guard of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students other than working "to the evening of the end of the world", said Re.
The courses were very popular.
"It was complete in two hours," reaffirmed Re > about its course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received messages by e-mail several weeks before the beginning of the seventh, from people who asked if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I am fascinated to see what people can do to comfort," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old 23-year-old religious and sociology student, originating in Haddonfield, New Jersey, from the University of Rutgers-Camden.
Because the fear of Apocalypse, whether she is secular or religious, is only a question of comfort, or without comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and infermery student, states that he has viewed all the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of a course that teached this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students asked, and yet less than one teacher, told us to believe at the date of the end of the world on 21 December.
"Our first project was the Maya prophecy, and in a certain way we discreded it," says Julie Zegle, student of the last year in Temple, 21 years old and originating from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Re.
But I agree that there is an anxiety related to the Apocalypse in Western culture, which is up to several centuries, which makes people respond to the changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a resort of these speculations.
"In other places of the world, people don't think about it," he assures.
This is most of the anglophone world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University The Room who provides courses to the Philippines this year, replied quickly when he was asked if he knew that we were given courses on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines don't participate in the end of the world," he answered us, as if it was a exception from a higher authority.
We have a thanks to Daddy.
Re* notes that in the past years, many dates of the last judgment have been discussed, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, "the people will immediately begin to think at the next date" or to philosopher about the fact that on December 21, the beginning of a period of 7 years to the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date at the stage.
Many told us that they thought to go to "the end of the world" festivals.
"I'm sometimes calling friends, and we're doing it in ○," Samira Ford commented, a 20-year-old student in communications.
