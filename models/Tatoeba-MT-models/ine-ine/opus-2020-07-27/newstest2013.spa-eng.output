A Republican strategy to obstacle Obama's reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy for the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this last a myth and that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die due to the fall of a radius.
In fact, the Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is true: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, these measures will be partly reduced by the American Democratic System.
In contrast to what is happening in Canada, the American States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line, most of the American governments, since 2009, promoted new laws that difficulted the inscription or voting process.
This phenomenon has been extended after the elections of November 2010, which have seen the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 law projects were introduced in 2011 to restrict the exercise of voting right in 41 states.
The new electoral law requires electors to present an identity document with a graphy, as well as a test of American citizenship.
On the other hand, those laws reduce the previous voting periods, invalidate the right to register themselves as electors on the day of the slave and return their right to vote to citizens with criminal advances.
Before the elections of 2006, no American state requested the electors to present a graphical identity document.
The Indian State was the first in it.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana law.
Therefore, the Republican authorities were quick to extend that practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported draft law in 34 states to force electors to present a graphical identity document.
It is important to note that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, the American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Card of Social Security.
In fact, 11% of the American citizens, namely 21 million voting age, do not account for any identity document with graphy issued by a governmental agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new electors in 2012 lack a identity document with these features.
However, obtaining the required identity document costs more than 100 dollars.
Thus, new restrictions affect young people, minorities and low income.
In fact, 25 per cent of Africans, 15 per cent of people who win less than $35,000 per year, 18 per cent of citizens of over 65 years and 20 per cent of electors between 18 and 29 years are not accounted for a graphical identity document.
And there's still more.
In many states, students who vote most to democratic candidates cannot use the identity document with graphics issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of the fishing clubs or the fishing clubs to vote to the Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required the proof of citizenship to vote.
Ar ́na was the first state in presenting that requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen of states have adopted laws that require electors to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly seeking to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two of each three Spanish electors support the democratic party.
On the other hand, the Republican legislators supported certain laws that rejected the registration of electors on the same day of the slave in eight states.
Furthermore, they limited the right of people and groups to create aid service to electors who wanted to be registered.
These restrictions have effects.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, the electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have concluded that the rate of registration of new electors would fall in 2010 in comparison with 2006.
Furthermore, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that promoted the reduction of the voting period for the future.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the electors who voted forward were African, while these were not more than 13 per cent of the state electors.
In the case of the Spanish, it was exactly the same.
These represent no more than 11% of the electors, which is 24% of the citizens who vote forward.
However, whites, representing 76% of the electorate, represent no more than 46% of the citizens who vote forward.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their parties have been irregularly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of electors.
In this regard, the Democratic Governors have locked several legislative projects.
The United States Fisheries Ministry intervenes to suspend the most controversy laws.
In part, the damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 of 34 States adopted the law that requires the presentation of a graphical identity document.
However, it is unnecessary that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of voting right in 2012.
Democratic critics claim the partist character of the laws that have been voted, since it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in the key states.
A report from the Centre Brennan of 2011 shows that the states adopted by these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary at the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too quick to ensure whether these electoral legislative amendments will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections of 2012.
One thing is true: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, the measures will in part minimize the American democratic system.
Detection of prostat cancer: Is the test done or not?
In fact, the PSA test presents sometimes wrong results with negative results or even positive results, after which it is decided to carry out unusual medical interventions.
It is a more than enough reason to make men doubts about whether the detection tests should be done or not.
Do the test or not?
We have requested advice to two experts.
In the studies in the United States, a large number of figures between sample groups was detected, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to make firm recommendations.
In its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality among patients who had been detected and who were not.
The study, with a follow-up of 12 years, also showed that there was between 30% and 40% of the potential for metastasis if the detection test had not been performed.
So I recommend the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if your father has suffered prostat cancer.
African men of origin have a higher risk.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to achieve that the patient understands the risk level of his cancer. It should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostat cancers that do not care for long-term life, in the case of which it should be chosen better by an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been detected a cancer are not treated because that cancer is not aggressive or causes a risk for their lives.
Instead, we propose an active monitoring of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer them a treatment.
We determine more frequently the criteria necessary to determine who should be treated or not.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urology Society, a tool to evaluate PSA test pros and contrasts.

Prevention of illness
Unfortunately, there is no wonderful receipt to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering of disease.
We believe that if everyone eats well and moves enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If nobody smoke, that rate would be raised at least 50%," underlined André Beaulieu, Canadian Society's carrier against Cancer.
Instead, we evaluate that about 10% of cancers are inheriting.
Many others are still totally unexplainable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against tobacco continues to be a priority despite the decrease of the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It is extremely harmful to people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said the portfolio André Beaulieu.
A hoped data: 10 years after stop smoking, the risk of cancer death is reduced to half.
The weight
Grass and obesity also promote the appearance of the disease, is the SCC.
Increases the risks of mother cancer, colon and right, shofage, pancreas and use.
"The research shows that regular physical activity practice throughout the life protects from mother cancer," adds.
Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of suffering of a color-rectal cancer.
Carcutary products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat for its haumed, dry or salmon can cause the formation of cancer substances.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In the past years, several scientists have studied the links between the complete vitamins and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not concluding.
Following SCC, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostat cancer, in another, it was noted, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about concerns and families with your doctor.
"Doing the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
The detailed Higgs box
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boss generated a great conmotion last summer, and reasonably.
In fact, this boss is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
Moreover, it is the part of which the standard model predicted: our best or "minder bad" explaining the nature and behaviour of the material, which has not yet been observed empirely.
But for physicians it's not absolutely clear that it's Higgs.
We certainly know that there is a new part and that it looks very like Higgs' boss predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, new data discovered this week at an important conference of physics held in Kioto seem to confirm that it is, although there are still more data to be completely safe.
In any way, we assume that it's Higgs, because the possibilities of failure seem little.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and unfair law that means that two things cannot be found at the same time.
There is no way of infringing that standard and not too understanding it, because it will end making it damage.
Although the physics of the parts are a very complete world, it has also been demonstrated that there is a law of these characteristics: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which suggests that two particulates cannot take the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantic state"; a "status" which consists, largely, of some of their characteristics.
Physicians classify parts in two categories.
On the one hand, we met the good citizens called farmers, who are wisely obedient to Pauli's beginning.
And on the other hand, they are the couchs, a sweet panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found at the same place and at the same time.
It is the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories that, in fact, is extraordinary, the bodies are divided into two groups: the months, of which we do not talk here, and the "power parts" that the large forces of nature are spread and with which Higgs' bosson would be somehow empered.
These youths, I'd be able to subray here, are not the exotic bicks we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, it is thanks to a extraordinary banal boss: the foton or the "light part" that acts as "messager" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particulate with a load speeds or changes direction, "deorder" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we lay a stone to a stone.
In this "deorde" is born a electromagnetic wall (of light, infrared, ultraviolets, etc.), and this wall is nothing but a foton; it is, one of the "power porters".
Stablest Field
It happens the same with the Higgs boss, with the difference that it is of another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "unsorted" to appear this boss.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it needs to reach extremely high energy, a little as if it was a iron stone in which only a gross rock could be scrolled through the surface.
That is why there is a great accelerator of parts like the CERN (the large hadrone collisionator is a 27 km wing!) to reach such energy levels.
Analogia with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all parts or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as imanes, do it, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never be kept at the door of a neck.
And in the same way, not all parts interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the rest (as the photo, certainly), they do not have it.
What, though, can you bring all these investigations?, Mrs. Plamondon asks.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS) and also allows physicians to escape the differences between observations and MS predictions.
For their part, many want to be found, because the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physical" that touchs certain bubbles of the model.
This, it must be said, has yet a huge deficiency, as it does not propose any explication on the seriousness (ups!) or the dark material, which matches about 80% of the universe's material (other ups!).
But we haven't found such differences in the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these investigations today are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that there will be no one.
In order to see: at the beginning of the 60s, laser pioners in the ladies were not absolutely suspicious of the revolution that their work would cause.
They interviewed citizens, but nothing else.
In fact, as the physician Willard Boyle said, who worked at the Bell Bells, where the laser was invented in 1960, and that developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, the laser was in the beginning as well considered as a "a device of lust".
Imagine...
Moreover, applications can also result from all the instruments around the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle designed a light captain in 1969 through its optical research.
Although it was not absolutely its original intention, this captator now serves "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which was worth the Nobel of physicalness in 2009.
That doesn't mean, of course, that LHC's activities would necessarily want to transform our lives, but that you never know...
Palative cares. The best way to die...
In his committee Death in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be repeated soon as a draft law is prepared.
However, within that essential dominion, there is still much to do.
The Devoir has seen him looking at him.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived only in his apartment of Montérégie.
The prostat cancer that was destroying him had given him a breath of two years.
"They had given me five years of life, but I had already taken the same seven," she reported, made a pass, thrown in her bed in the center of Palatitive care of Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, to which he arrived on the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be ready for this," she continues.
The illness has caused you to be disturbed: a huge deficiency that prevents you to go alone to the bathroom and even eat for yourself.
Seated before a pleasant dinner, accepted resigned to help you eat.
Calm, even laughing, talking to the unknown who take attention to you, bringing her medicines and offering a bathroom.
The courage of death.
"My biggest desire is to cure my diarrhoea, it's humiliating," she admits.
A few hours later, the team found a medication for that bad.
"In the course of our lives, we will make a man standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the Victor-Gadbois center.
Regarding their childhood, for certain people, is an inacceptable humility.
"This depends on the ability of the person to accept that regression," he notes.
Because, the view of most people who work in palatiative care is made, the great moments are happening in the heart of that return.
All patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palatiative care centre suffer cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and doctors that surround them no longer offer "curative care".
The biggest fear of Mrs. A., 89 years old, is to die "conscious and hot".
But the illness has made you discover your children.
"I have good kids," adds.
"I don't have any more desires in this life," he says, "before accepting that you put a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next days, a last visit of your son living in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, the body's care and food support is offered.
They are paliative cares that are given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help your death be more comfortable.
In Quebec, we have a palatiative care bed for each 11.700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we know that we're all going to die on a day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the centre.
Be at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
To the dead, it is offered mouth games with brandy or Pepsi, if it is requested.
The diabetes are no longer controlled by their sugar rates.
Death is part of the daily.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died through the night.
This morning, your son finished the beer at the feet of the dead.
"We help both patients and their dear beings," reports Nathalie Savard, care director.
In the Victor-Gadbois center the days passed without being never equal.
On the side of a 94-year-old man who saved his last family in the park, well placed among his holidays while everyone drinks for his health, a 36-year-old young man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after having kept it all to survive.
"For six months ago, there are always three to five beds occupied by more than 45 years of cancer," Dr. Christiane Martel is concerned.
53% of patients admitted at the Victor-Gadboisarrivent centre come from their home and 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to palative care
A 77% of the Canadians simply have no access to paliative care, namely, to the cares designed to alive the suffering when a person reaches the terminal phase of their life, whether in his home, hospital or in a centre of care.
And several organisms, such as the Victor-Gadbois centre and the Palative Care Society at the Grand Montréal home, are almost specialized in the care of cancer patients.
It is exactly that great deficiency related to Quebec's health care, which makes many specialised doctors in palatiative care fear the adoption of a law regulating eutanase and assisted suicide.
Since October, a evidence signed by eminences of palatiative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, was to demonstrate its opposition to such initiative.
Dr. Christiane Martel, the healthy system of Quebec is not sufficiently competent to ensure that any person has the right to paliating quality care before it is accepted to proceed with Eutanasia.
"Recently," reports, "I have seen a patient spent 14 days in Urgency suffering great pain without having done what is necessary to aliviate it.
I'm afraid patients want to die only because they don't receive proper care."
And parallelly, many oncologists are obstined with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predicts.
Helène Richard's super-hope expectations were already lower when he left a deep chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my onchologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me she was giving her a lot of pain that I wanted to stop fighting," she reported.
"But, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There are no all-powerful careers
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the demanding to die thanks to their careers that they haven't made their requests once their pain has been dealed with a paliative care team.
But it is necessary to say that paliative cares are not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
See Elsie Monereau, director of the Palative care at Grand Montréal home, patients do not respond to the treatment against pain in 8% of the cases.
At the end of the life, the doctors are trying to recover the palative sedition, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of their death, either sprayfully or permanently.
We cannot conclude that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Each time again, the non-aliased disease will have the possibility to have that paliative sedition.
Those who are not aliviated say all the same: "I want to die."
But that doesn't mean necessarily "I'm Eutanasia", but "I guess I'm alive."
The implementation of this report has been possible through a magazine of the Canadian health research institutions.
Grand widespread immobiliary scandals in Quebec
Travel network officers, BTP firms, assets of political and specialists of the Italian mafia, count, day by day, what they know of an amazing "a", of which they are part of the construction industry, officers, politicians, sindicals and mafialists.
A "industrie" which was too deep to the Chebequens contributors, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's interesting how the system pulls once we've hunted the big media," Jacques Duchesneau ironises, a member of Quebec and an old chief of the Montreal Police.
He led the scandal extent in 2011, which was possible by a basic investigation on the crimes related to road contracts in Quebec, which the Prime Minister of Liberal Library at that time, Jean Charest, had not been more than delayed.
The "Information of Duchesneau" established a direct link between the industry, the clandestin financing of parties and the corruption between officers.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have been awarded billion dollars in contracts," containing some of its instincts to stay with a proportional part.
The Charbonneau Commission " has already fallen to two hosts", adds, while it expects to come to "demonstrate existing strategy behind individuals".
A permanent anticorruption unit created in 2011
The Permanent Anticorruption Unit, established in 2011, is also applied with its team of interventors, researchers and analystes of the Government.
This unit works in addition to the Police of the Marteau Square, which since 2009 have made Montreal's "captarillad card" moderate at the time of contracting.
In recent weeks, the unit has been registered in series of accusations for fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, head of a city of the outside.
The next of the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just released from his headquarters of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspicious that it has been repeatedly paid to the exchange of public contracts.
It has been formally accused of traveling engineers from Montreal and Italian companies, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia.
This last has caused conmotion by explaining to the committee the mechanism of public contracts.
He himself paid for three years a 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia intermediate that transfered money to Union Montreal, the party of Colonel Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambiat distributed money in the 2000s, which has been assigned over $88,000 Canadians (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincies, especially the liberals in the power.
He also agreed to have organised a collection of illegal funds for the former liberal minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
The inflation of the cost of the contracts of claiming contracts
In Montreal, corruption "a" worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, extinguishing public works, explained it perfectly before the committee: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travelling, golf tours, restaurants, hokey party partys and building companies for a total of $6.000, all of this in exchange of accommodation contracts whose costs were affected.
Other travel network officers have admitted that they have received money for overflowing the factures between 30% and 40% in terms of extra Property.
Furthermore, Martin Dumont, an organizer of the lawyer party, accused Mr. Tremblay that he had determined to see a parallel budget and filled his arches with sucking money.
Based on these revelations, Mr. Tremblay released at the beginning of November and brought Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first election policies in Montreal that made the alarm sound.
As a host of the Rivière-des-Prairies is in the east of the island, it has been opposed to the sale of a municipal land purchased by $5 million and returned by $1.6 million to the promotors in full immobiliary boom.
70% of the electoral campaigns' money was suicide money
From the research that finally will be carried out, she assures that it is "of a thickness to understand the function of the system, infiltrated by wheat, to stop the gangreen and to fish the guilty".
And adds that the process is "worrying, but positive".
We are doing the wounds but there would be a need for a research unit in Montreal and be very alert that doubt practices should not be repeated.
How to do the deal.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, on its part, states that "the officers have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of the "political elections at the stream of the strategy".
Assessing 70% of the proportion of suicide money intended for the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironised: "I have said that it is not more than a painful reflection of the reality."
The Quebeque Government proposes to limit 100 dollars the donations to parties, but this will not change the donation, if it is, "without the electoral costs are strictly limited, there will be suicide in the policy".
It provides a complete review of the system of public contracts and financing of parties: "We can't fall low; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story emphasizes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who would look at the speech.
"The PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This season has bought a new with the PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual concept of consciousness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Day-to-day forward at your side.
Technical staff has also brought me a lot.
And these elements move me daily to increase the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything's going quickly on the football.
But I don't get back.
Since my beginning in the INF Preformation Centre to my step through Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed to aggressive steps.
It will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
The reclutes of this summer are used to dispute lots of very high level.
They know each training is crucial.
That makes a player like me enjoy fighting and giving everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti offers me much about my position.
It is supported by attachments like Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man he needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all techniques.
Today, there is no one equal to Liga 1 and is among the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with the best clubs.
He worked with big players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of lessons.
Your confidence in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think of the PSG at the first part of the season?
At Liga 1, Lyon has removed our leader position.
But we continue in the ambassador.
One of our biggest goals is the campaign Liga: we have classified us for the octaves of the final style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have much to say before many and very good European teams.
We want to, to start, end the first of our liaison towards the Port to get the octaves of the end.
Can the PSG become a large European club at short term?
You've already got the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and be long-term.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is delivered to its means so that this project is concrete.
Don't win the coffee in Liga 1, like at the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year, we will invest all our efforts to carry out this campaign title.
We didn't get far at the last season.
In May, we had a disappointment, since we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We ended with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been campaigns...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a lot better season.
This year I think it'll be the good one.
Even if big teams such as Marsella, Lyon and Burdeos fight for the title, I think we're counting with the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media are waiting for more than PSG?
It's normal that they expect a lot of us if we think of what has been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 home to Troyes, which are still found with things that reproach us is a little frustrating.
We're wondering how much more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to run a game project.
A team is built with time.
We have shown that we can answer and be present in the campaign Liga.
Look at Manchester City that, after two seasons, has not been able to classify for eights of the end, and they have also invested very much!
In view of the invested amounts, we would imagine you with 15 advantage points at the day.
That would disobey our opposers and the French campaign.
Lyon and Marsella, who were not well the previous season, have been seen "impulsed" by this new PSG.
That shows that Liga 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all difficulties, we have completed the trophee.
The PSG seems completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's success.
Better than say we have a Zlatandependence.
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and that I have many goles.
He's coming to show that it's the star of Liga 1.
And she has demonstrated in all the teams that has happened to be a big player, a world star.
In the group, we respect man and player.
And he also respects men around him.
What you've done is really emotional.
This enables others to increase their game level.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defensors of the world, also allows us to progress.
How did you live Eurocopa 2012 with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocope.
Unfortunately, my disappointment prevented me from accumulating time of game.
I saw things and I went out strengthened.
Today I can play good games in the selection.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the blues.
We learn the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and this must be an example of behavior today.
What vision do you have in the first month of Didier Deschamps before the "blaus"?
You're getting results.
They are well held in the World Classification Group.
The selector is rigorous, near players and inspires to win.
As was the case of Laurent Bla.
But I don't want to compare.
Bla has achieved its goal to classify us for Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the selection to Brazil.
The empathe (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to sit down the bases?
That game gave us trust.
Everyone fighted for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn't lived a game like this in all my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without
Any contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central transactions, identified transactions and processing loads between parties.
Moreover, as often occurs in technologies, political vision is pampable: the conviction that the current monetary system, consisting of monopolies, leads to financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonimo), is at the same time a conversional currency to dollars, euros, etc. and a safe exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files to be equal.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have been registered thanks to 15,000 network computers.
And approximately a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The bitcoin quotation, after reaching $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to the $10 today (countries are censed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is nothing impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on the monetary currency published in October.
In it, the bitcoin was described as "the most successful currency", "which computes with the dollar or the euro" and "like the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other systems with types of monetary types such as the "credits" used to progress in a video game and that can be won by playing or buying (and even changing).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in all exchanges, a central authority controls and treats changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are rather than accounting books, checkers, currency and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, guaranteeing the anonymous.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically to ≥ a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the transaction's ability.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins contain in the public account book, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key hito consists of writing that new transaction in that book.
This will take place by the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and winners, a kind of temporary central banker, the privilege of adding that supplementary line.
It is a stage of file browsing, namely, of transformation of a large file in a shorter and unique numeric floor.
Computers "cogen" the new transaction and add a number before "trocear" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a special hole ( more zero at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is good.
The transaction is then unstructiblely linked to the set of other transactions; any change would change the floor.
If, in order to commit a fraud, a user would like to pay two times with the same very fast money (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would remain poor, because both have different floods.
The computer that resolves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this reverse is divided in two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
Thus, the number of bitcoins is limited to 21 million, but they are deep to the cent million, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also shown in each increase in the calculation power.
The network's life has its highs.
The websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and stolen in deposit bitcoins.
"The failure used does not affect the same protocol," assured Pierre Noizat, which just started Paymium, a real currency paying company using the Bitcoin network.
In addition, the ECB takes into account the possibilities of white money through this anonymous service.
But the money in reality represents the same defect.
Weight sharers such as Wikipedia pay the payments of this type.
Others, such as Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Sha and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analysed the accountability book and showed that about 80% of bitcoins was not.
In November, the "gigant rebases" were launched.
"30,000 dollars have changed," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, turns the bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogic book on that currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as well as in the transaction network.
Your system, Paytunia, is equal to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but use Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are more beautiful.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain in the anonimation.
The system is easy to run in trades, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
They are enough to provide a address that a phone can "fotograph and recognize", needs Pierre Noizat, which makes sure to have thousands of users.
There is a general revision of hierarchy systems by more horizontal systems.
"They will need a while to make Bitcoin up, but in 2013 there could be a change," she foretold.
On the other hand, in its report, the ECB intends to re-evaluate the different risks today considered high, if this currency has success.
We've been out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their responsibility area in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
The NATO and the Americans must exit at the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghanistan Army renew the possession of its territory and the Afghanistan choose their future, without waiting for anything of us.
We have punished the Afghanistan campaigns, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to us, with our 88 murdered soldiers, more the wounds and the mutilated.
The Taliban accounts for foreign extremists and ancient leaders repeated in Pakistan, but often also with campsinos who have the presence of the foreign army, such as in the days of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaeic, even if the yihadists, Pakistanians, Arabs, Uzbekistans or Tayikos are joined to their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, these will no longer be when the Westers are more discrete.
The department of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted by the French loans, was made by order.
The trucks and tanks convoys returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, monitored by the helicopters.
There will be no Taliban affliction in Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed from their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country enveloped in fire and blood because of fighting between different factors.
Its control of the country was considered as a kind of freedom, the return to security.
Afghanistans have paid the price of the darkness of their campsite overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
Old polyhaidines, the current government and the current Taliban are the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the antisoviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making governmental lands to sell them as solars for re-flying from Iran and Pakistan, benefits to a couple of large contracts and subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not struck.
People, if I have heard in the field, encourage a government that is not formed by latrons.
Many young people want to leave, as well as those who have learned to benefit from the American generosity: the escape of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideology.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have made their advantages.
With approximately 65% of its 25-year-old population, Kabul has now 5 million inhabitants, a fifth part of the total population.
In the cities, state colleges are filled with both girls and children.
Young people who will not want to return to the darkness of ancient parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are aware of mobile phones. The television and its Turkish follets presenting a modern world have great admirators throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to lead the country be considered legally?
Ancient antisoviet fighters are concerned about rebuilding the provincies, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation at the image of the west nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, deleting the position of the Prime Minister since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially because of the elections provided in April 2014.
However, its country depends on foreign aid since the years 50 and even before.
No industry has restored its services, no emballage has been corrected or the important irrigation systems have been corrected.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is given to the private initiative.
In a devastated country after 30 years of war, governmental control would have been necessary.
The voice that Afghanistan possessed great mineral riches was extended.
And that did not make it more than to increase the feeling that the Westers were to get to them.
No energy for the extract of iron or cover minerals from the ground and without transport means to export them to the mountains, there is no mineral explosion.
Chinese have almost abandoned Mes Aynak's cover mines, allowing international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to extinguish the large bubby site and remain there as the most important employees of the province.
It will also require that Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country of which imports and exports are largely restored their normal relations.
The French troops departed on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls, children's colleges, a French department at university, the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural areas, and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of "gaining the hearts and the spirits" and to perform the impossible task to make aid and official actions match, a service for civil and military action from the Defence Ministry (Cimic), deleted in 2012, brought and brought to ≥ a small French NGO of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation activities in decades of mountains.
These works, greedy to get the hand of local work, have been able to help contain insurrection: river, powder, potable water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and growing culture surfaces.
What will we leave as I remember after two million euros of military expenditure?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local life conditions, very hard in these valleys often at more than 2,000 metres of high.
Embajada received decades of written applications with small agricultural proposals made by local communities of the province of Kapisa.
In order to be released from the insurrection carried out by the foreign groups, something that the agricultors said to me that they wanted, it would need to keep a small, well-controlled civil aid and to reach them directly.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever about the constitutional declaration, which gives him provisionally full powers, he decided to play all things in all.
He took all the world by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constitutional Assembly would vote on its final text on the next day.
Just one week ago, the State head had given that Assembly two months more to finish his work.
And nearly two years ago Egypt uses a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial embarrassment.
This new initiative has made no more than to increase the fraction in the country.
For his opposers, the president continues in his "autocratic delirium" and continues "training his word" and "picking the right".
Its partners ensure that it is a measure to end more rapidly with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
A referencendum should be organized in the next 15 days.
A very short time lapse that forces the brothers to refuse their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimation while the polemic causes strike throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for their favor, as he said in an interview on the American Time weekend.
Since this resource has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or they vote on my text or keep the full powers," powers that will probably reach its end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment where 85 members of this Constitutional Assembly, islamic in its large majority, voted the text yesterday.
The majority of the liberals did not come to the convocation.
At midnight of November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they thought they could not make their views worth.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons, substituted members, were approved yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As I was able to wait, the voted articles have been a singleness.
The commentators, on the other hand, appreciate the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day had been expressed almost at the time of prayer, so that several members of the committee thought that the constitutionary hour was bad.
The text, which was still voting last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 object of all views, remains finally identical to the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of the Islamic Law was a fundamental reivulation, hoped that "the principles" could be substituted by "the standards", which would have allowed a more strict application.
For islamists, that this article has not been modified, is a guarantee of their good will and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
Liberals turn it out of hypocresy and consider it is not more than a public size.
They are, the islamization of the Constitution is made to other articles.
In particular, Article 220 is referred to as a consultative role to the University of Al-Azhar, particularly for all who have to confirm their conformity with Sharia's laws.
The specialist in Egypt, Soe Pommier, is anxious because "the people called to speak are not chosen and have no democratic legitimateness.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy."
Furthermore, the fears of the liberals are increased by the fact that the next director of that university would be far less moderate than the current.
"For now there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, we are in the framework of the civil state.
The majority of the jurists who have worked in that text are not ulems but universitaries, some of them formed in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, preparing a tesis on the constitutional transition of Egypt.
But you recognize that there may be a certain ambition in turn to article 220 because the terms employed imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We are particularly referring to the term iqh [islamic jurisdiction, ndlr].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be in what measure the civil judges are competent to speak above all of this."
In addition to its religious nature, the voted text yesterday has received many criticisms relating to the extensive powers that he grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers will claim that they are few in comparison with those who were during the previous regime.
Other conflicting point: the powers conferred to the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military, the revision of the Defence budget will not be subject to Parliament, but to a national defence advice.
The processing of civilians in military courts, as requested by human rights associations, will not also be held.
These also showed their concerns regarding the text, which they considered freedom.
The crime of blasphemia is maintained and, from now on, the insults are insults, which could cause serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially the pressure.
Furthermore, no article emphasizes the protection of women, highlights Haba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
In the case of her, the only positive was the torture in accordance with Article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president had to go out last night in the television, manifestations for this midnight were provided.
The party officers of the State head were shown on the Sabbath.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect the holy land, the obscurity of the world, and a sea of salmon
The Promised Earth combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and a natural pristine.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Earth
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "bautismal pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine in the wedding, walking over the waters, the pasture of the storm and the filled networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places is located in Jerusalem.
The believers run here the Viacrucis or the Path of Jesus ’ Property (in Latin "Vía Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortaleza of Antonio, the Pretorium, where the judgment was fulfilled, and continues through the streets of the Via City, goes to the Holy Sepulture in the Mount Golgota, the place of the cross, the Stone of the Unity and the place of Jesus ’ sepulture.
In this same place, there is also the true Christian Obligation of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy One in Jerusalem, built in the place where there was a Christian legend, there was a tree of which the cross was made for the cross of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place for the Jews, the wall of the Lamentations; the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their desires, which then will become real.
Highlight a vertical travel
The ruins of Masada Fortaleza was what remained from a secret king against the enemies, which Herod the Great commanded to build in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in the mountains at a height of 450 m above the sea level.
And get to there by their own means, only those who are devoted to the scale.
Others can reach this historical summary in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at a height of 1600-2040 m, there is the highest station of Hermon Squi, where in winter months there is a huge bullet of tourists.
Even there, from the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski tracks is 45 km.
There is an ancient legend on the top of the mountain, probably, lived Gentiles.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit them all on one travel.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is Israel’s Museum, near the Knesset (Israélite Parlament).
The ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Rollos of Qumran are maintained in the wilds of the wilderness of Judea, and about 500 thousand archeological and antropological parts.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel A.
In your exposure to paintings, you have a link of impresionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Bathroom Museum Al Basha, which are some of the old Turkish bathrooms with model figures of visitors and banists of that time.
In Cesarea the pen is worth passing through the private Museum Ra, where the cultures of Rodin and Dalí can be admirated.
There are no tourist guides or tents of events there.
Input is free, and donations are not accepted categoryally.
The fifth, the Holocausto Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel A日, shows one of the most dramatic pages of the history.
The most tragic section is the Memorial of children, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration fields and gas cameras.
Enter it and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars will be.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their life.
Ucrania is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located at the edges of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are pools, aquatic parks, delfinary and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea are driving even in winter months, since the water temperature does not below 21 degrees and the air is heated up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is still warmer and there are bathrooms all the year.
True, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located on the lowest point of the planet: 417 m below the sea level.
The waters from there are a salmwater that easily sustains until those who don't know breathing.
The landscapes of the surroundings are really beautiful.
People come here to pass treatment courses with salted water, salmonary and healing bars and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asma, echema, artrite, bronchitis, diabetes and to order their broken nerves.
Playing mysteries of anti-economy
Conserve them the old part of Tel A, the city of Jaffa, in the Mediterranean Coast.
It passed by the great seaway that joined Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
It is recorded the legend, where Noah built his ark and Perseo saved the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in the same place, he brought a long and happy life.
Tourists like to pass through the east streets carrying the names of the Zodiaco signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your mystic symbol, the happiness will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa, a couple of recently married couples come from everywhere from Israel, and even from other countries to photograph.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, it can pass through the Roman theater, "taking" the strength of the crossed.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Poncio Pilato.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera spectacles.
Turists Remember
If you travel to Israel, you don't worry if your English leaves much to wish: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this travel is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be changed to shekels (currently $1-3.8 shekels).
The urban transport is mainly composed of buses, but there is a quick travel in Jerusalem and in Haifa is located the only metro line of the country, which consists of six stations and the low city with the High City.
Actually, it's from a subterraneous funicular.
To travel in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price it can be traveled through 1,5 hours.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is held, the Sabbath is celebrated.
Since Friday night to Sunday sunset, markets and tents are closed and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning starts a new working week.
In many coffees, restaurants and hotels only serves cosher food, which excludes green meat, sea, fishing without scames and plats where milk and meat are combined.
There is offered a wide selection of plates based on bovine and lamb meat, sopes and posts prepared with coco milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a large variety of salts, the falafel, which are molly wheat bottles, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of the Israelites, no traveling dogs are seen.
Instead, there are many well-food cats that "pass to their pleasure" in imponent way.
On the night, you can see them sleeping even on the tissues of the parked cars.
Ronadors love the concurred places and do not assemble golosin.
The rental of a car, depending on the mark, will cost $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) daily.
Besides the insurance, it's going out for $15 per day.
And the winner of a bicycle will go out for 15 shekels on the day.
The entry into museums covers a average of 30 shekels.
Israel in digits
In 2012, more than three million tourists around the world visited Israel.
Most of those who arrived to recover the country and relaxed were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8000 Ukrainian tourists, which exceeded 51% at the same year 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will bring you to Moscow: immigrants will reproach for the language
While human rights members and defenses discuss the consequences that would lead to the obligation examination law, they have already appeared in the timer country who trade with "false" certificates.
Each year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, San Petersburg and other Russian cities.
In most of them they are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tahikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to win money to help your families who have stayed home.
Since 1 December, a law enters into force, where each employee immigrant must take an exam to check its knowledge of Russian language.
This rule is currently applicable only to those who intend to work in the provisions sector, Community services institutions, household services and smaller trade.
However, with time, as they promised in the Federal Imigration Service, the examinations will be made obligatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, it will not be enough to render the language examination, unless also the Russian history and the legislation's basis.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the authorisation of work.
They are citizens of the countries where the Russian is official language.
This law shall not be subject to persons who have been able to obtain their educational certificates and diplomas before the resolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of research centres will work by the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of the Amistat of the Pueblos, the State University of Moscow, the State University of San Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can be presented to tests in all towns, and now in Russia are more than 160 centers of this type.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by Members of the State Duma and by the Federal Imigration Service.
But the rights defenders, long before the law entered into force, have often been able to ask the press: and what will this actually bring?
What changes will bring the obligation of knowledge of the language, both for Russian and for their own immigrants?
First, the representatives of the Imigration Service are responsible, and this will reduce the number of people suffering from "work slavery".
Many people today speak about the defence of the rights of work immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tahikistan.
The defence of their rights should be started before its departure.
Only one organized selection system will allow immigrant workers to solve the problem in 90% of the cases.
Problems have immigrants without profession, education, who do not know the language or who are in medical control.
Without understanding the tongue, Sebelev, the immigrant future will be condemned to find people without slaves who, with the pretext of help, put a "paid trip" to a speechful and is covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive a summary of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their country they promise one thing, but when they come, they are disappointed, they do not pay their promised salaries," confirms the Chief of the Working Inmigration Direction of the Tahikistan Imigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't worry, boss!
However, while so many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also in their own language they write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much your fault but its own unfortunateness: the Turkmen, Uzbek, Tayikos that can be given the light of receiving normal primary education.
This is why your families do not even have anything to give children to eat, because they don't talk about them, clothe them and buy them what is needed for school.
When they arrive to adolescence, these guys are able to work at the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, you recognize them.
"One feels humble and lower."
However, as regards the Language Law, the rights defensors have a significant point.
The examinations will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no exam and, accordingly, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or becoming the pass to strangers"
Many visitors have found that receiving the official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language in itself.
Moreover, legalization costs money: from 12000 to 16000 rulls.
However, an inscription can be made quickly and for only a thousand fifty rulls.
Russian police employees know that we usually take documents, we are not inscribed and the cases of extortion appear.
"We ask hundred or two hundred rubbles for cigarettes or te," commented the journalists in Tayikisthan, Umed Hushkadamov.
"Come on, don't be tired, buy a painting."
On the first day of entry into force of the Language Law, it was shown that not only the registered documents of immigrants could be found.
A number of "false" language knowledge certificates have already been charged by the Federal Immigration Service officers.
The documents were printed in standard color printers.
Of course, they reached the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrator, wanting to facilitate the task to pass the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rules.
This is two and a half more decent than the official examination procedure, which will cover the immigrant worker three thousand rules.
The main task for a future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomes" cannot be purchased, converge government officers and rights defenders.
At the same time, the authorities may promise immigrant workers that they would not have been able to take the first time to study the basic language course.
Furthermore, non-Russian immigrants will be offered jobs that do not repeat active communications with people.
The Ministry of Industry does not take drastic measures against illegal weapons trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite reduced
The Ministry of Industry proposes to implement the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of civil use weapons.
This is the reaction of the government to recent incidents: To learn shots during breakfast celebrations in which there were no victims, and the massacre started by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Seven people lost life.
The police wants to use and hold traumatic weapons in public places and to increase the minimum age for license to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Conflict against Corruption, Irina Yarobaya, who promised that reforms in the Law on Armen Position would be brought to the Duma of the State in a near future.
Not all are pleased with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to cope with this problem by applying the "hard hand policy".
There has been a open letter on the network, whose authors, representatives of a number of social organisations of actors, require that it be dismissed from such measures of "insignificant rigorosity".
The percentage of vandalism acts with registered weapons is minimum, commented to the BBC news service, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
Statistics of the Ministry of Industry have been made for six months in 2012 142 crimes with firearms registered in internal bodies, against the total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that a more strict legislation in the civil use weapons sector will not be an inconvenience in order to address the criminal to the black market.
Now, it is your words, in Moscow you can find any weapons under price.
Meanwhile, in the Ministry of the Interior, the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Providers: from factories to officials
The black weapons market is assigned to several channels.
The main channels are years, says Victor Baranets Coronel, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and High State.
Screenshot of the website accepting weapons requests
The first, "factor of exercise or military" means the weapons that were stolen during military action in the Caucaso.
"The weapons were hurt by the Russian officers and the same cacasic officers," says Baranets.
The following type of black weapons, stolen by criminals and representatives of security forces.
Baranets explains that here are included the hurted weapons of the police stories and those stolen directly by the officers of the law compliance bodies.
Illegal weapons come to sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals, there were often explosions.
"There are versions demonstrated that some incendies have been caused premeditally to cover the deficiency," comments an exilitar.
See Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand grain.
"Now they have proliferated private weapons factories which are not disabled on the international market and distribute weapons under the black market, including Moscue," says the expert.
A more source of black market is the contraband.
A large number of weapons and ametrators come from poor countries such as Kirgisistan.
"There are accounting for their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been made that has organized the weapons flow," explains the former military.
Where's the weapons coming from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of illegal weapons for the black market.
A report on this issue was drawn up in 2011 by the Centre for Analysis and Planning of Public Management.
The specialists analysed reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, the bibliography and public access data of ports whose thematics turn to arms.
The majority of illegal weapons, as researchers, come from armed forces and security forces.
The half of the black market weapons has arrived there "from officers whose work is related to the weapons," it is said in the report.
Researchers, 17% of the weapons come from the places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the weapons production and 5% correspond to the " illegal archeology".
The dependent of one of the tents of weapons, who requested that his call was not mentioned, says that weapons found by illegal excavators haven't been buying anybody for a long ago because they're too old.
More often, he says, providers are guided to military storages when they need a game.
A ≥ of some holiday, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the valley.
"This carries the weapon to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two loaders," tells us
"But, of course, the police is both in all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan is to be fulfilled, they make evidence purchases to illegal weapons traders," adds the dealer.
"As in a luxe bottle"
The seller and the purchasers are trying to find a familiar person.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who proposed me to be on the "Begovaya" platform, where I would be a man who would lead me to a "shot" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the weapon, I just heard it."
Military commentary Viktor Baranets
"To get a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts," says the department of the tent. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust much in him."
There are sellers in the markets, but there is also to come, let's say "of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked him to say that a diet had fallen to his daughter."
I can even get a couple of stainless hands to a trusted person.
He also gives them to me only because he knows that I'm not going to delay him.
News are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of illegal weapons buyer in the middle of the 1990s when a article was available to be published on this subject.
The schemes, if their words are, haven't changed.
They gave you an album of photos where there was no "of all".
"I felt like in a lush bottle," replies the military.
To the purchaser, if they are words of Baranets, they don't offer a gate for free: all that is available can be proved.
I, as a potential client, not just buy; go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
"I give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure that the weapon is shooting well, we start negotiating," the procedure describes the expert.
Sofa Title
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where you are offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No personal documents or meetings are repeated for this.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the public warning "Buy a gun or a metrella."
There users make their requests and ask questions.
And sell older men?
"No permission, of course," ask the user "Ivan" (conserved spelling).
"Build a gun TT. Moscu," Lacsonically formulates its question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of ficticious websites and catching two hands to those who want to buy fire weapons.
And people go, like hungry fish to the cup, and then, to take carbon into Siberia
military commenter and exmilitar Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: Generally, the website is registered outside the reach of Russian laws.
People do the requests.
The purchaser makes the payment to a auto box.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden," reports the press secretary of the NGO "The right to the weapons," Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets that if a online request is made, one remains without gun and puts it in prison.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of ficticious websites and catching two hands to those who want to buy fire weapons.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the cup, and then, to take carbon into Siberia," he.
Makarov for $100
In purchasing illegal fire weapons, experts, one can be spent from $100 to $900.
See Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Weapons", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
A month and a half should be expected.
It is sent from military storages by medium rango heads.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced to 7%, which consists of 22.900, and the number of cases identified by stealing and extortion of weapons, munitions, explosives and explosive artacts decreased at 7.8%.
The employees of quick and supermarket restaurants in the United States are placed in the hall.
Even a fourth part of adolescents and youths find their first jobs as boxers in "McDonald's"
In the latest days, there has been started an oil of protests against low salaries paying on the supermarkets of Walmart corporation and in restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentyky Fried Chicken".
For now, no one attracts to survive whether or not this hole comes to the nine points, or if he has designed for strengths and is advanced in its first steps.
Protection actions are supported by the syndicates and a series of links NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest salaries perceived by Walmart workers and the quick food system, the objective of protest organisationers is the creation of workers' syndicates in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has not been occupied by the syndical movement.
Forty-six hundred per year?
The actions started last week, after the Day of Thanksgiving Action, the "Black Fridays". That day, in the United States, the greenhouse orgy that captured millions of residents, and sometimes was accompanied of employment.
That day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, who employed 2.2 million people worldwide, abandoned their jobs and formed protest pickets with the syndicates and left activists in corporation tents, whose products are guided to people of moderate and moderate income.
Walmart sells all of it, from bottles, jail rivers and batteries for cars, up to aspirants, eggs and milk.
Products in their tents are of average between 8% and 27% higher than those of the largest supermarkets.
That's why many unpaid workers of Walmart buy only in the work.
Well, it is important that Walmart has made one of the largest corporations in America.
See the words of two critics, Walmart can be allowed to sell very low price products, in part because they pay little to their workers.
These latters are also complained about bad work conditions, such as lack of handloads or hand scanners.
That Black Wednesday the participants of the manifestation increased the salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation had passed from $30 to $100 menes.
For a typical worker of Walmart, who receives $9.5 per hour, this expenditure is equivalent, they said.
Cents of the University of California in Berkeley argument that if Walmart increases the average salary up to $12 per hour, this will cost $3.2 billion.
This is approximately 1,1% more than it is spent in salaries now.
If Walmart places the salary increase in the consumers' backs, each visit to the tent will result only 46% more.
In one year, they will cost the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they are now.
Walmart's partyers comment satisfied that the protest had occurred only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss of corporation.
The Black Friday was extended in its tents from the 8th Thursday evening to the midnight of the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second.
In total, their recording boxes performed the "Black Fridays" nearly 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, stated at a interview at the left site of Huffington Post, who left their job "minder than five" employees in Walmart and that the protest was not more than "other trick of public relations", organized by the workers' syndicate.
"Free Cade!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not exactly the large storages of Walmart (which in this progressive city does not appreciate them, and therefore there is no one for now), but the "McDonald's" and other beautiful restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells thousands of millions of parts, and then don't give you the low for sickness and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York municipal Council
Currently, in accordance with the federal law and the New York law, the minimum payment is $7.25 per hour.
Quick food restaurants will increase it with time, but only easily, and averagely, workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one wins less than they in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it's something incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost the fourth part of the teenagers and adolescents passed through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the showers, partly after school, even though they lived with their parents.
There were few people who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I'm constantly throwing in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live from this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal, there is a comment that the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he doesn't know what to eat them.
The participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 on Thursday morning at McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, began to pay at least $15 per hour for boxes and quick food cookers, or to double their current minimum payment.
They also said that in the rapid food sector syndicates of workers were created.
The U.S. Law prohibits administration to prevent this right and punish actors of the syndical movement with arguments and discharges.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their life.
But for objective reasons it is easy that the syndicates cover the food sector.
One of the main ones is the severe rotation of the staff.
Discords
Ruidos protests occurred at the same day in other beautiful restaurants of Manhattan.
The curmination of the action occurred at half of the mythin in the McDonald's near Times Square, in which several local democratic politicians participated, especially the member of the Municipal Council of Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says he is selling thousands of millions of parts, and then neither if he gives you a hospital nor pays you for your honest work."
The manifestants received the support of other democrate delegates in New York, such as the candidate at the town of Bill de Blasio, who said, "We must support the workers in the quick food sector so that they can receive just salaries and economic prosperity that each new Yorkian deserves."
As the New York Times magazine described, this was the most manifestation of this type in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people were involved in it, even not all of them were employed in the quick food service, in which tens of thousands of people in New York worked.
It's not yet clear if this will serve as a chispa to cause a massive movement.
"For now, the injury of the brain doesn't result so easy."
The theme of the increased reality, so popular among modern technologies, is recently normally understood mainly to the prize of special wilds.
At the beginning of the summer, at his annual conference, Google showed a model in movement and later, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also submitted a request to claim the relevant patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in the Microsoft de Cambri. Izadi Sharamom, Izadi Sharamom, was diluted that for the scientists of that company, the birds already belonged to a past stage.
They are attractive to the perspective of the manipulation of objects in the air with the naked hands and the creation of open spaces.
- Please, in general, what is the subject of study of your research group?
- We dedicate ourselves to the interaction of person-ordinators, but we are also trying to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now, the humanity in its large mass has been arrested in the work stage with the pixels of the plane screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look at 5-10 years ahead and advise cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is selling without Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else is the future for us?
- Although Kinect has led the interaction to the physical level, most of this still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work in really tridimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design systems.
The world must be released from the informatics to our, physician, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that it surrounds.
Then we can complete the real world with more comfortable objects.
First of all, the devil with those stupid real real rocks!
- What are you thinking about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they're overwhelming it?
- Of course, it cannot be considered a pause, it is able to solve the question of privacy, because it does not always want others to understand our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each one in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not on slow movements, but on shorter.
Furthermore, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a powder that recorded the mouse of bones and muscles.
For now it's very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a pulser clock.
But in general, the future is for a combinated type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda side?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very difficult to recognize.
- You want to force users to adapt to what you can or can't do the machine at this time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in a future we will need to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can determine the reactions of the person.
These may, for example, be laser sensors, because they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect Sensors, what are you complaining about modern cameras?
Do you miss resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the present generation is what may be the beginning of our work with tridimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of matrix and depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not sufficiently good for us; this gives the designers of algorithms more work.
So we must remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes but also in Z.
The speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are pretty dynamic and the current 30 fps are really short, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, of our lust in Redmond, made a contact sensor with a suitable delay of 1 to 100 ms processing and it should be said that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects human-ma-interaction.
I would have been very useful for my job a equivalent of this device, but it would not re-contact so that the tables per second were more.
- And don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect has now three "camers", one of which is actually the infrared rays and the second the recipient of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the diaposone.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Possiblely, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of estimates.
It would be good to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the location curvature of cameras and see how this would help determine the tridimensional position.
- That's why I remember, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, hasn't presented your birds to the public.
Doesn't it seem that, from the view of the daily use of actually increased technologies, the birds are one of the most platforms?
- Of course, passing all mouse by holding up a smart phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could pass from the walls to the smart phone,
The walls are very personal devices, in that you have your strength (the private things only you can see), but also their deficiency: a increased reality based on walls will not allow you to work on objects together with others.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of holographic objects in the air is not only available for Tony Stark from the "Iron Man" movie but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics suggest: there is no tactical answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers will your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my conferences, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh irruption in interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be the tactical feelings.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting trucks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Register the tact perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are actually oriented to provide tangibleness to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is given a similar feeling that one feels if someone was soft in the fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also pulsers for the munich that affect the nervous finances of the fingers, this also promises a direction.
- Did you try to mislead the brain?
Do you make him think he feels what he seems to feel at the time he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't done it yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically where it is in a very reduced space thinks that he goes to an open space, almost unfinished. We are also working on the idea of running boxes (not as the gimnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as the gigantic globes.
For now, it doesn't result so easily, it's still to work for many years.
That is what makes the work attractive with the reality of researchers, which many things are located in a state of total conception.
Subject personal pleasure instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of San Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are in front, to the guardian of art and culture.
In this list of the best figures of the art and the scene of San Petersburg are found, whose achievements come beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without that Russia knows them if it does.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirrill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a barbudd man dressed up-to-door red man, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Soul Garden or at mode and injury meetings.
Kirill Miller's tables always attach to ́s, where they want to be shown.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociofilosophers in San Petersburg, creators of new mitology.
Kirill Miller is a representative of the Vanguardism of San Petersburg at the end of the 80s of the 90s.
Moreover, he is a city man, whose appearance in the streets of the city wake up in the smileless inhabitants and rise up all the state of encouragement.
Recently, he took in his hands a organile and became the organiker of San Petersburg, because he was mature to make such a difficult role, because of his existence of bohemia, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going through the red town, not from yellow or Turkish, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a mode designer and I'm dedicated to the appearance and image.
In this world, red color is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little grass produces aggressiveness and agitation of good properties.
But my provocations are addressed to start a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
- What do you understand you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition of the Nevsky Culture Palace, where my jobs were shown.
I realized that it was my way.
Then the oil of old non-official artists had finished, and the new, free like me, were still incomplete.
I became a friend of artists of the new hole, with the following to those exposed to Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new hole has already been completed.
I got on the theater by the clothes, the music of all kinds, but not by letters.
And all this was joined to your art clinic... - I was important to find me in the cultural centre of San Petersburg, where the best creative minds should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of San Petersburg's bohemia.
Many were born there: Names, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sing light songs under fonogramme, clothing fitted garments, among them it was currently as moda Igor Vdovin.
When the group eats to play alive, it became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before Hali-Galivski's time.
We gave them Trachtenberg and was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
"D 137", the Griboyedov Club, are the rest of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and assistance customers.
I'm a hero of the past centuries, when culture was meaning something.
In 2000, the survey was made in the press, the premium was "The people of our city".
In the name "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so it ended my culmination.
In these new times, it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who loves the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our time, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very little worshipped.
- There's something recognible in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, and there is clearly expressed the present and occurrence.
I'm going to make a programmed exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Palace".
Payments are a climate category.
I was so social, but now being so painful and terrifying.
But in the payers everything is embarrassed and the tragedy is removed.
I love the big, I have big ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a total and mandatory change of clothing.
Now one follows by the clothes, orients in the outside, but not inside the person.
And maybe that person doesn't owe or give his hands, but take it in his face.
And deceiving will be removed when it changes of clothes.
We've seen you in the town organic role along.
Which better than me to be!
- All right, but can the best business art be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, having tact.
We are being witnesses of the desintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped in manadas, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simples other.
Now all have been divided into microcommunities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a 100-dollar ticket to like everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want.
Now, every worship hero has his 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov come for thousands!
- They're going to see him abandoned, there the sex-social area works.
And to a cultural event there are 300 people, 10 thousand will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is marked.
I've got my fans, it's the most important thing to don't mislead them, not to throw out what you got.
When he was young, he made the tables that a collector had taken them on the wall near Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people generally end.
Now they often confund concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in consumption, it's another story.
I am a man from the culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, they refused money only to pin tables.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: Cultural officer.
But not all of them can dedicate themselves to culture.
When the kings were the rights, everything was otherwise, the kings might not understand very well the culture, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow, there are very good consultants now.
We have people in San Petersburg that could be experts, but they are closed because they need experts at a higher level that evaluate them correctly and open their way.
Now it's prospering the subjective personal pleasure.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to search for other museums.
- What's for you San Petersburg?
- San Petersburg is not a cultural capital. There is much more culture in Moscow, there is a terrain.
But on our stones it's hard to grow art.
We need cultural area and now we have more writers than readers, this is bad.
In Europe there are many interesting people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is infime.
We have to make the art being mode, as it was at the beginning of the past century.
The project will be implemented with a subvention of San Petersburg.
Give birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global heating or shock with a murderous asteroid.
Space vessels with humans on board are in search for a repository planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is made: How can the species continue in conditions of ingravity or in the same repository planet?
I think there's nowhere to choose.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized at least hypoteticly.
"These are Venus and March," says the Chief Research of the State Astronomical Institute, Starberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in March are better for life, in Venus' surface temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at big heights or in Venus' orbit... in the space.
It is eaten to cope with the problems of reproduction in the space with the flower.
A half centuries ago, experiments with plants have been carried out.
Four generations of orbitally cultivated guests were not distinguished in any of the earthly varieties.
Then I saw the crew of insects in the orbite, small muscles of the fruit, the drosophiles.
In 1979, eggs were sent to the codorniz space to check how embryo is developed in ingravity conditions.
We get a normal pollution as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this pollution has to find support, it must keep on its own feet and begin moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Biomedicic Institute (IPBM) of the Russian Science A.
When they did not find support, the pollutants gave the backs at azar.
And after 10 hours in recent birth, a total atrophy of the instincts was given.
The pollutants did not react to the light or sound.
And unfortunately, after four days, they just died.
"And two times we got to be born the pollutants, but then we left it because it was impossible to work with them," comments Vladimir Sychev on the failure of experiment with pollutants in the space.
The last time a biological "miniarca" flighted to the orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue at the early 2013.
However, in the "Bion" biosatellite they will only travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with mouse, which were sent to space already with fats.
In the beginning, nothing overnatural was found.
"This was exactly in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space walls had a seed.
However, it has not yet been able to address the problem of reproduction directly in the space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, in their habitual habit, can simply not perform their sexual instinct.
The man, however, contrary to the small animals, in the beginning, can.
The Homo ́ens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a suitable emotional fund.
Similar experiences are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have traveled to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most humanity has is the female body.
Our gaviot flys, and no one on Earth could say: if it's after a flight to space.
You may or not have a baby after this flight.
"Therefore, no one has answered this question," comments the Vakhtang Vachnadze spatial sector veteran.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight to space, the first cosmonauta woman, Valentina Tereshkova, was born to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonauta.
In 1988, the second cosmonauta woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was two times in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, you've persevered the risk.
We are few, the astronautes are counted to who after long flights all have resulted well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," resumes the Cosmonauta pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity should seek some new ways in biotechnology, radiological protection, in the creation of artificial severity.
The work of the Cosmonate Preparation Centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation for the flight.
In the conditions of nul floatability, cosmonautes practice their ability to work in the space.
The water simulates ingredience.
If for a adult the water is a comfortable environment, even though still enemy, for a recently born child is its birth element.
Small-anfibio men seem to confirm that life in the earth has come from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is located about 9 months within his mother in the amniotic liquid, because it will be easier to be used after water.
In the beginning, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the first bathroom only 2 weeks pass.
"This is very little to view something," says Marina Aksenova, a monitor of natation of recently born.
In summary, if ingredience is a more natural state for a newborn, women need gravity, the strength of severity.
In the inflammation, abdominal muscles and pelves are very fast decrepted, the fat exhaust capacity is reduced.
Well, let's forget that, trusting the action of stimulants for birth.
Of course, you can be born in a special camera, this will push it.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov is making this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial severity.
Without the feeling of severity, the body does not generate the skeletal or the muscle system.
A recently born in orbita is impossible to clothe him with a special training for training, such as adults.
It'll simply privacy you about what is vital for him.
"And this experience that we will do together, allowing a child to be born in a foreign environment, will bring us to the Earth to a fully inappropriate person," says the leader of the Bioetics Committee of the Biomedicical Problems Institute of the Russian Sciences A.G. Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in the space is a theoretical issue.
However, with time this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships go to a remote planet that will be the home for their children born in the space.
Chief of the NKU: The inspection of the "svarc" system has not been given with the guilty policy
In the field of public adjudications, the Republic of Czech accounts for good inspectors and a quality legislation, although its application is covered.
This is Miloslav Kala, president of the Suprema Control Office (NKU) in an interview for Actually.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we miss," so describes the current situation.
Joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of a wrong practice, Peter Netime refers to the system of autonomousness only on the paper, which is known as the "svarc".
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not molestrate businessers with inspectors.
"The law must be regulated in any way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the President of the Government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls nor to commit obligations," Kala states.
In the Committee on Control at the Conference of Members, you discussed the common project between the Czech team and the German, in the context of which the legislation on public adjudications was compared.
What is exactly?
It's a parallel control we've started to carry out about two years ago.
It is simplified: European legislation regulates how public adjudications should be organized, and this follows the existing legislation in each country and then practices in itself.
We have joined everything and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences; usually, our country's legislation is "restricter and more complete", however, the practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate more strict rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law.
What can it actually contribute to this project? What do you think these are the conclusions?
Exactly a common control of this type could help us to stop investing efforts in the concretion of laws, reduction and improvement of limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of the economy means to achieve adequate thing to a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid riches and, at the long time, criminal action.
But not because of reducing the limit of adjudications, it means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is satured with so much "paper", that those who want to look for mistakes in the system can make it easier than if the limits remained as high as now.
You are talking about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public adjudications.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it a Office like our NKU or is it organized in another way?
As much as the offices, such as the NKU, there acts the Bundesehof (Federal Court of Auditors), with a similar organization to our, with a college also, it is the only thing that in its case it is so different, but in principle both offices evolute parallelly.
However, as Germany has a federal organization, the accounting courts are even at this level.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call State funds here.
The public funds, managed by the regions and municipalities, are there in Germany controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As regards local legislation, is it more simple than our?
In general, I would not like to set a comparison without specific data, but Germany is still a model in some aspects, but it cannot be precisely precise in what it is better.
Could it be better, for example, as regards the quality of inspectors?
I'm sure not, but I repeat, I don't like to do this kind of comparison.
It is necessary to say that even those countries we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it wasn't so, you wouldn't have any benefit to cooperate with our office, don't you think?
As regards the legislation of our country, what did the amendment to law on public adjudications mean for its Office?
Taking into account that the period of validity of this amendment is short, it has not yet been shown in control actions.
Since we perform ex post controls, we need to count with a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparation of future controls: we have started a new tool for "no-economic risk detection", which we have passed nearly 14.000 public adjudications, which have been analysed. Changes will be completely reflected here, since the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of selection process and similar are corrected.
Do you think that the approval of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it is a broadcast for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is probably a step in the right direction and I hope that it is.
The problem that may occur is that the legislation "stains" and is impossible to comply with it.
Before the previous legislation, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and each unrespected law on public adjudications was the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it mean then to endure the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or use it and not punish those who commit a formal failure, who are not able to make decisions.
A system of this type will only be able to create a greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how's it getting out of this?
We'll see where this way leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently declared that the ODS would not molestrate businessers with controls of the named Swarc system, with regard to the fact that it was autonomous only on the paper. What does this mean?
Is the Swarc system allowed or allowed?
The law should be regulated in any way, and, if it prohibits something, neither if the Government Prime Minister can prevent the action of the Office, which has the obligation to carry out such controls and obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and let it be," but you can't say we're doing anything.
In the law on public adjudications, the legislation is quite strict about how to act formally, and this is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer because it does not meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we miss.
The roads present ice plates, although most of them are transitable
In several places of the Czech Republic, the roads present ice and snow plates.
Although most of the roads are transible, in some, precaution should be exhausted.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today the morning the roads in Karlovy Vary region were transible, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature descends and will weigh between five and ten degrees below zero. The day will easily ascend the termometres.
He has stopped snow in the region and in the low areas the snow is fine.
Instead, in the crossing of the Metal Mounts, the snow reaches nearly 30 centimeters.
In some places the visibility was still bad because of the snow, information from the control centre of operations of the roads of the region.
Quick R6 and first category road in the region are now transible without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to extinguish precaution, especially in some pools whose surface can be iron and rebaldized.
Moreover, all roads of second and third category, including mountain roads, are also transible.
Nevertheless, there are still trames with ice residues and snow.
It is necessary to increase attention on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some roads of East Bohemia, there is a danger of iron and higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer could have been made on the roads, reporting on its pages the Road and Road Direction.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger of ice plates, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
In the middle of Lanškrouna, Usti nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Highokego Myta, and especially on the roads of second and third category.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There are snow especially on the roads of the Mounts of Krkonosche to Orlische Hory.
There is a snow layer in the highest areas of the streets in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Knie και Trutnov.
In the area of the East Bohemia, the heaven will be today between clear and partly clouded, without precision.
The temperatures will usually cross between three below zero and a positive degree, a weaker wind will be soft.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transible today in the morning, although the precaution must be exhausted and need to be adapted at the time.
In the first hours of the morning there will be iron, temperatures will be darkened between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the latest decrease of the temperatures, some ways may also be ice ornaments.
In some places the drivers will be found with noble, but visibility will improve progressively.
This is what is drawn out from the information of the Centre of Road Operations of the Region.
Autopista D5 is almost transible without restrictions, although it is recommended to extinguish caution, especially in the way between 80 and 13m
The surface of most of the first category roads is dry and without ice.
In the street area of Pilsen and Tachov border with Germany, there may have traces with ice places.
The second and third category routes are humid, so, in this case, it is also warned of trames with ice plates.
The drivers should be more abilities, especially on the less transited routes in the Shumava area.
Olomo Region
The drivers leading to the highest areas of the Olomo region will be met with partly waste snow.
After chemical treatment, there remained still snow at the door of Chervenohorské and on the road towards Videlský cross.
The road operators removed the snow during the night; in the street of Shumper, some three centimeters of snow were collected, and the road administrators were collected.
In the rest of the region, most of the ways are transible without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the street of Shumper, remaining snow.
The drivers at the Port of Chervenohorské will be met with a middle-sneak snow in the direction of Jesenic," has confirmed today a Officer of the Straight-Administration of Shumper to the TCK.
On the ground and night, their colleagues also arrived to Jesenicka and, after chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now cleaned and mixed.
On the Olomo road, the roads are transible without restrictions, in Sternberská the drivers should carry carefully in forest trames, where the roads are still humid.
Region of Usti nad Labem and Liberec
Operators of North Bohemia's roads have informed about complications in different ways at the first hour of the morning.
Besides some places where you have snowed or ironed, the police database is closed between Telnice and Knínice in the Usti nad Labem region.
The temperatures remain under zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow are obviously in the calcium. In the lowest areas, especially in the south-east of the Czech central mass, there are no problems and the roads, usually, are dry.
No service complications have been registered by the opinion.
Road operators have warned about ice presence in the surroundings of Sztětí.
If you are the horologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. Day is waiting for rain and snow that is sprinkled and by night the heaven will be cleaned and there will be ice.
From the general roads, unfair conditions have been announced in the street I/13, in the border between the Usti na Labem and Liberec region.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had arked on the way with the weight of the snow.
Simmon Ornest: In our concerts we want to buy positive energy
It's said that in a few less than a month it's gonna come to the end of the world, what does he think about it?
It's just one of the other alarming news that we like to catch us.
Music group The Tap Tap we like better to broke about this and we like to say that we are the only group of music in the world that can assemble enough positive energy to put the end of the world or avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a real original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
It is a stately benefit that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential that has the end of the Maya calendar announced for 21 December at 11:10 of the morning.
On the previous day, on 20 December to 21 hours, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost at the same time when the Maya calendar ends on the Kiribati Island in the Ocean, 12 hours before our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to?
Initially, it was my idea, then we flew the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
Besides wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state where we will leave the world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we also created a single collection of articles: bottles, bags, bottles and original bottles against the end of the world that can be purchased on www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, together with other interpreters, also sang the called himno against the end of the world, which leads by title "The End of the World, cancelled".
It is currently very popular in YouTube, can you hear in the benefits concerts?
Of course, yes, and it'll be just the last, well, when everything goes well and the world's not finished...
All interpreters will sing it at the same time in the three concerts.
The himons will be linked simultaneously thanks to the special transmission directly in the Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák wrote the letter of this song and interpreted the protagonist role of Jesus in the videoclip, where Xindl X also sang...
How did this cooperation come up?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech culture scene, except organizing many benefits and concerts...
We have all our efforts to participate in this project.
It has been demonstrated that most of them are interested and diverted to work with us.
What will the money recovered in concerts against the end of the world?
The equipment for the Education Centre Without Studeo barriers, which we end in its sixth year consequently with the civil Tap association in Jedličkovov constitute.
Students of the Jedlikkovv School are regularly visiting teachers with whose entertainment are fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient economic means to pay the teachers, and we make an effort to make it possible.
In the context of the end of works in Jedličkovv constituted, there will be an independent building which we will follow with this project.
In each concert there are several groups and interpreters.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop an attractive programme for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will act Chinaski, Lesbiens Support, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
To get more details, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Have you planned any other "specacular" action similar in the future?
In May, we will act for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so we will certainly prepare a attractive program with interesting guests.
The year that comes would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall of New York and me, personally, using that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with actions in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans in the foreign are not exactly minimalists, yet you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by persons with disabilities.
How is logistic and organization of these travels?
It's not so hard as it can look first.
There are five members in the rubbers, the chairs must travel in the equipment and we also weigh a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, until now we have arranged them well. The CSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not stop surprising me.
Even in Moscow, where we've been back for a while, everything went out without problems.
Thanks to the outcome to the foreign, you can compare the different societies to disabilities and other aspects.
What have you found up to now?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have been witnesses that, in the east, there is a lot of way to run.
In contrast with Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there still without frequency that a person moves alone through the center of the city in a road-site of the roads.
Something so running as it is, for example, giving a preferential to someone in a wheel of races in a rise, there it isn't.
Fortunately, a civil association has been created to discuss the problems of people with incapacity.
In what ways should we take examples of developed countries?
There are many aspects in which we're going back...
However, it is important to note that perfection and improvement of the situation always depend on those who are directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal that people with a serious disabilities are moved through their public account and can go to the service, to the museum, where you want...
But it is not very common that a large number of people with incapacity participate in the social life actively, in this regard, with The Tap Tap Let's go a little ahead!
A respectable or without barriers society is one thing, but when the time comes to come, in which sports, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will begin to change everything true.
Until now, there are isolated cases of people who have a great willing force.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look at a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as a educator in Jedlikkowov's establishment, where many young people around me wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I'm a musician, I'm playing, among other things, the saxofon, I found an amateur group with a companion of work.
And with time, as our moderator Ladja Angelovič says, it was a little of our hands (Laughter).
However, popularity hasn't arrived until these last years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it has helped us very much to connect with famous songs and to work actively to promote the group.
We have concluded that the work that is not seen is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the aid of the European Union, we can also allow quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Do you want to get so far with The Tap Tap?
Since the beginning, I saw the potential that there was, that can be done something differently.
The world of the spectacle is filled with things that seem to each other.
It's logical, in its way, all the news takes carefully and takes long time to accept it.
There's a few extraordinary things, but I'm trying to say that the Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with incapacity are not abandoned that suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop with it, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well to people with incapacity, then it is not just a progress for them, but for the whole society.
Did you help the fact that you are a needed boss, as many people describe him?
If we want to do a quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and have a certain discipline.
I think it's totally normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to come two days to test, go to the preparation test and spending a long time traveling and in concerts, the initial eufory leaves them quickly.
But this is how it works everywhere, in each group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group now has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Ladda Angelovič.
We're a open group, people come and go, they can't be avoided.
Whoever wants and wins will always find open doors
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
There will be 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic
The three towns will be connected at the end of the video conference sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, cancelled"
The goal of the concert is to gather the resources necessary to finance the multifunctional equipment of the educational center without STUDEO barriers in Jedlikkowov constitute of Prague, which costs 25 million Czech crowns.
The entry to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years of age have free entry into the previous sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
In the Ministers of the European Space Agency's countries last week, Poland was accepted as a twoth member of the ESA. It is the second Member State of the ESA of the former East European block, after the Czech Republic, who became a member of the full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in the Agency ' s project committee during the years later.
However, the Path of Poland to the cosmos empe’ much before.
Polish enthusiasts were already dedicated to flights to space before the Second World War, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the Conference of A. Šternfeld at the astronomical observatory of Varsovia in which, on 6 December 1933, she presented its ideas on the Pionear Study "Introduction to Cosmonautic".
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left indifferent assistants and, years later, Sternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski was the only person who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld received the premium Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for their "Introduction to Cosmonautic".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great impulsor of astronomy and cosmonautic.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientist discipline.
Gadomski became a promotor of the cosmonautic, he was known worldwide and his contribution to science was resumed when his name was placed to one of the hidden faces of the moon.
In 1925, a dress was built in Poland that would be provided by a cocktail engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the project's comments are also not known.
It is not clear whether the coffee was to be used for the start of the dress or for its brain.
The information on this tissue is limited to the collection in the pressure of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery begins to dedicate himself to the missiles.
The research was financed by the Techniki Cell Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Miečislawem Wolfkem and Professor Gustavem Mokrrzyckiegim.
From the conservated material, it is evident that the investigation has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937, in the specialized press, the prototype of a photo-electric chasing missile designed by the Rohoziński engineer and the next year was published the study "Rakieta - poor torpeda and raketobomba aeroplane", of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Sciently Adviser Committee (Timzeitary Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects of missile technology for military use and coordinated all works.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of war.
Other cosmonautic studies appeared in the Polish press after war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautic Society.
In November 1954 of the magazine Problemy is first referring to the society with four very astronautical articles.
In one of them, of Professor Subotowicze, the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautic.
At that time, projects of artificial satellite were already implemented and was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future perspectives.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) encouraged to be a part of the International Astronautic Federation (based in 1951) and in the same year the PTA became full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kaziméd Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He performed this duty until he died in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM sonda cocket (Meteorological Rakieta), which was a success and became the first Poland cohete in which the citizen research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on 10 October 1958.
The cohete had an apogeo of 1.800 meters, approximately 80 cm length and did not reach the 5 kg weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 were launched the air tests of the RM-2 cockets of two steps in the wilderness of Buldov.
The cohete was 1,4 meters and weighted about 11,5 kg.
Another type of developing cohete was to be subject to real science study. The RM-34 cohete would have a 14.5 km pooge and its mission would be to control the wind of the height.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM cockets was the meteor-1 cocket, which was built during the 1962s and 1965s.
It was designed as two stages cocket, with a total length of 510 cm and a initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which were differentiated from the space available for scientist devices.
The space available for volume was 0.4 litres, 0.34 litres meteo-1B and 0.62 litres Meteor-1C.
The maximum apogeo in the three types was 37 km.
During the years 1965 to 1968, the meteor-2 cohete was developed in the Air Institute, whose first air tests were started in October 1970.
The meteor-2 cohete had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a profitable weight of 10 kg to 60 km height.
Later the version of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 was built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the training of the CoSPAR National Committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the research of the Space on Soviet artific satellites and, in 1978, the Poland pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaute after Vladimir
The suspension of the social work law is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Judge suspended social work law.
The resolution was awakened by an accurate discussion in society.
Thereafter, it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and less legislative competition.
Thus, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in constant conflict.
The cause is found in the principle of free trade and free and unlimited private capital movement, together with the unexpected financial speculation.
The impact of large differences on work costs (of salaries) results in economic pressures.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of nice goods, cut off distances and for this purpose "a lower" of the competitor's price with the aim of making it with most of the market and thus increase its margin of benefits.
A large scale means, for most employees, transfering the production to the foreign, buying the more beautiful or well disappearing there. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of work is higher than other economics.
Since the private capital has no social responsibility and therefore is not also responsible for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, it is necessary to increase the social expenditure of the state.
All of this situation promotes the total disinterest of businesses by paying taxes and compensating the economic and social damage they have caused to gain benefits.
The situation is universally so known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
The low-sufficient practices of the private capital create, in certain economys, in which the governments of those countries are committed to competition with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and thus attaching foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments put private capital to their own population without taking into account social decline.
This is particularly clear in the changes of existing laws.
The objective is to oblige the population to accept the statement of the private capital, especially in respect of the salaries.
This is, on the one hand, through the economic obligations system in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, by the restricted right of employees in relation to work rights.
The result is a growing poverty together with the increase in the differences between poor and rich.
Since a number of years ago, there are food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid has already reached a million.
In the context of the increase in German economy, there is a very common case: people employed with such a lower salary that the state should pay the rest to reach the minimum insufficient to survive.
A scandal of this type was made public with the situation of the helpers of the German Federal Parliament.
The measures for adequately all the states of the south of the EU are, without doubt, leading to the same situation; people, pressed by an abissmal decline of their social level, are committed to immigration as in the 19th century or to immigration with a worst salary in the limit of society, with the hope that the private capital investor country comes on a day.
Do you need to ask you where he comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, poverty goes from one country to another or never comes, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilians, Turkish, Marokko, Egyptians or Africans are still working for an infinite part of a European salary.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and communications means to the diversity that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, which leads to the economy's failure.
The private capital defends the state that the state should not intervene in the economy by entering control.
Thereafter, it is necessary to ask whether the private capital does not affect its selfishness in the political course and, then, throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly effective.
The test is the existence of lobbys, in very powerful and universal practice, in all states.
The result is an unexpected situation that is shown in the field of corruption, in mutual favors, in a legislation that is practically reprobable in all places but is not penalable.
The situation in Germany is the following: State ministers, without financial means, are responsible for the editing of law projects to private legal companies, which are often linked to the industry.
This type of law projects are adopted later in the Bundestag, the German Parliament.
In this way, all powers are not from the people, as it is announced in the constitutions of the Western Democracy, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracy with a liberal orientation is quickly found in a situation in which Appianos described in their work The crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeya: "The state took time to disintegrate and the administrations were occupied with force."
In turn, the benefits obtained illegally and helped to finance rocks or spades.
The sovereignty and corruption were extended without prejudice, and the people came to the urnes with the vow of before-hand"... "There were no people with a character to aspire to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consules"... "The only medicine for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a powerful man"... While Appianos thought in Pompeya, César went up to power and transformed democracy forever in selfcrace.
The conclusion is that the current society is based on unconsidered preferences of individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
The private capital is not able, in its essence, to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as that of then, an elite's responsibility without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the growth of fascist and communist regimes should therefore be seeked in the disfellowshipped liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
With regard to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy, as a determined pause, in the expectation of the next struggle.
The fact that the current elite is totally ignoring the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters of which we have been witnesses, as well as crimes against mankind, as we know them in the old history and the most recent.
The suspension of the law on public adjudications is not the solution; at least not long-term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue seeking other ways to reduce the population's social level.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which encourage both the participation of the state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and debilitate the position of the private capital monopolie in the society in the benefit of the state.
Israel: the chaos.
"That doesn't come from violence and nothing ever could" (Not survive anything of violence and nothing could do it), Sting in his Fragile song and whose stiffle reveals "Let's don't forget how fragile we are" (we don't meet the fragile we are).
"If my children didn't want wars, there would be no" Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his death bed in 1849.
After the last oil of violence between Israel and the Gaza franja, different reactions have occurred, as always.
One, from Israel, arguments for the right to self-defence and emphasize the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, the other supports the Palestinians and appeals to racism by Israel's state, genocide against the Palestinian Arabs and the Israel of terrorism.
I don't want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are periodically repeated and who is the victim, and at the end, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territory, were born in the current political situation and did not live the beginning of violence.
My intention is to offer the readers a look behind the telone, a look to discover who benefits from the tensions that have been dragged since 95 years (calculated from the Balfour statement in November 1917) in a small surface of Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, other in conclusions that I have reached on the basis of my own way to understand the matter, on who or what group of people is the main impulsor of modern history's advancements.
In the history of mankind, the history of fighting for power is in the first row.
At every time we can find a Great Alejandro or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so clear is if these characters were always those who led their steps autonomously or if behind his throne there was someone who guided their actions to a certain goal.
We accept that we live in a time that concentrates the world's wealth in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and power that this involves, it has not been able to reach one generation.
From these astronomically rich families, one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I'm not rejecting it): the Rothschild.
It isn't written much near them.
Of course.
In the 90s of the 19th century, they bought the first news agency (Realings) to stop associating their name with criminal acts of great seriousness. Power and wealth, or both, cover their backs, which always signed for them a strengthening.
They have important participations in almost all the central world and in those countries where they are not represented, stated or prepared a war: before the attack to Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after Iraq's attack, 5, they were only four, but Russia has subjected the central government to the Russian government.
Everyone who has opposed this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of America of the Rothschild, empe′ during the Secesion War, and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
JFK eated to print money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was murdered in 1963; the congressist Louis McFadden was in 1936 revengeed after he wanted to ask the FED for having deceived the great economic crisis of 1929.
His affair by the world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, decorated by degree 33.
The first war was marked as a goal to eliminate the large monarch states throughout Europe; the second wanted to remove the colonial surface, especially from Great Britain, and the third was proposed to reduce the population of the earth between a half million and a billion people (like a number of slaves for their welfare and lush would be enough and would not consume so much resources), as well as the creation of a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than a project for such solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamic of the crisis discontinuation and the later offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from the chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong, and they always have a deterioration of the situation. If not, let us remember that the FED was created so that a crisis is not repeated as the year 1907.
So after the success of the inheritance murder at the australian-Hungary throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo, and after the first World War, they destroyed Zarist Russia with the beginning of the Bulgarian revolution.
The First World War was suddenly and unjustified from the military and economic point, the capital of Germany (the wars to end the Zarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the later disappointment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austrian Hungarian empire.
To prepare the Territory of the Second World War, bankers and politicians allowed to create, in such way, a conflicting situation based on the huge war reparations imposed on Germany, making optimal conditions for radicalization of poor masses. Later, it was enough to serve the Germans the solution of Führer, which was sufficiently strong and simple and indicated to guilty, and then building a Checoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that had to represent and represent the function of the fifth column, which took the call and caused the stream of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild impulsed the foundation of the sionist movement, a branch that encouraged the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned earlier seated the bases for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks in both parts.
It was the Second World War: It is difficult to know whether Hitler took too much from the arrow to which international bankers had taken it in a principle or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration fields created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, in the same way, war reparations imposed to Germany extended the way to the Second World War, with the announcement of the state of Israel, the focus was created for a third war.
If international bankers could start it, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War II, would become a victim to the first line of fight, now together with the Arab population or, generally, Muslim of the Middle East.
Israel is a huge, soldier and chaos machine, not only in the framework of his country but also at international scale.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israel conflict? Where is injustice generating injustice in an infinite spirit of violence, if at the beginning the codicium of some individuals and their affairs for the world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their mandaters, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist politics, loyal to international bankers, which makes everything possible to declare war to Iran, and considering Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (Chine, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we notice that Iran controls the stream of Ormuz, through which 20% of the world oil (the navigation course has only two miles width), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light is now shown the words David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in your imagination is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a bunch of people who are part of the well-approved financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new person is introduced a chip when he is born that controls all his being.
"And obligate all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark in the hand or in front of them, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bring the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand: who has two fingers in front, who summarizes the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six."
Argo movie: If you make it cruel, call me to Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of islamist students presented the American ambassador in Teheran and took 52 diplomates as rehens.
His freedom was to be changed by shah Mohamed Reza Pahlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, the country that had patrocinated its regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive perspective: to draw shah through the border, it could not be allowed, because, if it did, it would be dangerous to trust their aliens in other countries.
But the freedom of rehens in Iran, where the revolution had been disemployed in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not at its disposal.
It was a struggle to the prestigiation of the United States, which later intensified more with the failure to free the rehens from force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Government of Algeria.
In the United States, its destination caused a silent and animated oil against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's damage against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The "Argo" film of the director and actor Ben Affleck issues an episode of this story, which produced a small success for America.
No longer before the ambassador was occupied, six employees fled from the building.
After a complicated periple, they ended in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
○ In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, he was able to remove them from Iran, for that a story helped an extravagant point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the cinematographic team that examined the location in the country for the surrounding of a superproduction of science fiction.
Genre Combination
The plan that the expert brings to "exfiltration" Toni Mendez would require Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to make the lie true, it was written on the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, ficticial production society had even a real expense.
The details about the operation were held secretly for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
The Affleck movie is a unique combination of various types.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other hand, a named "caper movie", the story of an episode that went out well, a misleading (one example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The movie combines encouragement states. We found a well-documentated sequence of Teheran. In the sequence of credits shows emblog graphics of the time of the events, which were placed in the movie, and there are no many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, Hollywood's typical scenes are a lot more liviane, marked by ironia and a light exageration.
Furthermore, scenes of the central of the ≥ and other institutions: men brought to analyze the situation in the negotiations table, in the Office's passports, by phone...
Ben Affleck has been able to restart his career in a fine way.
The actor, who had been objected to burles, has become a respectable director and his way of action has stopped to be the white of ironic comments.
Argo is its third width, after "Small Adios, Bye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Ladrones" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film of Affleck in which the action doesn't take place in the city of Boston, where it was created.
Furthermore, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic of old film directors above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Teheran is "rood" in Canada.
The best film scenes are located in the streets, in the rebuilding of the true aspirations. The introductory sequence of the ambassador is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, translates the emotion of the disagreement and the lack of prediction that occurs when the history gives a step forward.
Affleck and its collaborators have a similar effect on the ficticious scenes (the impostor team on the Teheran base).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a explained story did not offer much in the sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here isn't all so elegant (the scene in which the crisis is in the Teheran port, the deviation of a call to America and the discovered search after its track becomes a crazy).
Argo's flashes are the discontrol that comes from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very fun role as Hollywood partners, although their characters deserved more space and are not much less, the only in this movie.
For these reasons, Affleck's movie loses a little dramatic trace, but it is a movie that can be followed with a moderate interest, appreciate its performance and the back style of a thriller that evolves in the 70s.
But that's gonna be hard.
As an exhibition of a real story and as a proof of the exhaustion that can be the ideas of all presentation and all science of secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for inflation of globs, bananas and cycles
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year provides an investigation on the most absurd rates, has now decided to announce the concurrence on "the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the EU board".
"The EU has planned to approve a 40 percent of women in headquarters in the large European companies," said Pravo Patrik Nader, the enquiry organizer.
Among the appointed absurdities, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women were advanced from better prices in life insurance because they objectly represent a smaller risk.
"And other incredible ideas of the EU's taller can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nader informed.
Among the EU's conflicted regulations, for example, is the obligatory age of biocomponents to fuel that, as a result, harms the environment; otherwise it is the use of mercury termometres in the whole life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline shades the size of the bullets, which has contributed to a significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
It has been criticized by the factic use of the expression "untar mantequilla" or the recovery of the classic trade bomb.
A quality plate must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union device often takes such decisions under the pressure of one or other market or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by any state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with veto threat, requires the needs of its own).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher quality planets should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "anormal curvatures".
The European Commission was defensed, saying that with this only seeks to harmonize the national standards which are not mentioned until the date, which simply complicated their marketing.
The standards referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been highlighted on the basis of the existing Directive's disruption of foodstuffs.
The candidate to win the investigation could be the EU's prescription last year, where in the inflable globes that are marketed is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years are not allowed to blame them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU was here referring to an American study, which, when talking about players, globs are the main cause of infant death for asfixion.
It is also a similar restriction to the use of macagoes by children of up to 14 years.
Interesting events are even born in our country
It is also absurd that the regulation relates to European officers: any official function in the EU cannot use the name of the European Union. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, it should be spoken of FYROM (Former Yugoslavia of”.
The Banko-poplatky.com server, in collaboration with liberal economy partnership Laissez Faire, appointed in the investigation, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food provisions in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum amounts of food provisions that can be located in the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
Then the Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the amount set for arrows in conserve, which caused him a substantive threat to debt.
The inquiry organisations also interested the event of paying to those countries who do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subvention for the application of subventions.
This type of ideas did not come in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're disappointed because we have no sea.
We are requesting the European Union a compensation," the Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSSD) said in August 2004.
It argued that in our country there was a lot of cereal and, as a result of the called intervention purchases, the state had full stocks and must be exported.
It is Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from the seaports, that the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organized a public conviction for the purchase of cereals of countries that have no access to the sea.
The subvention to receiving a subvention was proposed to municipalities by the Minister for Local Development, addressed by Minister Paul Nemec (US-DEU), particularly for the editing of applications for subventions in Brussels.
EU: Rare requirements are appeal
Member States' directs are often white of criticism, the EU's efforts on regulations and also a more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserves better, many experts, our recognition.
The most serious problem is, for example, the covering of EU subventions for projects that have nothing to do with the depth of European integration, but that Member States have achieved in budget negotiations.
The Czechs also touch the sensitive fibre, like other Union countries, the fight against the right to the name of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always gone victory from these battles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, succeeded in defending the name of origin of the Olomo requirement, but they had to change the name of the national round, whose tradition in our country was revoked to the 19th century, and was called "Tuzemák".
Only products produced from sugar can be called ron, but not those factors from sugar remollates.
In the official list of protected original names of the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola chess known worldwide, the German town's mazapan Lübeck or Parma's japones, for example, Karlovy Vary's galletes, Pohorélice and Trèboň's carpets and even the variety of Jatec's bullets.
As protected marves of the EU, they may be proud of the pardubice and the ships of Horijce in Podkrkonoshi.
People want to save the Republic, but I'm an affair, Okamura
Mr Senator, how did you present the elections for the president?
It's not the senator of the president.
If it was all right in our country, then I would not present my candidate.
But I can no longer endure seeing how it was stolen in the last 20 years in our country, how the ladrons are impuned, the taxes and the age of jubilation are increased.
I had no ambitions to be political.
When I see something I don't like, I'm trying to make a solution to change it.
And since I have forty years and my candidature is independent, the only chance that I have to change is to present me as senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but a little later it has been put on the road to the presidency.
Doesn't you give back to those who have voted?
I always said that my candidature to the presidency depended on the results of the elections of the senate.
Later, I needed that if I had chosen senator, I would present my candidate to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make real my own ideas.
I therefore need the most possible influence and the strongest mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation we criticize in the bar or front of the television, but we strike anyone who wants to start a change.
That is what the communications means, which disappoint you and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom of lie.
I'm saying I've submitted journalists what I was adviser of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
Presidency's fight with financial and criminal responsibilities for politicians and the statement of property above twenty million.
For that, the law must be changed.
As the President, he has no competition and only the senate can offer laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a group of pressure so that the leader office may be recognized as self-working, and we have achieved it.
The problem is in the policy: if someone comes with a good proposal, either from the left or from the left, it is intentional and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to obtain support from all Parliamentary groups.
Without encassments or partial dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is better for our country and apply it.
Does it be considered more than a man of depths or left?
From the check point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left.
It doesn't matter to me, it's a little left or a bit of.
What I'm interested is that we're getting out of here.
I don't care if someone's on the left or left, I want to join people.
Always openly support any good solution, whether the proposal comes from the KSCHM or the ODS, and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.
It's crazy when you say it's popular.
But doesn't you demonstrate it with what he says?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have certain objectives and ideals.
And you're getting close to them.
There will be people who call it popular, but all the proposals I speak already work in the world or known experts are talking about them.
However, without Parliament's support, it is only given to him.
That is why it cannot survive in the long-term policy.
Or do you think that if you direct people and speak to them, you will, for example, achieve a criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and put them on my side to achieve it.
If the President had been chosen, there would be no problem in organizing a direct television transmission in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary party to legitimate criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officers, judges and fiscals of the state.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong person who points out the disputes, pressure can be made on the political scene.
Let us take the direct election of the President, which has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I feel that I'm just an affair, I'm not a genius or a intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals, I'm trying to find aliens.
I've just started in the policy and I'm trying to get the greatest support for my programme.
I'm trying to get things out of myself, but if it's not good, I'll leave it and return to the private sector within six years.
It sounds like Okamura was to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a saver.
I know that I don't do anything with a person, so I have visited a series of known personalities, for if they are best encouraged to present their candidature to the senator.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová, who led frauds with light heating oil.
I presented myself in part of the basis that people are really insatisfactory, now I'm in the balance.
The sixty per cent of the population did not come to the urnes and those who did it voted to the representatives of the establishment.
We are two of the independent sector in the senate.
People chose the senate, so it will be complicated to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct choice of officers or managers.
Are you considering to form your own party?
I haven't yet considered it because I have no time for it, to check the inconsistent past of each of the potential members of the party, neither do I have any money.
I have no money nor for the campaign at the presidency, in my transparent account there are only 200,000 crowns.
Doesn't you have money?
Speaking about property statements, how is yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague, I have an estimated area of 25 million, a rated degree of ten million, another degree of eight million, a collection of art works with a value of ten million, a Aston Martin of approximately 3.5 million and a Superb Schkoda valued in a million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
In fact, I have a Aston Martin because he was my younger dream. I always liked James Bond, who driving this car, was galant with women and, at the same time, struggled with wickedness and injustices.
Did you drive a Aston Martin, your property is valued in 60 million and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic but you don't want to put too much money on your own.
It's not very convinced.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I be stuck?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no patrocinators shows that there is no too much interest in my programme.
And I don't have the obligation to pay the campaign with money in my bottle.
The expenses of the campaign cover in essence what I will receive as a Senator's conception.
For example, I couldn't pay my son the English School, which costs 30,000 men's crowns.
If I just wanted to win money, I wouldn't present me as a candidate.
So you will continue with your business activity to live?
Didn't you say before I was going to leave this activity?
This doesn't have anything to do with an older swimming.
As I promised, in part I left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my substitute at first.
People want to be the Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How often do you win monthly as a businessman?
Among 200,000 to 400,000, I'm still wining.
If I was the president, I would leave business.
You can consult the whole interview on the and the Sabbath of Prava.
The MVRDV architecture study shows that the real aventuries are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "booting of books" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, has a future aspect, and finally there is something interesting to see," Lisette Verhaig, a transaction that goes through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, TI technician in a large company near the library, points: "But the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and electronic books.
Nobody's going in the past mode libraries, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom city at the doors of Roterdam, which merely deserves a fugitive visit, shows the doubt of having risen with a record to settle.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants represents the lowest rate of alfabetisation in the Netherlands.
To cope with this so shameful situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute somehow to the general culture and to copy the seven fictions that appear in the euro billets in the form of decorated armed hormone miniatures.
The success of educational offence was limited.
And this was how the political responsibles decided that there was only a possibility to improve statistics: it was to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Netherlands architecture study MVRDV, all a teacher in the art of the bars diagrams and responsible for entertained buildings to the Chinese couple, took the subject with its usual serenity and compared with the presentation of the concurrence in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile in the face.
And while the jury looked perplexly around him and covered his heads, Maas went to pillar the books by size forming a pyramide and concluded his short talk with the following words: "Dearly citizens:
Here you have, my proposal for the Mount of Spijkenisse's books, called 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is raised in the planned place.
This is a part of the revitalisation project, which is completed with a subterranean parking, a supermarket, a mail office and a couple of housing buildings and households.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books was galardonated with the second premium "Best Library of NL 2012".
Furthermore, the project is also designed to "Du日 National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small lacking city of history, which until the date had nothing but offering but a postmodern peatonal area and an incredibly foolish assembly after which a white fashion would rather intuirate a milk central, now with a contemporary architecture work.
But especially, Spijkenisse now has the first public public building of his history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a chess.
It is true that there is a risener who brings us right to the center of this mountainly mad, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to float with their topgraph at each step of their scale up to the top.
The completely acrystalated inside results easily and easily covering with the view, the covered floor ground and the elegant floors support the public with the library inequality.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you keep the view, you can see the park, dogs, children and girls playing football.
And on every side books, books and more books.
"Normally book stationaries are available throughout the façade and in the center it opens a huge dark room that usually becomes something uncomfortable and inpersonal," Winy Maas.
What we have done is putting foots up the classic space configuration and getting the reading area outside.
The inside of the mountain is very useful: the offices, the Internet library, the academic club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room are located in the media.
Specific mention deserves black stones that assume wall clothing functions, parapet and barandilla at the same time.
The view, the tact and the olfato are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers most daily take their head when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled material," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And this is like one day, in a fresh agricultural exploitation, we have the appropriate subproduct from agriculture.
Since many years, in the inver and in the Netherlands fields, a plastic weight of low weight millimeters has been used as a basis for submitting the roots of cultures.
It's a nice and nice material.
This finish weight is two stations and then leaves.
For the library, this weight was first printed in such quantities until it reached four centimeter wheel tables.
With the heat and pressure, the named agricultural plastic (KLP) changes in color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that flows to a new car mixture and deports.
After 105 pills come to the top of the mountain.
At the end of this road, we are waiting for nearly 500 meters around the mountain: from the cafeteria, there is not only a fantastic view of the city, but also enjoying a sabrous netherlands croquets and its figs planted in huge macetes.
These create a pleasant environment for the par that keeps the appropriate atmosphere humidity for this mountain.
Donations for a new stock
"Although it costs to believe it given to its large acrystalated surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in respect of theology," said Trouborst.
The necessary heating and refrigeration are obtained from geothermic energy.
Although the mountain of books is under an enormous cristal piramide, even in the most sunny days the sun sole has been in it for a few hours.
Enormous wood-searchs in transversal sense to the cristal fade serve to give shadow and absorb the majority of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable internal climate.
The rest is something of the automatic persians.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptic worker of the Information Technology Sector, has already been trained to put the feet in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig was there too.
Similarly, the Chinese traditional medical teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. It qualifys "Boekenberg" as the "slow soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, due to the inevitation that happened a few weeks ago, all the people of the city were invited to give a book of their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill up the optical places of a library that still doesn't account with its full file; now it has 70,000 examples.
The concept has lost hood.
The stations are filled.
"There is nothing worse than an average library," the Winy Maas architect.
"I think thanks to our initiative, all inhabitants now have a certain link to this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Although it's just to be worshipped.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved success in this discipline that in the specialised argument it is known as "creation of identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a part of the history of the spijkenisse.
Unlike the young man and inculcate that he can be.
Finally, a game point to comply with its identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a more protagonist role"
Germany has refused to vote on the admission of Palestine.
Stephen Szabo, expert in the US-Europe relations, is situated in Berlin in a very diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany understood that he would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territory with the United Nations observer State.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship that comes to the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I think that it doesn't also support North American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence without being too critical with Israel.
The rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was to establish a flight zone.
This has finally been declared by the NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when important international issues are in game?
Yeah, that's it.
This is why it is currently reorienting its external policy, removing from a leading policy, so that it is, by the United States, and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And more difficult things are that Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are in a cross-border.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to do it.
I think they are still trying to do what their role will be, but they have already started the way to a "normal" outer policy.
A external policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" external policy specifically mean from German viewpoint?
It is a policy that, in the case of national interests, is disposed to defend different positions than the United States or their European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is a strong motivation in the economic policy, namely in exports and their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Nearest East.
German economic interests are too different than those of other large powers, and therefore Germany should protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position adopted in relation to the conflict in the Near East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Near East, especially in the Golf.
For this reason, it must be careful and not deal with the Arabic public opinion nor with the Arab elite.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give you so much importance because it is not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany deceived its relationship with the United States by refusing to vote in important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine?
I think in Europe, even in the United States, German position enjoys a huge degree of understanding.
For this reason, I don't think there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has succeeded in a certain respect.
Finally, all this has not done but demonstrated that it is a country they take seriously as a international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. has been clearly shown for a veto.
Is there different opinions between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed due to the internal and political policy.
I think the Government of Obama shows in secret a great understanding towards the European position.
However, because of the political situation that is living here, it is evident that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the true difference in opinions does not actually have the envergature that it is assigned to.
If we analyze the relationships between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not an enthusiasm with the development policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to conciliate the east relationships that he maintains with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other hand?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for Germans if there was a coherent and homogene European policy, but it is not the case.
Therefore, they have no possibility to be part of a higher body, but they must impulse things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing with the euro now.
I think in the future Germany will take a leadership role at the time to force Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is nothing easy for Germany, but it is simply for the relationship that he maintains with Israel.
This has always been a fighting topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure.
Will Germany actually take a protagonist role?
Or maybe it's still difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet been used, it always results uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to play a more important role.
If we observe the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany is positioned as a major actor, some anti-German feelings are dismissed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
It's an old problem, and no one wants to be surrounded from the enemy countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
Show a recipient in front of the various neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The influence of the U.S. on the European Policy decreases more, but the EU does not cover this empty, who remains then?
The Germans will not have any more medicine than to take a more protagonist role.
Even if they don't like it, if it results unappreciable or if you make them a still more immortal city, it's life!

"Protection of marks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese marks
Armani is a globally known brand and Polo Ralph Lauren is also known.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name, a name is hidden officially registered in China but it has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, this is a pleasure of protection while the real eponisms do not present a request.
And even then it's not clear that you're going to give them the reason.
"Foreigners is more difficult to protect their marks in China," said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the Taylor Wessing buffet in violations of protection rights in the External East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
The imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their marks.
In this way, Gu’s become Lu-Gu and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies also are legally copied in the same way, as it has happened to the manufacturer of the Puma sports articles.
Pattloch opens a vector in which holds seats of the Pekín mark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the Zegna DF Puma mark, a artificial name that also served from the Ermenegildo Mode House Zegna.
That Chinese are world campaigns in copying and violating intellectual property rights is known above.
In the big cities there are large storages of several plants dedicated to the sale of sales.
However, Pattloch's cases are otherwise. Because of his customers, he fights the fact that the Chinese companies are officially conceived the right to take advantage of a name already registered in another place.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or the following mark.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
that refers to women who have "fished" to a rich man.
Chinese authorities are not guilty
"It's damageful for business, it's to fight against it," Pattloch requests.
"The mark makes water, the monopolist position disappears and the damage that the image suffers is great."
Financial losses and the processing costs of the sector concerned are millionary, especially in the case of luxe embryo products.
Data from the CLSA market analysis undertaking are given, with a amount of EUR 15,000 million per year, China is the third market of luxe articles and that grows at a higher level.
However, the cancellation of duty legality inscriptions in the brand record is complicated and also supplies much money.
Processes can be extended to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court disapproval a claim because he had spent so long that the name of the request had already become a "market reality".
"If the applicant has bad lucky, may even have to pay money to the player because the process has hurt this mark in China," said Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the forest's law.
Some of the most known cases have to be regarded with graphical elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a fight against the Main Building Manufacturer Sany, the company that was recently absorbed by the German Hermigion Bomb Manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, today Chinese can continue using a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
The buyer of Volvo, Geely, used at the beginning a white and white logo that reminded BMW largely; the matter was addressed in the courts and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against followers from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a cocodril looking at the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities are not guilty.
The CTMO mark office in Pekín recognises that in 2010 they have experienced difficulties due to lack of equipment and staff funding.
The last year, however, "the situation of work emergency returned to normality."
In this way, the number of non-training complaint processes has been reduced to 22%.
Nearly 57.000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81.500 complaints are followed by resolutions.
Warning against this costs much money
As often being usual in China, the numbers are amazing.
The last year, CTMO registered more than 1.4 million mark protection applications, almost one third of them in 2010.
It would be a new record, and it means that China leads the list of new records worldwide for a decade year, marking office is signed.
It seems that this also occurs with the number of valid logos, a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.800 million yuanians would have been paid in the concept of rights.
Otherwise, this means that each average cost inscription is ≥80 yuan or EUR 160.
To fight this costs much money, as shows the case of the German family company joynberg.
For more than seven years ago, the group fights in courts against a Chinese imitator.
Although Germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of parts of imitation car,
the imitator has achieved the assurance of Chinese rights on the joynberg mark.
"We have provoked this situation because the calls are not protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, President and Adviser Delegated of joynberg Chemical Specialities in Múnich.
The CTMO mark office also disapproval the resource of the municipalities.
In the following two instances, the reason for joynberg has been given, but the opposite part is still fighting at present.
You must be very careful
The case has now arrived at the doors of the Supreme Court of Justice, where it remains a resolution.
Wentzler trusts that he can resolve the question and praise the professionality of the courts.
However, it is also that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the business file had to review documents of up to hundred years of anti-equity to be able to provide tests.
Fem years ago, joynberg offered an "sum of six digits in euros" to reach a friendly agreement, but it did not succeed.
"This shows how much we care," Wentzler said.
The dangers accepted in the External East are even threatened by affecting Europe,
specifically if the imitators are there to ensure the rights on unprotected marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name joynberg for shoes and skin products in Germany.
Ago the group has abandoned this trade area, however it has been able to prevent the registration.
"I must be very careful," -- Wentzler.
As well as the lawyer Pattloch recommends German companies who are extremely able to make business with China.
It is not enough to trust international mark rights legislation, but what is needed to do is "recording also in China all that can be susceptible of protection", as Wentzler pointed out.
Instead, the theme can be much more decent than a simple record.
In fact, if gladnberg lost the last attack of his particular battle, then it would have to pay the contrary party license rights for its own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment concerned would be thrown out of the market.
World day of fight against AIDS: Dancing, song, help
Heidelberg tests the coro Imbongi and Swaziland rejoices the AIDS poor
The history of a link is able to exceed much more than 8.733 km away.
First starts by the dance: cowboy bottles, baloncest shoes, tacton shoes and motasines are looking for compass on the ground of the parquet, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then, the voices of the songs begin to be slowly elevated (contrast, lower, tender, and superno), arremolin’s becomes, incredible, and follows each other.
And Fiete Hopf, 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his boxes by putting order with his energy and mild gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the Music Room of the Heidelberg Medical Psychology Institute, the coro Imbongi tests a new song.
The fifty songs, from between 23 and 69 years, have also come from human genetic to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not a easy piece, each crowd's voice has a different text and also in a foreign language only known: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for autohelp
UNIDAD is estimated, the United Nations AIDS programme, and there are some 34 million people infected by HIV virus worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245.000 poor people from AIDS.
More than 40% of the population is already zero.
Association Voices for Africa has found padrinos in Germany for the 180 orphans of the AIDS of the city of Estoni.
Seventy of them attend the secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, a child can be paid.
This contribution will cover the school registry, the uniform and will ensure a warm food daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in sulu "historic prominent" or "panegirist".
In this room, no one can speak fluidly this buntu language, but to sing you know.
Since ten years ago, this coro tests songs in this sweet foreign language that sometimes has been able to transport them to their origin: South Africa.
At 8.733 km directly online from Heidelberg, north-east of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a people called Esitani that depends on the voices of this German coron.
40 percent is infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple shapes of barry and beach, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 people have no parents anymore because they've seen the AIDS.
Esitzeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest expectations of life in the world, is Unicef.
The population does not see the circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been demonstrated is reduced to half the risk of counterfeit.
More than 40% of Swaziland's residents are immune deficiencies, and death with something more than 30 years has become a normal thing.
A joint journey to Africa on the early morning of 2005, the coro discovered this rejoicing population, but mostly many children saw in the streets that lacked not only the protection of their parents, but also the main: food, clothing and training.
Without school title, the possibilities in a poor country are more than low.
In principle, it was only the particular commitment of a few things that would make a child out of the college and enjoy a hot food daily, all this for a few euros.
However, one year later, the coro found the "Voices for Africa" association that has since then been professionally occupied with AIDS poor people in Estoni.
Acts on sexual transmission infections
What are the main sexual transmission diseases?
Among the ETS of origin are sifilis, clamidia and gonorrea.
The most usual virus ETS are AIDS, human papiloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The lads and the sorcers are among the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected ones?
Siphilis and gonorrea are more frequently given in men who maintain sexual relations with others.
The Institute Robert Koch part of the basis that at least four of each five cases of sifilis registered in Germany have its origin in sex between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, most usual sexual transmission diseases are clamidia, tricomons, human papiloma virus, candidiasis (hongo) and gonorrea.
The countdown of HIV among hetherosexual adults in the country is low; however, approximately 20% of the new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among youths, clamidia infections are much more habitual than in other population groups.
European investigations are addressed, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
In our country, human papiloma virus is also added to the most habitual diseases between youth.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexual transmission diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
Institut Robert Koch, the number of sifilis infections doubled its number of 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has maintained a descending trend since 2007.
In 2011 approximately 2.700 cases were registered.
It is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venerous disease?
Infectional diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, urinary disorders, fluid, abdominal pain, as well as ampoules or crashes.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms, and therefore they are not detected.
How can one protect?
Reservatives can reduce the risk of counterfeit, but they do not offer protection to 100 per cent.
Some patogenic agents of sexual transmission diseases may also be transmitted to infections by suicide and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend to be regularly subject to medical examinations, especially if they are often changed by sexual couples.
If they are temporarily, the majority of the ETS can be cured and it is possible to avoid any subsequent consequences.
A ○ of cooperation, donations, and, finally, but not less important, of the honoraries covering the coro for their actions in all Germany are to recover a lot of money.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitzeni," said proud Annette Lennartz, President of the Association.
In the own people Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman of herself and with leadership donors managed the money sent from Germany.
It is concerned that poor people find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandparents.
The "gogos", as called older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans at their charge, offer them a tissue where they live, and they care that children come to school every day pointly and dressed with their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two kitcheners who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary of the association.
Furthermore, "Voices of Africa" has launched a coast school, built two gallines and, in collaboration with the sana and PSI organization, has achieved that many of the people have been subject to a HIV test.
This is not obvious, because, despite the patent that this disease is in the whole country, it is not often talking openly about it.
A King with 14 wives
"The AIDS is an absolute tabu," Annette Lennartz, "for sexuality has to be done."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known by its opulent and full lifestyle.
Polygamie instead of democracy.
This form of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for so fast propagation that has experienced HIV virus in the last decades.
But it is also due to the innumerable timers that run the country from one side to another and bring it there where they go.
See Annette Lennartz, "in any of the iss can be achieved free reserves, but these are only used.
It's another culture, here they only accept the skin contact against skin."
To promote cultural exchange, the coron Imbongi travels every two or three years in southern Africa, singing songs that speak of melancholia, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southern extreme of the African continent still correspond to the time of the apartheid.
A bus full of white songs in a black language; so much recognition brings not only here an excellent environment and great joy, but has also been able to drag a couple of tears to some other fronter’s soldiers.
The journey always brings them to Esitzeni, where the songs visit the patherinated children.
Although this small population appears only on the maps, in the river E′weni valley is very known.
"Appeal to Esitani, there is light," the people of the place.
And after running the 8.733 miles on line to Heidelberg to the street test rooms of Bergheimer, full of songs marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercurio
The Messenger sonda has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercurio.
Probe the ice layer has a weight of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the North American Space Agency, has made evidence of the existence of ice in Mercurio.
Despite the nearest planet of the sun, there is also iron water, as it is drawn from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger's sonda would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently located in the shadow a ice layer has been made.
It seems to have at least 30 centimeters and probably even 20 meters of weight.
The water seems to come from comets or, with great probably, of asteroids that shocked against Mercurio on his day.
No one relates to ice finding with the possibility that there is life on the planet, the head investigator of the sonda Messenger, Sean Solomon.
Temperature in Mercurio can reach up to 426 degrees.
However, findings could help to explain how water and other components of life have reached to other areas of the solar system.
In a completely advertised way for the inhabitants of the Earth Planet, sonds, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are dedicated to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the size of the space.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers of the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that meet our solar system, as well as the planet Ceres.
Like Pluton, which turns around the right sun behind Neptuno, the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is not a "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "Family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as points to points, although the most difficult to recognize is the rose color of the stars "received birth".
This street of star training, called little romanticly by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope at the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6.500 light years.
This image returned from an extinction star was taken by the Spitzer telescope of the NASA.
The ring in the form of donut is composed of the material that the star split in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifida Nebulosa, at 5.400 years of light of the Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's telescope Spitzer took this photo from the galaxy star training area.
The Pleyadas, a group of stars also known as the supernome of "The Seven Sisters", are a simple object in the nightly heaven.
However, with the telescope, the colors can be better.
The Nebulosa of the Helise appears like a huge red eye appears in this image of infrared.

Depending on tonalities, some images of spirital galaxies become true artistic works.
The image published by the Australian European Observatory shows the Trifida Nebulosa that has been held for several thousands of light years in the constellation of Sagitary.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (splittered in three), since some dark powder lines divide the heart hanging from this star training area in three lobbles.
In the constellation of Office, the astronomes were able to photograph the indications of a cosmic character: 400 million light years of Earth are the two-found galaxies nuclears equipped towards each other to finish choking in irremediable way.
This sharing of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spirital galaxie M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the surname of Molinillo Australia.
The graph of the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Nebulosa Iris in the Cefeo constellation.
The flashing at 1.400 years of light is composed of powder parts whose size is between 10 and 100 times smaller than that of the powder parts we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiografies made by different telescopes.

This star training area produces constantly new stars.
In this star cloud, associated with the Roseta Nebulosa, there are also constantly new stars; 5000 light years of the Earth.
In this so cold galaxie with a small black hole yet there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe could be found above all.
Our Window to the Universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 before Galileo Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, speechs of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and images that offer us have more deepness.
It is 30 years, particularly from 1947 to 1975, the Hale’s telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the biggest in the world.
His speech, on the image, had a five-meter diameter.
The Big Binocular Telescope is raised in Ar′na, USA.
This allows you to watch the cosmos at two speechs, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inside of the Grand Telescope Canarias on the island of La Palma is enormous - only the speech has a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The speech of Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to cover costs.
Despite that, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The inconvenience of this most economic building is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Your particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
While counting with a comparatively smaller speech diameter, that capacity is equipped with the largest speech telescope in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of alien life.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "External Intelligence Search" (SETI for its centuries in English) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.

Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope who honors his name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illustrate the average infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also accept the name E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Telescope Extremly Great).
Your primary speech shall cover 42 metres and will be composed of a total of 1000 reflecting elements.
Until 2018, it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
By 2007, the two Keck's telescopes in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the biggest in the world.
These are two speechs, each of them with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of Mauna Kea Observatory, which with them explores the sky with the Suparu telescope and the IRT.
Mauna Kea is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a 30-metric speed diameter.
This is a picture of how it would be.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he sends pictures of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler spatial telescope seeks extrasolated planets, especially those who are residents.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that from the beginning of its mission ≥35 candidates to planets had been located.
On the picture, the last preparations before Kepler's space telescope is seen.
The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched at the board of a Ariane 5 to 2018.
The primary speech of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the functions of this telescope will seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers are part of the basis that there is also ice in the South Pool of Mercurio.
However, there are no fascinating evidence, since the Messenger sonda turns back to the planet in a much closer orbit north.
Since many years, radar measurements point to the existence of ice in Mercurio.
Thanks to the sonda Messenger (2004), the first orbiting in return to Mercurio, now the scientists have the sure that it is.
Drink daily bottle and live 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people are able to reach Bible age.
There is even a museum dedicated to long age.
A stream search in a country where 97-year-old people are still considered young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people are able to reach Bible age.
There is even a museum dedicated to long age.
A stream search in a country where 97-year-old people are still considered young.
The resort by the Talysh mountain region could be qualified of wild and romantic.
The minibus goes greatly stretched to the sinuous road that goes around the side of wooden hills, rivers of large cadal and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and jug, one could even think it's in the Black sauce.
However, we are in the southern area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers.
Here are the "talyshi", a people of which they do not know much, except that they are perfectly dominated by the Persian and the Azer, and they are very long.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city is assumed of a architecture may be too maciz designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to seem to be involved in a so pintorous mountain landscape.
European tourists only come to this place, since the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To run the 323 kilometers that separate both urban nuclears, eight hours are needed because the road is in one sense.
The amazing richness of which the country enjoys thanks to the Caspio Sea oil has not yet reached this renowned region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what he needs to have to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku has become awesome in May because of the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and the next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," said Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight hundred talyshis of the place that has over 100 years of age. Fatulayeva marks a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years old.
His son died at the age of 136 years
However, the unusual star of the museum is the shepherd of the sheep Shirali Müslümov, which seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth party that certifies it.
And if we note that the older age man lived 122 years, the age of Müslümov seems to be very suspicious.
"Nation in the region in 1805 and died in 1973", explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. It seems like he still had time to build a daughter more than 136 years old.
Did Sherali Müslümov wrong in his age in a couple of dees?
However, the gerontologist of the Max Planck Institute of Rostock has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan also live a very advanced age people," -- Scholz, "There are many older men in Cerdeña."
Because of the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence on age; maximum when there is no civil registry.
Every day, wheat filled with red bottle
It is a fact that the residents of the region, in turn to Lerik, are extremely common to reach a Bible age.
There are now 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
Why do you live here, in the south, so many older people?
The Azerian tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the Museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause resides in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that exactly the rich food in the calories of the talyshi, who worship meat, bread, and above all the milk products, and many of which, in addition, drink a daily wheat of distressed bottle, is so healthy.
Or maybe the form of natural life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small seat from Lerik's city lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At its 97 years, he is young for what it is set for these breedings.
Mirzayeva, who has 143 descendants, lives in a simple typical wood house in the whole region of Caucaso.
Sit on the ground, it moves inconsciently a huge bottle tiny.
Eight people live under a cup, among them one of the children and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents ago.
They also spring from one side to two small children.
In the kitchen, they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that serves in typical vessels in a bad form.
Myrzayeva's teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the pawn hides two long holes of dark hair that your son discovers us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I've never fallen and kept his colour.
"I've never used a champagne either," Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what was produced in his own farm: tomates, bottles and guiseants.
I've never gone to buy a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the time after the Second World War.
However, everything returned to his cup when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took the control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan, the worship of the fatherly figure of the nation, which leads its country as a dictator, does not know limits.
This remained in power until 2003, at the time the testimony was given to his son Ilham.
At least the older people of Azerbaijan don't know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva covers 230 manates (approximately the same amount in euros) as pension concept, a quantity with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And maybe the mild son of Mirzayeva has the right: "In our culture, the older ones are very respected."
They live in a large family, they are loving, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to keep life for many years...
The Constitution does not contain the expression "Man's Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Revelations that arising each other in Cairo show the tremendous division in which the country is located.
The future constitution, with the sherry as a base, is very controversy.
The Egyptian president did not escape in patetism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he advised in public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially to the Christian cops, the liberals, the Muslims, and the centuries.
All of them, without medicine until now in a confused opposition, have fear.
Meeting theocracy at the ears of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for perdition, he had to temporarily cancel the competences of the Constitutional Court and expand its "to be able to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate title approved by the Southern University of California really wants to save.
Do you expect to be free of your power to judgement?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 islamists mostly in a 15-hour nighttime, are truly concerned.
As in previous constitutions, the removal also states that the jurisprudence is based on the "principes of the Islamic Right".
But what does that mean of "principies"?
This was and still open to the interpretation, and it seems that the Islamics will use this vague formulation, as well as the legal maniobrage margin which has appeared, to introduce a stricter interpretation of the sherry.
This is at least what a new article suggests: In all the issues related to the sharia, it is mandatory to consult the University of Al-Ashar, the most important islamic institution of the country with great power in the whole islamic suni.
It doesn't have to be so, but this may mean that the church would control the legislation, something that, in fact, would result in the incapacity of judgement.
Many of the constitution's deletor are open to interpretation
It also results in problems is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
Mubarak's dictature these courts served to exercise a strong repression on opposition.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11.000 civilians were arrested in military premiums.
As stated by the removaler, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "the promotion of its moral and values".
It is so impressive in legal terms that with the support of this article, state institutions could even control the contents of the film and the film.
Clearly, it's not something else than censure.
Certainly, no article explicitly sets the equality between men and women.
Instead, another prohibits offending or disappointing the Prophet Mohammed and his associates.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how to be sanctified.
The same is the formulation that prohibits the "defence to people"
Is it enough for the president's carcake or a chist on a letter?
The question of interpretation, as many other things in the removal, which has been presented to Mursi for his signature and which is, its words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be subjected to referencendum.
"The revolution has returned"
Weeks ago the opposition has closed rows before the superiority of the Islamics.
Ten thousand people gathered in an inu harmonia on Friday afternoon at the Tahrir of the Cario Place and swore to make the Act failure before they could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end winning," HAMDIN Sabbahi, who takes the third place in the lists of presidential elections.
The Nobel of Peace and Exdirector of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the constitution's deletor should be "in the cube of the story's crash".
The Twitter accused Mursi's followers of being able to lead a "State Kipping against Democracy".
"When he calls the referendum we go to his palace and throw it down," or Jasser Said.
"We are not still tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiated," it was quoted in the Egyptian media to the politician or Chaled Ali politicians.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Coran is our constitution"
On its part, the well-organized Muslim community made an invitation to celebrate a contra-manifestation; for if not at the Tahrir place, but after a prayer at the other side of the Nilo, before the University of El Cairo.
Many women with a view and partitaries of the salafists participated in the same crie: "the people require the application of God's law."
They requested Mursi "clearing the country" at the same time they announced: "The Coran is our constitution."
A battle for the sovereignty of the Simetic Place Tahrir, where they eat everything, would have caused a similar situation to the civil war.
It is obvious that Mursi's partners did not want to risk that something like this happens.
The Muslim brothers have said that both those who oppose themselves to the deletor of the constitution and the parties of it would have expressed their high and clear opinions.
Now it would have been time to allow the people to decide in the urnes what direction the country should follow.
In this regard, it seems that the islamists' removal has guaranteed most of them.
"The expression 'Music Rights' doesn't appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that actually should have been to February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old lawyer in human rights and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were arrested in prison or had to face a sentence during the dictature of Mubarak.
Not because he would have his ideology, but because for him human rights are indigenous.
For this reason, he was struck, condemned and imprisoned.
"And now the expression `Music Rights' doesn't appear in the new constitution," he regrets in a conversation with the magazine "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Mursi's powers to the three powers of the State has made this lawyer reject.
The measures adopted are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead to Egypt to a new dictature.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, what the President has done is to abolite it," Saeda regrets.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda also feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological fight that is going on at the river's ears with a mix of curiosity and stress.
This could return to your opposite.
A manifestant at Tahrir place warns: "You are designing a monster that you can't control."
The Norwegian rakfish: Is the most evil fishermen in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the largest levels of life, not only from Europe but from the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country keeps a relationship with its availability by an extremely malicious fisherman?
Take a series of very healed chess.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of sweet and humid football clothing.
Leave it a week.
Then you can go to the paralyzant aroma of the rakfisk, one of Norway's exquisites.
I'm in the small city of Fagernes, about three hours in Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular, and that hole, always present, float in the air.
The rakfisk is thrown in saladion that allows it to be fermented in water during, depending on how badly you would like it, up to a year.
As it darkens and makes more cold, the Norwegians come to a festival that is celebrated here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this food as much as so, so, captive.
"They eat cruel and then drink a aquavit vessel of a tragedy," says Havard Halvarsen, a city bomber who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
On every side we see people eat this fish that is stored in small cubes and drink of a huge amount of drink.
"Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," ○ Havard.
Drink can kill the bullet.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different than a part of sushi that has run a few kilometers in bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different period, in which Norway’s poverty was poverty and in which, before the refrigeration, the fishing was kept during the water-summered otone and salted in hermetical barriers.
Later, in full winter, when it is already well fermented, it gets out and, obviously, with inactive feelings due to alcohol, it eats.
There was only one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians have seen obliged to leave their country in the search for work, and they have migrated mainly to the United States.
The population is currently increasing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high salaries and a full social services system.
A flow of residents in Sweden, the old rival, and even a long time too richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, a key part, although very malicious, of the past of Norway.
It is located among the most precious plates that can be purchased.
But actually, it's dear. A beer dog or a sandwich cost you the 10€ cooler (14$) each.
Norway does not often appear in the agenda of the international news and most norwegians like that.
Here people are still little ready to proclaim the name of Anders Breivik, the extreme racist of Others, who killed 77 people, among whom there were men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the Tyrotheum as "the event of July 22".
Norwegians are very worthy to believe that one of them was able to commit such cruelty and murder in their paused country.
After a lot of the current riches in Norway, growth is found from the beginning of the 70s of one of the biggest oil and gas industry in the world.
"But the oil is not the only reason for which we go so well," -- our colleague, while it's going through crack bands and that, with its long melena rubies and his surprising eyes to the Norwegian welfare, represents the picture of the Norwegian welfare.
"We are, as you said, people do."
Your English, like most people in this country, is impecable.
"We don't like lavardeing, we don't like obstentation."
Norway has managed its oil riches with very care; all, except a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While all of the world had no money for the years that predicted financial crisis worldwide, Norway kept the currency well closed.
"When we can swim in winter and make senderism in summer, we are happy," he says.
"And eat rakfisk," adds with a carcased design.
I'm on snow to make school to eat something; I've had enough rakfish.
Now a hamburger of alce is no doubt something different and quite suckle to sabor.
But for the night, come back to that fishing malician.
The hotel in which I acquire is one of the many locals where a rackfisk dinner is celebrated in which the commissals vote the best fishermen, or maybe the most testing narrows.
A television has directly connected to a shower that carries a pajarita and is surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It seems to be the Eurovision concurrence.
"What are your scores for the best fishing up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"This is our score, Havard."
There's laughs and applauses.
A man falls out of the chair, perhaps winning by the aquavit.
Or maybe they're the vapores of all that fisherman.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto is at a hard start
While the incoming president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is prepared to take possession of its charge, the BBC responsible, Will Grant, analyses the challenges to which the new president and the various expectations of its population will be taken.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad at present.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congestioned, has been installed a steel circle from Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and causes a huge chaos on the streets.
The objective, however, was not to prevent the workers from reaching their jobs, but to avoid that manifestants could reach the parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and adopt the management of the nation.
It's a complicated task.
Mexico has gained good economic results during the outcome government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in a war against drug traffic, which has been covered for about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has the great commitment with the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto explained at the beginning of this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Spach.
"I'll propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before being covered with the President of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as the Governor of his national state, the Mexico.
A very popular state and with a quick growth, around the capital; the opinions on the new leader are divided in this territory where he was supposed to move.
A Honest Man
In the buccolica town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is recognized with love.
Their residents attribute to him the debt of tourism growth in the place and infrastructure construction.
To reach the city, one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto can be driven, which is a huge improvement compared to the landed and filled with bottles that have been rehabilitated.
Places with their name can also be seen in the entry of a modern polyportive and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and sustainable change," says his friend Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a member of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the Price.
"Particularly, as regards security and economy, we expect the interesting and true change that our country so much needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in the power, the PRI was disrupted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Mr Olvera admits that, after 12 years out of the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations for Enrique Peña Nieto within the party.
It also rejects the valuation that the opposition causes the lack of essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere, very committed man and with a great vision of the country.
He's a great state man and, above all, he's a person who can listen."
However, on the other hand of that state, it is not the impression that many people have on their former ruler.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as City Neza, the contrast with the gates of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Under high self-pista trames is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And municipality's problems are also hard and urban.
At the beginning of this year, military intervention was requested to help the fight against drug bands operating in the bars and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a wilderness park, with a bastard, the bodies of thousands of murdered women have been abandoned in only the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico state while Mr. Penya Nieto was the ruler, a much higher rate than the city of Juárez, despite its violence and a place that is synonymous of murdering innocent women.
Mr. Penya Nieto's critics say, in the best of the cases, that I was not able to address the problem of feminism while he was in charge.
The most critical accuses your administration of making the fat view.
In a hormigone house, typical of the deteriorated village, Irinea Buendia has to make effort to contain the tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version of the facts is, Mariana suicided in 2010.
However, his family believes that her couple killed her.
"When I came to her house, she seemed like they had made her body," recalls Mrs. Bondnia.
"It had signs that it had been struck and the mortal rigor had already appeared."
While his mother relates the story, a Charactergraph of Mariana observes from the walls, near a cross where one word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says he has been rejected.
"State's authorities have treated me as if I was an old chismous, an arrootator, a cheese.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and let it be quiet."
"But that can not be so when so many irregularities and so much neglects have been."
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied with a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico during the last six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during its mandate.
"I hope that it is the same type of president that was when he was a Governor," said Pri Olvera member in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Neza city are more afraid.
Bradley Manning didn't claim bad treaties, they're taxors
The chargers are trying to face Bradley Manning's offences during their detention
The judgment is focused on the Manning period in the military prison of Quantico in Virginia
Defence wants to disappreciate the case basically when Manning's prison was severe
The military soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The fiscals tried to demonstrate on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest confidential information filtering in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to claim bad treatments that he now claims he suffered while he was under military arrest.
The investigation that the fiscality carried out to Manning in a preview of the judgment in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Commander Ashden Fein, suggested that the records of the weekly visits of officers of the unit that Manning received for nine months of arrest in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaint on the treatment he received.
The questionnaire, which was carried out during a view made by the defence request that it would disapproval the case because its prison had been hard and that it had already been punished enough, came on a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of self-suicity while he was arrested.
The army intellectual analysis, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while served in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
On Wednesday, Fein reviewed the forms that the officers filled after their visits to Manning during their arrest in the military prison of Quantico, where he was arrested in a maximum reclusion regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have made questions to Manning and noted their answers.
When Wednesday Fein asked about the formulaes, Manning recognized that he had qualified the treatment that the cellors gave him as "excellent" and the treatment received in the installations in general as "very professional".
The formulaes show no accusation of bad treatments, although the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein advised.
Manning replied that he had expressed anxiety on some issues and that the officers who visited him had spoken of these problems and told him that they would be treated, but that they did not leave the consciousness of these issues in the register.
"They were writing 'unseen' (after having spoken of the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problem," said Manning.
The Court of Justice, Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not claimed the treatment he had received during the period of January 2011 with a advice to examine the intentions of suicide that he had expressed in a month before.
Manning replied that his intention was to obtain the reduction of the "prevention of lessons" regime under which it was found.
The soldiers said that they had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is a degree under the possible self-suicide, to ensure their protection and security of others.
"I wanted the greatest state to know that I was good and (will) stop being under prevention of lessions... so that I could enjoy what, from my view, is a better quality of life," said Manning.
Manning testified on Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was arrested for almost two months before he was sent to the military prison based on the Marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered self-suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost knowledge due to heat.
He said that the fact that you would not be allowed to know what was happening to you or what happened in the outer world was very anxious.
"My world was just reduced to the Arafjon camp, to that bottle," said Manning on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that bottle."
Manning advised that once after Quantico, most days passed in a small cell, at least 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said that it was just allowed to have a cow, a mantle, a few cancles, something of clothes and his hair.
He explained that he was moving all the time, because he was going to sleep or even get to stumble during the day.
Manning acknowledged that he always had a outcoming light pointing to his eyes while he slept.
He said that if the cells couldn't see his face when the night was returned, they wake him to return.
In January 2011, the lawyer of Manning presented a formal complaint on the treatment of Manning.
Manning was sent to Fort Leaven's military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Wednesday the judge asked Manning about a statement made in the statement of Thursday, which, after having been obligated a night to sleep naked in its quantico cell, was obliged to stay standing up before the cellors and other prisoners during a morning account.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover the coat during the account.
It's the interrogation of the judge on Friday, Manning said he dedued by the order that he gave him the census to leave the mantle with which he could have fallen, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to leave her falling.
Manning testified on Thursday that they had forced him to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to demonstrate a officer that he did not provide a danger for himself.
Manning appealed that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his inner clothes or his sands to self-leasing but that he hadn't done it.
Manning testified that that night they had removed from their cell their inner clothes, their sands and their walls.
His lawyers have the hope that the judge takes at least into account the experiences in prison during and reduces its judgment drasticly if he is condemned in the war advice, which is intended to begin at the beginning of the next year.
The defence appealed that it was intended to make Manning declare guilty of minor crimes and to defend other claims considered too extremely.
The view is expected to be renewed this weekend and it is expected that tax officers argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon stressed that Manning was held in accordance with the standards of application to all prisoners found under maximum preservation in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally providing information publishing on the Internet, filtering information on national defence and roof of property or public records.
If it is declared guilty of all charges, it could be held in perpetual chain.
My Mexican identity crisis
Aspire that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexican people tend to criticize those who went away; he says they comply with the Mexican people of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexico and Mexico are captured between two worlds.
In a recent trip to Mexico City, he had just been down by the explanated and reached the immigration processing area and was already completely confused.
Some cartels indicated the way to two rows: one for "Mexico" and another for "Externals".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
As I have grown in Central California, I've been called "mexican".
It's ethnic tachygraphy, the same way my boston friends refer to themselves as "Ireland" or my friends in New York, "Italian".
Later, I decided to be "mexican-e".
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's country, taquigraphy or scriptures were not necessary.
It was simply and.
I speak Spanish. It's good enough to handle me during a interview in this language.
But I don't have the level of vocabulary of a national and I can't dismiss my American accent.
So I took my passport and put me in the foreign school.
I thought at the time of this week when the president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, had visited the White House to meet President Obama.
In the agenda of the day, as when the leaders of these two countries are gathered, it consisted of immigration, drugs and trade.
Penya Nieto was also trying to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons for which at this time is so much that a Mexican stays in Mexico as it is going to go to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a trade block in North America in the European Union's style.
Furthermore, Penya Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cards in Mexico, even though he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is filled with refrigeration.
Probe the majority of e ́s never agreed that in 1848 the United States invade Mexico and forced its leaders to cease half of their territory to a gun point.
But for the mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that are composed are everywhere.
So, at the time one of the United States' officers say anything that takes the least critical to Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how and how they are enduring the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Moctezuma are standing in war.
Yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really has a challenge is the one with more than 35 million Mexican and Mexico who live in the United States.
Are we talking about remorse?
There's a lot.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others that are not so.
The only reason for which there are so many mexican people living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point of our genealogic tree, there was a person, perhaps the father or mother or any of the grandparents, to which the door of opportunities in Mexico was closed and had to go north.
And most times that person was involved in a given profile: dark skin, a low level of studies, from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And, although we may live now the American dream, having gone to good schools and had good works, we can never see that what we're living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexico.
Sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty is so.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are conscious that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the leader class do not like them.
The feeling is changed.
It sees us as a reminder of a humiliating hurt and looks at us above the cover as if we were from a lower category that is not enough mexican.
Our Spanish will never be enough good and our links with Mexico will never be enough strong.
As you see, our existence is a synonym of failure.
If our families hadn't fail in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves captured after this seed cover, living well in the United States, but yet, as solar souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and was legally born to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this rock between the Mexicans and the Mexicans and the Mexicans, because the first know more solidly who they are and the seconds this molest them.
Although it is a citizen of the United States, it is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican and I know feel that they are not part of any of the two.
We love to listen to the Mexican group Los North Tigres, but too to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you're not thrown to any of them.
In Mexico, you see us like and.
And in the United States, we are mexican.
Now, to complicate even more things, so I have heard during my travel, some Mexico leaders and some intellectual leaders want to go back to the diaspore.
They want Mexico and Mexico to work as improvised Embassy Employers, representing their interests in the United States.
We would say to our companions and companions how wonderful it is to visit that country and we would press political leaders to strengthen their links with Mexico.
Yeah, of course...
That won't happen.
There's too much break.
And, with the disgust of salaries, the galoping corruption and violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna stay alone with this idea, friends.
That's right.
If some Mexico people are still not ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a half ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexico and Mexico are still feeling for how they treated their families a very less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "mexican" than I thought.
Ancient battles, new Middle East
The high fire between Israel and Hamas could be a little base for peace
Can there be a long-term peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood waste that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the unusual and habitual discussions about whom the first place is, many buildings have been reduced to shops; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civils, and six Israelites have been murdered, and for the first time missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel A, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although the Israelites and the Palestinians seem to be enclosed in their former conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab primaver has left him all the facts they like or not, Palestinians and Israelites have been captured in the regional armor.
Maybe this makes your fight still more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons for thinking that their deadly situation could be disturbed.
A war that doesn't lose or win
Firstly, optimism seems currently very difficult to justifie.
Even if the fire agreed on 21 November is maintained high, this week's halcons have strengthened both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has governed Gaza since 2007, will have forced the Israelites to leave, although Gaza has received a good palace.
And despite having killed some of their leaders and pressed the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most weakest and populations of the planet, Israel was not able to end with Hamas.
In fact, Hamas wins land in West-Yordania, the other part of Palestine currently governed by its implacable rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders could conclude that time is playing for them.
Since the Islamics have gone to gain influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renewable regional power that had previously been the nearest Muslim Alliance to Israel, has distorted the cause of Hamas. It has also made Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic states of Golf.
Hamas' rejoicing members say that the half-islamist moon is rounding Israel, from Lebanon to north, where Hezbulá is dominating the milicy party, passing through Syria, where the rebels of a more islamist trend could break Bashar Assad until Jordan, where Hamas' allies are threatening the king.
In particular in the southern floor of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brothers addressed by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt has changed the balance of the region, in contrast to the most popular and fundamental Arab countries.
Hosni Mubarak, the lake depote that ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslims are the first brothers of Hamas and their leaders of more than the popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may be a protagonist to whom it cannot be excluded, either Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hard wings of Israel will bring the contrary conclusion.
As regards the military issue, they have put Hamas in its place.
The Iron Cupula Antimisile System of Israel has demonstrated its efficiency and many of Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelites will sleep quietly... for a while.
As regards the diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also committed Hamas to the latest oil of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a Prime Minister who has broadly ignored the peace process.
Although the shooting cockets from Gaza have ended with the lives of some 30 Israelites since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, in part thanks to the barrier that corrupts the West-Yordanian, the main part of an aspirant territory to become Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish seats that continue to increase, though, international legislation is illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of still stronger lines led by Avigdor Lieberman during the previous election period on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why do you mix these Palestinian retors with a own state?
If they actually rule in West-Yordania, wouldn't they shoot cockets like they did their partners in Gaza?
It's better to keep them behind that wall and give them a good shot if they get up their head.
Perhaps the heavy wheel is put, although the Arab primavery could change its estimates.
Although islamists who take power in Egypt and other sites do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to face internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than the four of its four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economy.
That Mr. Morsi's pragmatic has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire high is a good thing and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also think long-termly.
With the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, the Palestinians of their right to self-determination should create a dust that will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week exploded a bus in Tel A.
Repression is already mixing the democracy in the Jewish state and demography decreases the situation as the Arab population increases.
The cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years in order to make Hamas will pay a more diplomatic peague.
Both sides need a puzzle of people quickly at the conflict.
The solution continues to be the one that calls intelligent people from both sides, most of the outermost world and this magazine: two states and territorial suspension by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small to short term, is that the high fire gives a little more impulse to the people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to put the weapons in Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in a situation without a position to convince Hamas that he accepts the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967, with land exchanges and a Jerusalem.
Arabs to the matter should also press Hamas and Fatah to join them.
This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a category of state in the United Nations.
Mr Obama has also a important role in bringing Israel to the negotiation table.
His first mandate offered his own plan for peace.
Again in the White House, it seems like resentment to dedicate your attention to you.
This is a deplorable vision of the future.
A sustainable Middle East is of vital interest for the United States.
This involves a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The General Tobacco Package Act enters into force
Warnings on the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light on a green remote, which are the same for all tobacco marks
The Australian law on tobacco and generally packaging, pine in the world, enters into force and replaces the logos and colors of the marks by an envelope of a green exhaust, a worst image of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and children for being children of smoking parents.
In addition to the different images and warnings of the sane, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since the Sabbath, is the names of the marks, all of them printed in a small source.
It is the strictest system of the world applied to the packaging of tobacco.
The Federal Government is that the goal is to disobey young people to smoke by eliminating the races that make this habit glamour.
I trust in studies that show that if a person hasn't started smoking before 26 years, there is 99% of the possibilities that he will never do it.
"It can be seen that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is selling to its mark," said the Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies showing, for example, how the girls associated with the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Despite having regard to one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and that these changes will not affect too much the benefits of the multinationals, other countries are considering to take similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exercised a huge pressure against law.
Tobacco enterprises have made it possible that the law would promote the black tobacco market, in which cigarettes would be more beautiful and more dangerous.
"The legislation will cause serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre, from British American Tobacco in ↓a.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that China and Indonesia will bring to sale in the streets.
Others say that their business has been benefited after the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, suggested that the request for silicone pillars and ́s pillars to hit the unappreciable images of the chats were almost shot from zero two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco had lost a rejection of the law in the Supreme Court of Justice.
Mrs. Ms. said Zico had sold up to 6.000 units to majorist institutions and was expecting more existence.
"For us is a good business."
Experts are, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is governed.
Following a series of Australian laws that prohibit publicity in television and sport patrocinium and which require the majority of sellers not to put cigarettes in view, the marketing of tabak has passed online.
It has made publicity on the Internet to local companies and websites, but it cannot be limited to foreign pages.
"If you market tobacco and just stay this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most convinced place where you are," said Becky Freeman, research of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in comments on marks resulting from "poot citizens" published on social network pages such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
You should ask if it is just a private citizen who really loves the Marlboro cigarettes and has been taken into disturbance to perform a video or if any marketing company is behind it.
British American Tobacco showed that the industry is more focused on what the new legislation involves than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ucraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new standards; these countries are in front of the World Trade Organization that is injustly restricting trade, although no of these countries have a significant trade volume with .
The WTO has a middle 2013 resolution.
Plibersek suggested that the Government had held conversations with other countries that are considered to apply similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country that introduced the obligation to include images in the cackets.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considered to apply harder laws.
In it, many smokers show challenges.
"The graphs do not affect me.
I just don't care for them."
"Tell the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.
"Really, there is only one reason I would stop smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, indicates that uniform boxes make it more complicated to put them in the stationers.
"Normally it was a hour to draw up a delivery; now late four," Yu.
"The government should have completed the tobacco and then, well, it's finished and we've closed the tent," he says when he arose his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it isn't so bad to get a little deceived
I had to spy five hours in a port because the plane in which we were flying suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had a lot of time to think about abusiveness.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Middle day on a port waiting for a flight to come is pretty disturbable, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without witnessing us from the duty-free tents.
But every time there are more academics and children's development experts than the goods of abusiveness.
If they are, it's good that, both we and our children, we've been disappointed from time to time.
Aburri se forces the brain to seek interesting options and may promote creativeness.
Since the majority of us are now connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits that result in disgrace.
So, should we be courageous to accept disgrace?
Yeah.
And not.
But we'll talk about it forward.
First of all, as many people, it was supposed that, now that we have more time for the oxy, disbursement would be a recent phenomenon.
But as Peter Toohey, Cathedral of the Greek and Roman History of the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The abortion, an animated story") published in 2011 by Yale日 Press, is not so.
"In fact, the story of disappointment is very much,"
In Pompeya's walls, there are latin graphfites on the walls of the I century D.C.
We should also ask ourselves how we definitely define the disgracement.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in very different ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing the published investigations and putting the idea in front of a group of discussions formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the disappointment as the experience of "needing, but not able, to participate in an activity that is filled with you".
It feels that the difference between disturbance and apathy is that the person doesn't do anything but wants to do it.
Remark that there is no desire to do something with the apathy.
The main experience of disappointment is "the change of the attention process, associated with a low state of encouragement and a sense of that the time is slow."
Abortion can sound terriblely like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, even though they can be related, those who are aborted tend to view the problem as an issue of the environment or the world, while those who are depressed consider that the problem is theirs.
Sometimes we believe that we are disappointed, when what happens to us is that we have problems to focus on ourselves.
In its study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September eSeptember of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were sent to an earlier experiment where the participants listened to a circle of a person who read the article of a magazine.
Some groups listened to a television program in the contiguous room that was not holding any relationship, others listened to it with the low volume, so it was only perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group who listened to the programme with the volume below showed more disturbance than the other two groups; they were costed to concentrate, but they were not sure why, and they assigned it to the disgracement.
"When you focus on a difficult or interesting task, the change of attention can lead to disturbance," Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neurocity at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something ugly, like detecting defective parts in a line of manufacturing, a music that distractions you can help you not be disgraced."
"In fact, we now know that moving or making garabates, actions that often are interpreted as a sign of disturbance, can actually help fight it, because they make that person physically more warner."
"The research shows that those children to whom they are allowed to be moved are more and receive more information than those to whom they are forced to be quiet," Professor Fenske.
We all know what it is to be deceived at some time: the delay of a plane, a monotonic speaker, a particularly disgusting movie.
But some people have more trends to be disappointed than others.
To help meet it, some researchers developed a "thinking scale to disturbance" in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions such as "much of the things I have to do are repeated and monotons" and "There are so many things that I am interested that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, which, using these scales, researchers have desired that boys have more tendence to get more frequency than girls, and specifically need more external and more different stimulation.
But in general, teenagers are a kind of group that gets very easy.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and Community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in contact with 400 teenagers and his parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He discovered that 32 percent of the teenagers said he would be disappointed while he was at school or did the debts, while 23 percent said he would be disappointed when he was not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they would be disappointed.
Professor Larson said that he didn't know whether the current degree of deterioration, 21 years later, would be higher or less.
But he said that what he knew was that "adultance is a period in which abortion reaches its highest coins", mostly because both children and adolescents are not given a great control on what they want to do.
So, returning to my question of the beginning: is it good to get abused?
Sometimes it is not, because, leading to the extreme, we can make us exposure to absurd physical risks, such as putting up or falling in the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as shown by research.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak about the connection between abortion and creativity, Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"The disgrace is the way the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what's the best.
If you're crazy and use that energy to touch the guitar or kitchen, it'll satisfy you.
But if you see the television, you may be satisfied for a short time, but not for a long time.
"So, if your son is worried and gives him a iPad, it's likely that he doesn't breathe anymore, but he won't have to enter into himself or to do it," Professor Fenske.
And "this dose capacity is applied to other events," he notes.
Your son doesn't just care for himself, but he's better controlling himself in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise the disgrace.
But we shouldn't be too critical with him.
Our objective should be, rather, to feel comfortable apartments of the constant voice of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way of seeing, we need to worry more, but the disappointment is a too anxious and anxious desire to relate to something that deserves the penalty."
It indicates that what people really seek is a way to devote and enjoy a dead time.
"In a environment in which we are constantly overestimated," -- it's difficult to find ways to focus on our attention when the noise stops.
Colored: no book of instructions for the new law on marihuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student in a Community institution and a footballist in south-east of Colorado, is held to a criminal process for something that will soon be legal in all the state: the possession of some rocks of marihuana and a pipa used to smoke it.
Orrozco says that on September, he and some friends were driven by Lamar, near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marihuana in the car and a while after Orozco received a legal quota for drugs and related articles (small crimes that each one carry a 100-dollar and ́s) in which it was informed of the date of judgment.
"They treat us as criminals," says Orozco.
And are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado for legalization of small marihuana tension for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor causes for drug tension depends less than the law of the location.
Hundreds of smaller crimes by marihuana property are cancelling both here and in Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have ceased to submit charges against the older than 21 years by small in possession, which will be legally approved once the law has entered into force in the next weeks.
But the most conservative taxors of Colorado have committed themselves to continue with cases opened by marihuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the West Mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of houses of marihuana, recently authorised in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, police head in Aurora, right east of Denver.
Those responsible for regulations in the state of Washington are also devoted to the matter.
And they are still looking for advice to establish a system of licences for production, production, distribution and sales; all of this before the date is reached on 1 December 2013.
They say, for good or bad, Colorado goes in front of most states regarding the regulation of marihuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," ○ Brian E.
But Mr. Ëttith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what it could work.
"There's no real thing that serves us as a model."
The Law of Washington, I-502, enters into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which two waters will be born, since the licence system in that state will not exist yet, but the possession will be legal.
Furthermore, there are some delegated mechanical issues that should be resolved during that period, such as the way to maintain a balance between the need of the state to offer a "adequate access" to the authorised marihuana and to carry out cannabis businesses in a radio less than 300 meters of schools, parks, infant game areas or infantial centres.
"Nowhere will be more difficult to locate a authorised cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, a recent research group.
On 21 November, Oates, the police officer of Aurora, sent a mail to his police officers in informing them that the city taxor would stop to interfere with judicial acts for light missing of marihuana to persons older than 21 years of age and that the police would stop submitting charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".
The police officer Oates said that they would be responsible for compliance with the town's legislation regulating marihuana culture for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to persecute traffickers and drug sellers.
In Weld's condeal, north of Colorado, the officer, Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue cases of marihuana possession, mainly to press consumers and to be decided to be treated.
Currently, 119 people are charged by 56 grams or less marihuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has the obligation to interfere with judicial action against the failures that were crimes at the time they had occurred," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places such as the rural court of the Board, where the voters have initiated the initiative on the legalization of marihuana.
Grand Junction Police, the largest city of the condeal, has no longer cited adults in possession of small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, charger of the sentence, supported this decision, but also decided not to disapproval any of the cases of possession.
"I don't think it's losing time while keeping doing the law until this change," he advised.
Although 55 per cent of the voters supported the measure, the marihuana consumption was never considered to be easier for recreational use of the Government and the judicial system.
Contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence between officers in respect of the great experiment of the Officers in this state.
"It is a cultural barrier with the fiscals of the ́t," Sean McAllister, a lawyer of Denver, representing the accused of marihuana and which is a local portfolio of the National Organization for the Reform of the Marihuana Law.
"They have long been taking people before the courts that, in fact, they cannot accept that it is legal," he acknowledged.
As the first states that consider the small quantities of marihuana in the same way as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are prepared to become test cases at national level in relation to drug legalization.
While state lawyers and officers have a new legal sales border, they also expect anxious to receive indications from the Federal Government, which still predict the consideration of the sale and the cultivation of marihuana as federal crimes.
Defensors of the legalization of marihuana hope that the Department of Justice will come.
Although some highlighted arrests of patients and marihuana sellers for therapeutic purposes have been made, the Federal Government has allowed in its majority to exist marihuana sales business for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"Although the anti-drogue agents do not draw gates down to confiscat a small drug bottle, there will probably be reactions to enable the functioning of tents regulated by the state for marihuana for recreational use, allowed in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an anti-drogue policy exaseor of the administration of Obama.
Some towns of Colorado do not expect the federal authorities to act.
Even before the day of the elections, some local governments adopted moratorys on any new house of marihuana, although it will pass about a year before any of them could open.
Last week, the Western city of Montrose adopted a six-month period and it is to accept it the next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation in which we authorize someone and then have a serious federal problem," explained Bob Nicholson, member of the meeting.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying for what the community has voted before voting for what the state has voted."
There are many questions about it.
Petronella Wyatt: "They've got me to get out of Oxford for being a Tory."
The universities are not attacked by their viewpoints only now
I don't remember any moment in my life when I haven't dreamed to get a place at Oxford University.
My father and my older brother had been in which I assumed was the best place of the world to ́er, a Greek simposium of the contemporary era that promoted the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, in the two weeks of occupation of my place at the Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to curse the historic career, I had already done the males, which designed the first scandal of my life.
My father was broken and he was crying.
My friends were unconcerned.
The Evening Standard magazine suggested that I had abandoned because I didn't tolerate that some university companions had sexual relations in the nearby room.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced that he had gone because they forced me to drink in uncovered cups.
The truth was less funny.
Get out of there.
Yes, I fled, because I was subject to an accommodation systematic and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was stuck for one reason, that in the cube of the illustration was something intolerant and barbarous: my father, the dead Woodrow Wyatt, was a highlighted adviser of Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what it comes to now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of students from centre is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutional and growing hatred to the students of the Conservative Party is in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights as homosexual, discapacitated and ethnic minorities.
Conserving members of the JCR (great student grouping) of the Corpus Christi College that are often "seriously apart, personally attacked and treated as ungrateful people" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position in the Equality Committee of opportunities of their college to ensure that they can express their opinions freely.
Its situation was not favoured by a recent documental of the BBC2 called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Paradise: Young, ," ," ," ," and of ́s) on the policy of students and presented to the Tories as excentric and neonazis.
He showed the post-grade student Joe Cooke, president of the Association of Oxford University Conservative (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, with a silver cargo and a baston with the silver pump.
At other universities, conservators say that they are treated as "Turkey heads" by the introduction of higher matrix rates.
Luke Black, 20-year-old and chairman of the Conservative Party's Association of the Nottingham University, declared in a dominical magazine that " there is a growing trend of links at universities.
People assume we are like the Bullingdon Club without even if he met us."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old historian student in Corpus Christi who presented the invitation to a greater protection, that this environment is "incomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old and president-elected by the OUCA, has deteriorated that the members of the JCR towards those who are from center.
"This is a threat to the intellectual debate environment and to the welfare of the members."
My first weeks in Oxford were more alone than one.
I entered the university in September 1986, a 18-year-old youth.
The hatred to the Conservator Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse Margaret Thatcher, former student, a title "honoris cause" after the scores in the financing of the Superior Education.
The environment would have caused any stalinists to be terrified.
For the first days of the week of welcome to the new universities, when the new students were known and known to the Cathedrals, I received a sample of the bitterness I expected.
I discovered that the Cathedrals did not just make the fat view of the mof that was made of the conservative universities, but that they participated in it with a good gain.
The Minor's Wood Policy, Privacy and Government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the tree rooms of the seminar.
The first attendant had to be translated to the French text of the 18th century and I was not prepared for the following.
"Lord Wyatt," said Catedric Harry Pitt, " Please translate the first paragraph."
I don't know anybody.
Pitt, a man low with a face that seemed to be a mass of bizcock, knew well how to eject bad balls.
"Is it that the thatcherists deny French or are they just stupid?" asked he.
The other universities were ridiculous.
I was burning the eyes of the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you to go to French classs in your free time, always and when I'm not too busy knowing people," Pitt grudged.
I rejoiced in my room as a penny soul.
That night I was alone at the dinner hour at the university, and then I felt a light palmed at the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who was presented as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," said I.
"I'm afraid that's how the thing goes.
They're met with anyone who's suspecting to be Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but they know that your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be worse for you.
Many Tories recently arrived to appear as workers."
Before, in a local pub, I tried to dissimulate coolly.
I insisted that I was not in agreement with all that Mrs. Thatcher said.
That truck was unusual.
A first-year-old student of Philosophia, Politicals and Economy who had paradoxly studied in Eton said, "You are a daughter of a fascist herd.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the perverted Swiss.
"How do the Tories have sexual relations?" asked one.
"They're giving one to another, don't you?"
I felt in the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 60s.
Could you ever take a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me just after evening?
Would you have to make me worker and repress my natural trends?
The three years I was expected were presented as a cleaning of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Cathedral Tory was Norman Stone, Contemporary History Professor, designed to my university college.
They hated him because he was not only the Conservator party but also Thatcher's adviser in external policy and one of the people who wrote his speech to him.
I was just there.
He hated the place that he considered it provinciously and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxista-determinist vision of the history.
In 1997, he accepted a chair at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I started to move from Oxford daily to my parents' home in London, finding me in my family and friends of the most open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father to hate Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 40s, all political points were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he sadly said.
"They would never do that, not there between my dear kidneys.
Even my communist friends have always had an impecable."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they've done it just to worry.
My heart would be divided if you left it."
With so many travels to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
One of my friends, who also supported the Conservator Party, had undergone pressure and had refused to believe.
The next week, during a seminar in which another Cathedral of History had insinuated, speaking totally seriously, that I was a "neem of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red to see inside, I admitted that my parents had "smocked my brain" and I called them "sound ways".
The tragedy took a little time.
It was my father who put the last key on my university career at Oxford.
That was why my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch's pressure.
My door was closed with key.
I was inside of fear and, for five minutes, my owners left.
When they went, I took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak lloron.
But no 18-year-old person should be subject to such intimidation and hostility in a educational institution.
What is more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 first ministers of the Conservator party but, today, is hidden after a reputation of nothing deserved of equality and freedom of thinking.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notority"
Because of the sample "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which has been incurred this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer clients
Somerset House, ancient residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of receiving an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", a retrospective apoteotic that gathers over 130 high-cost clothes created by his "maison" during the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his inconfundable Italian accent.
This sample is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "Lord" Garavani, but that could not have been written without its different customers.
Valentino always feels fascinated by the enraged and remote world of nobleness.
In the first room of this exhibition, open to the next 3 March, they browse private letters and photos with the signature of the most granate of the aristocracy, from Princesa Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passed by the Princesa Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino refers to these personal memories as trophes of its social ascension: humble modesty of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international "jet-set".
Love for reality has nothing wrong.
"They at least don't cut off their pillars on your wonderful hole as they make some beautiful celebrations of pop music," says Baronesa Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alpes and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular engineering and maintains generosity and elegance.
"All of us were pleased to be invited to your chalet in Gstaad," explains the exhesion of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of beauty as Marella Agèi the Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance to notority.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, lighting a Valentino
The argentin model Valeria Mazza also doesn't live the charism of the modist.
A few years ago, after a defil in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we flew to dinner at his feet.
We were twenty people, among whom Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, all was seen and feeling his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top model", which comes to work with him during the High Costure Week of Paris in 1995.
"Nothing happens in moda because your designs are art works," finished.
Alcurnia Disabled
Garavani's life is not a story of employment, but of well-compatible love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House gallerys has been transformed into a 60-metres long passport passport that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must scroll through the passport to look at a "audit" of enthusiasm that lights the works of Valentino teachers, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristoteles Onassis, the clothing that uses Monica Vitti in "La Night", or a cover of lana and skin that belonged to the Empiretriz Farah Diba.
The names such as the Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn and Taxi, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg are included in that public of maniquies.
Naty Abascal and the modist, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, " impossible to live."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a button, a camisa, a "gillette" chat and a jacket of the 1971-1972 ottone winter collection.
"It was a gift he made me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muscles.
"I prefer him above others for his femaleness, for his great love for women, because he highlights our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors that use, have great light and are "donants" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and prescriptive of moda Patricia della Joovapaola d'Arenbergtampoco can be the first time he saw a Valentino.
When he was teenager and lived in Italy, he dreamed to have the age and opportunity to be able to use one of his night traces...
Finally, the time arrived at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first clothes of Valentino to use at a party at my grandmother's chamber, Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a red tragedy, with a floor of flights, "corsage" drapped and listened to the word of honor.
"It was a real dream," says Rodrigo's widow of Arenberg.
"Valentino is independent of the mode, its existence is the attemporary," explains this Italian aristocrate that lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps his feast clothes with "the most careful... because a clothes is not just a clothes, it is also the set of memories that he takes."
The "key" of the mode
The great end of the exhibition of Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's girlfriend at his wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
Four months of work was needed and 25 "raga" (as called the modist to their corners) to prepare that marphile seed trace with perles incrossing, twelve different types of incage and a four-medium school.
The journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized pressure, which clothing represents a hito of the high costure of the end of the 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obnubilated for years with the "saver-being" of the elite, now Valentino is his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rango distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Work, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Letres, decorated with the Honor Legion, Garavani collects so many honors as any of his customers' husbands.
"You always call me attention to your refining, your calm, your pulch and perfect aspect," admits D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw it was a month ago at a galla dinner in the Orsay Museum.
He was on the table of Ribes Jacqueline, my great friend.
"It was impecable, it wasn't time for him."
If a princess says that...
The worst office of the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers are playing life and health by loading 70 kg sugar to stone senders
There are people for whom your work is a helmet and another one that literally works in the helmet.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who win life by taking sugar from the Kawah Ijen volcan, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For that, it must be down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphurous gas that educates from the entrances of the Earth is strengthened when it comes into contact with the air.
After dragging big sugar rocks, which at all reach about 70 kilograms, they carry them in two bamboo boxes loading on their backs to ≥ sendered rocks.
They are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which is up to 2.386 metres of height, but the exhaust porters are late over 40 minutes to go up to the torture pass, keeping the balance and measureing their steps with tent to not be packed and falling through the precipicium.
They know that any transpition could cost them life, as happened to a French tourist who was dismissed for the risks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen Miners win 5 centimeters of euros for each kilogram of sugar that extracts
Once above, a step is opened between the tourists who graphize them as if they were cycle monos and, laying the heavy canasts hardly, walks three kilometers to the balance that a mineral company has made a little lower, at 1.850 meters of the height.
It is PT Candi Ngrimb, a company exploiting the volcan since 1960 and, never better said to his employers, who pays 662 Indonesian rupes (5 centimeters of euro) for each kilogram of sugar.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupias (83 centimeters of euros) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is generalized in the daily life and is used to produce circles, artificial fires, cosmetics, dinamites and even to black sugar.
"As normal is to load 70 kg, we take about 46,000 rupias (3,8 euros) on each travel," explains Anto, who frequently performs three daily doors.
There's three hours in each and it's finished, but it allows you to join 138.000 rupias (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a weakness for such inhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would win in the field.
"The miners' journal is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid to 15.000 rupias (1.2 euros) on the day and the average payment is of two million rupias (167 euros) ", states the carrier, who was earlier working as albanil on the Bali tourist island.
There, his floor was 75.000 rupias (6.2 euros) on the day and the tattoo was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a people near the volcano, for a weight reason that, in Indonesia, is so constant as the sugar: "I married a young Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I brought it to Java to become the Islam."
Then he has asma, breathe with difficulty, tose constantly, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At its 27s, Anto carries three jugs in the Kawah Ijen, whose sugar has already started to pass the facture, despite covering his face with a special mask and walls.
He has asma, breathe with difficulty, tose constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that exhaust the volcan.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I'll work two years more because I want to open a tent or study Spanish or French," it promises in a more acceptable English than acceptable English.
Castigated by life, this beautiful and intelligent young man could be tourist guide, a car or a receptionist of a hotel, but instead does the work of a mule.
Sharing a unclean wood cab with other carriers, it rises every day at the two of the morning because the sugar doesn't stop moving the night, when its yellow color is returned to the middle of the darkness.
In defiance of the shadows, then low down to the crater with a small linterna attached to his cask, which he himself has bought with his money.
Approximately 400 carriers load sugar boxes on their necks from the bottom of the crater
Despite its benefits, the mineral company has not mechanized the extraction of the sugar to cover costs or provide any equipment to the carriers who work for their account and the weight.
In fact, not if you see part of the 30,000 rupias (2.5 euros) by camera recharge that, at the input of 15,000 rupias (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park cover tourists coming to photograph the volcan and their human mules.
"This work is for animals and not for people," protests Madrisin, a 42-year-old carrier in Kawah Ijen three deths since the college left.
You can lift up up to 110 kg, make sure you will endure working "all that you can" because you need money to educate your three children from 18 to 10 years.
I'm not gonna jubilate, I'm gonna die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sugar burns the garment and listens to the eyes when the wind changes of improvization and catches mineres in the spending columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one is complained of suffering serious diseases... outside, it is, of its usual respiratory problems, artrosis, pains in the knees and beds in the backs, which have been malformed by the weight of the boxes.
By balanceing the canastal on your back, Unainik can only load 50 kg at its 53 years.
Each day, he and his companions drag 15 tons of sugar to the volcan, which three trucks transfer to the stock of Tamansari, 18 kilometers away from a way of goats between the male.
"I will not jubel, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Uninik declares well opening his mouth, where he misses several teeth.
Of his five children, the elder of 30 years, also works carrying sugar.
The time passes, but the everlasting affliction of generation in generation is one of the most hard offices of the world: who makes the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore searches for children to save the economy
Singapores are guilty of career, stress and cost of properties and education because they have no children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, we comply with our civil duty and we believe life!
It may seem inverosimal that these verses are part of an announcement of menta palettes, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral in YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "We'll put a bao (black) in the horn" to laugh at Singapore's birthday rate.
The publicity company who made the video, BBH, is the hope that with the announcement they can call attention on the problem in a funny way.
Your creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill with "their national duty".
This is something clean from the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world in reproducing ourselves, so we felt that this was a subject that we had to face.
We knew that the government had made many things, such as launching perfumes with feromons or organizing rapid citations (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do the most creatively possible to solve this problem, which is composing a rap?
1.2 children
What doesn't take it so easy is the government of Singapore.
US$300 per year in policy to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, extends licences for maternity and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-technological city in Southeast Asia, also known by the conservation of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national division of population, is currently situated in 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 - known as reposition rate - was in 1976.
So why do the Singapores no longer have children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage Policy and Family of the National Division of Population, says that it is due to a "better education" and "a larger range of career opportunities".
"It has allowed people to have a wide range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities, beyond marrying and forming a family," explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in solemnity, and to delay marriage and birth, which results in decreasing the rate of birth in Singapore.
Meanwhile, a immigration policy points to drastic increase in immigration in order to deal with the decrease of the population has created a feeling between the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites where xenophobia only grows disfraced against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, to whom they criticize to maintain low salaries and not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapore government party experienced its worst electoral result from independence.
Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and records for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall of birth rate has known effects on the economic growth of a nation, tax income, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore has some unexpected consequences.
The government does not build such small houses.
For example, it began to affect the immobile sector.
The urban development authority has passed to control the number of small apartments, known as the "boat box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is anxiety that they can promote a lifestyle of singleness and disappoint developers who want to build large, family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Immobiliary Company EL ↓ers, says that his "shop boxes" are selling much more faster than the largest units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units are exposed to days, even weeks, faster than greater units.
This makes it better for our box flow.
However, it admits that the new standards provide clearer guidelines for developers, which were previously put to work if they wanted to offer too small units in a project.
Too Stressed
Singapore is a city of State.
Although these new rules may be a step towards the increase in national birth rate, talking to the Singapores who work at the financial rate of the centre seems to have a lot of effect.
"The people are very stressed, the houses are faces, and it is also education, so many people are putting it up," says a young executive.
Others can have children.
"But it is important for me to count with my own money and time," says another 20-year-old young man.
Men and women mention their career, stress and costs of properties and education, such as the reasons for which they do not have children.
Thus, because the government tries to empowere his citizens to have children, when it is to make children, the Singapores are those who have the last word.
Private offline is private on line
Privacy.
In accordance with the Dictionary of the Royal A° Spanish, it is the quality of private or "the area of private life which is entitled to protect from any intromission".
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply to its daily life and social networks?
Do you understand the dangers that are exposed to ventilation on the Internet which would certainly not be offline?
the Journal interviewed five boys of ten to 15 years of age, often network users.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with " something very my" in personal manner, and "in the key and user's name", when it was applied to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not go up to a post," says Jorge, 10 years old when she explains the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where she has been accounting for two years ago.
"They're very secret secrets, my mother can meet them, but not everyone."
In FB I get beautiful or game images.
I'm also interested in my friends.
"I wouldn't have a photo that's not mine, or someone who's doing the ridiculous," he says.
The kid recognizes that it is bad to publish obscene graphs, naked people, crimines, or to write comments that are humiliating or violent.
Jorge makes sure you know the 35 friends you have on the FBI and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother is included, he has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express me and write interesting Twitters.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'll just get them up," adds.
"Social networks are entertained, I can talk to remote parents or to my friends quickly," it says.
There is no doubt to answer that I would never accept a request of an unknown person.
I wouldn't take care of someone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask in this last admit to do not know 20 of the people added in his list of friends.
"Don't me, because we have something common, for example music," says.
The boy, no one has instructed him or has asked him the address of his house or phone number.
"If they pressed me or would simply take it from my account," he admits.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, then reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy isn't just the experiences of what today is known as ciberbullying.
One of my friends was extortioning him in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded him money.
"I never knew who he was," she assured.
The victim, Joseph, didn't close the account.
"Only placed privacy to you."
Then explain a series of steps to configure the account safely.
The difference in Jorge, this boy would take up photos of famous or pregnant people.
Yeah, I would, if I'd fall wrong or I'd get you.
"Although I know that it's ciberbullying."
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English and licensed in Education and Learning, considers that in order to guide children and adolescents, it should be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"Internet appeared as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," it states.
Porras notes that the Academic Mark Prensky, master in Pedagogia by the Yale University and author of the Digital Native and Immigrant Work, accused these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital nationals are they, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them when we are still doing it," he says.
It comments that the theme has been completed, "for we ask you to have a definite criteria on what it should be or not spread, publish or say to an age that the matureness does not give for it."
"And they are selective when the most important thing they care is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," adds.
The most efficient way of teaching the privacy for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them that I don't do it doesn't serve," adds.
Then, Porras mentioned some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to make a photo of you like that you published of a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
When you tag photos of holidays, have you requested the other people permission to label them?
And one more, everyone needs to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to show you that you must act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"One outside of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, must be equal in social networks."
Vigilance
Stuardo Guardia, university cathedric, primary teacher and educational adviser, comments that it is essential that family parents read aware of social network policies.
In understanding each of the incisions they have strong foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening a account on the Internet.
"For example, the age and what is allowed or published," he says.
According to the Guardian, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "no talking with strangers".
Finish the Unasur summary without publicing the Lima Declaration
The VI Presidency summary of the South American Union (Unasur) has concluded today in Peru without publicing the Lima Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically subscribed by the seven assistant mandaters.
Efe tried to repeat opportunities— the document signed in the VI Orderary Meeting of the Government of the States and Government of the United States, but the sources of Cancilleria and Presidency signed at a beginning that it would be delivered after the clause, but then they said that it would be published at some time on the Peru Government's website.
In consultation with the text, they noted that the content had been expressed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a few short statements at the press.
The access of journalists to the summary information was limited at any time.
The day was only transmitted in the press room the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The few information he had among the reporters was delivered by the press portfolio of some of the United Sur governments to the meeting, although not the Peruian.
The only document published during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists of various national and international media to request greater data.
Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summary, but it was the statement of Humala, not the official document that closed the summary.
In October past, Peru was the employee of the Third Country of South America (ASPA), and at that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the also called Lima Declaration that had previously been announced.
In the ASPA's official website, the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international citations, the Peru authorities strived to make sure transmission systems for all journalists but limited the information.
The summary also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a failure from the Court of Haya that leads a different frontier between both countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Pinnera, gathered during the regional meeting and held that they would respect the decision of the (CIJ), starting on Monday in Haya to listen to both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will take and execute the sentence that defines the differences we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said, along with its Chilean couple.
"Chile has been, it is, and will continue to be a respectful country of international law, peaceful solution to conflicts, treaties and international courts," Pinnera advised and welcomed Humala with a hand pressure, with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that they would be subject to the CIA occurred after that week Colombia declared that Bogotá had accepted the failures of that international court, and then a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that considered seriously wrong.
The summary was performed with the inassistance of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the destitution of his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Ollanta Humala was the responsibility of opening the debates in the morning and closing the summary shortly after Lima's midnight.
The mandate read the final document in which it informed that 16 agreements were adopted and the action lines were fixed for 31 projects between South America countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investment.
Among the adopted agreements he mentioned that UNASUR countries would give " important steps towards the purpose of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residence agreements".
He informed that action is encouraged to improve "the cooperation in combating civil insecurity and the transnational organized crime, action to make drugs more eligible, Internet access to prices in all South America rivers, and to focus on the risks of natural disasters together."
With a crisis Europe, "the economic consolidation (latin America) should not have a triunphalist matrix but should be used to expand our productive matrix and to make a better future for our people," Humala advised.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblem projects that will improve the connection of South America spaces, especially in rural and border areas, joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," Peru's President said in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transversal axes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country serves for its re-corporation to the Union of South America", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relationships between neighbors was one of the issues underlined by the summary.
In this regard, President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before he started his participation in the regional meeting that he expected to meet with his couple of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the Sabbath in Mexico to treat the different maritime after a fall of the CIA, questioned by Bogotá.
"The morning (Saturday) may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"We'll review all these ways, they're not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope with President Ortega I can tell you that we have managed this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would be found on the Sabbath in Mexico, where they had planned to attend the mandate to the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, as part of the summary, the Defence Ministers of the Block had previously meet to adopt the Action Plan of 2013, seeking to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on Defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the presidency for the temperature of the regional block.
"Suramerica must have Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, stated today that the creation of a common citizenship is a objective in which "Suramerica, in this case, should be of Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summer of the South American Nations Union (Unasur), celebrated in Lima, declared to the Peru TV state that the Europeans were killed in the Second World War and in other conflicts, "but now they are almost a country."
In this regard, he defended the project to establish the South American citizenship that encourages the United States Member States.
"The free mobility of citizens and workers for any South American country, as it is already happening to the integrants of the Andina Community, but there are still re-even sectors that want us to be in the past," he warned.
The Equatorian Chairman also showed the recomposition of the United States Organization (OEA) under the premium to decrease the influence of the Anglossian States and to take into account those signed by the San José Agreement on Human Rights.
Those who give a chair never commit themselves to anything and, instead, the South Americans sign it all.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Committee on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," he advised in an allusion to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he is not repentant of that decision because he has not betrayed its principles but has respected his "deep democratic and human rights values".
He agreed that at his time, "There were suspicions based that Assange was extradited to a third country and did not respect its process."
Furthermore, he criticized Swedish justice for submitting to the interview in its territory for a presumptuous sexual crime when "the Swedish legislation allows it to be carried out through video conference, which could be done from the Ecuador embassy in London".
Correa acknowledged that there is the risk that the physical and mental health of Assange is deteriorated.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our ambassador, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," Equatorian mandatary said.
What is right is the danger that your physical and mental health is deteriorated by being closed in a small space without being able to exercise free air.
"It complicates the health of any person," he advised.
Correa noted that the solution to Assange at the equatorian ambassador in London since June, through the concession of a safe conduct that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities, and stressed that he had conversations with London seeking a solution to the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word we do not use it in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is making a series of procedures at different European institutions," he mentioned.
And he thought, "If Great Britain gives tomorrow the safe conduct this ends."
And if Sweden, as it is perfectly allowed by its legislation and in other cases, ask Mr. Assange at the Ecuador ambassador in London or ask him by Skype tomorrow, this problem ends.
Correa used to restore himself as a defensor of the freedom of pressure and death that what doesn't tolerate is "the media, the wicked faith and the lie, which distort freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of the freedom of press are not the wicked and wicked politicians, but the bad journalists depending on profit, changing and extortion," he said.
In this regard, it was welcomed that these journalists were no longer "not the bankers or the Hegemonic and Burguese countries dominant Ecuador", and it continued to be reelected "will profondize in the revolution to continue the path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the Veto in Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body " must be firm and not tolerate the opportunity and golpism of legality" because "the legitimateness of the paraguay democracy".
The Equatorian Chairman also considered the "perfectly relevant" desire of his Colombian homolog Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime limits between both countries after the failure of the International Court of Justice of La Haya, which benefited from the marine sovereignty of Nicara's.
It's not the case for the moment.
It's a problem between a South America and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will of walking together.
You have to process them in a wide way to overcome them and continue.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the dispute for maritime limits held in the same court of Peru and Chile and said that "is right for Latin America to seek international institutions if both countries are committed to accept failure as hard as possible."
With regard to the possibility of candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consequent mandate, he pointed out that the possibility is "with a lot of optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes quite hard."
Corree assured that if he lost the February 2013 committees, he will be removed from the public life.
I have never been interested in the staff, but injustices as the Ecuador's, such socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed that victory because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
To win is my last period in the presidency and we're out of the public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he advised.
Correa also refers to the new health treatment of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just talked to the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and told me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, of routine, that was expected to take place the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a recycling in the health status of President Chavez," he commented.
Head of Equatorian State has today participated in Lima at the Fifth Summary of Governments of the State and Government of the United States of South America (Unasur), which has concluded with calls for a greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Dead for Side today are causes of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when confirmed the result of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was as if a bomb was falling to me," refers to remembering the time of the announcement, that the doctor was making "moother," without clear success.
The boy hid it to his family.
She decided to be charged only for her disease and come to be informed about it; with such an effort that she had already celebrated her birthday 43.
It is, of course, one of the oldest patients from the Guadalajara Civil Hospital Unit (HCG), to which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (VIH) since 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of 90, when there were many doubts, few options of treatment and more stegma.
So, even the manager of an IMSS clinic avoided to get away from him "for he brought a cut."
So SIDA was a sinonymous of death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and make it with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already caused traces, "took" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the world’s AIDS appearance, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this point means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely way and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," indicated by Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HCG VIH Unit, after referring that this information was assessed in April this year in a citizenly prestigiated publication.
Infectionologist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life of impact on the immune system presenting patients at the start of diagnosis, with a better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a number of 200 CD4 and 50 years when reporting 500 CD4.
In simple words, the preceding means that whoever receives the positive HIV diagnosis at the age of 25, under these terms "within control, he can live without problems until the 75 years", explained the interview.
To measure this progress, it is necessary to remember that the life hope of the Mexico people today is of 76 years in average.
Although the mortality has been significantly decreased in the last years, in Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS was decreased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 percent of patients in the national database have fallen since the AIDS appearance.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people have fallen in 2011, and 187 deaths have occurred until May this year; however, it is ensured that there is universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
- Why's there still been deaths?
- I think the problem isn't about access to treatment.
This is how visual it is, so it has happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had enough medicine, the problem is that patients are very advanced because they are unknown to their condition of infection, or, in late stages of disease.
God's constant data: "9 of each ten patients are coming when they already present some opportunistic infections that are to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make diagnostics more early and therefore must be offered tests of detection massively, to all people who repeat it."
In its proposal, specialists and officers of the State Aid Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida), too, patients, such as Fabrizio, who came to test a particular responsibility, only motivated because a friend had made it and, despite his short age, was already in a stage of AIDS and even suffered a sarcom of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have a sida.
Some people think they're gonna die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'm better back three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, I'm eating well, I'm exercising, I'm taking the medicines.
On the date, your parents only know that he suffered cancer.
I live a normal life, like anybody.
"Work, I have a lot of activities, travel, I have a active sex life, but I am responsible, I care for me and the other person," Fabrizio, who accepted his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his witness to those who today, in the World Day of Sida, fear.
Let the test be done, if you had a risk, that, between the early, you know whether they are positive HIV, it is better and if they already have diagnostics, that they can live as any person, being responsible.
This, your message, summarizes the battle lemma at the Side this 2012.
Conditions after display
Great are the places between health programmes and the common citizen, Ricardo Salazar, a tapathy journalist who has taken the case in turn to HIV.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condones has been effectively increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us 100 packages, and that is very good, but it results that there are people today, yet, have no access to a condone," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want them?" is common question, with social valuable work, school guides, farmers and health staff, which youths do not want to expose, the communicator assures.
I proposed to reorient this inefficiency distributed; that the condons are not only after the showers and that these hundreds are located in public bathroom sprayers from the sites of young people frequently.
It is not motivating promiscuity.
It is not about paying them the halls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González answered, as he asked if he would have shared preservatives in his life.
"This is not sexuality, it is best to draw close to condones who have already practiced sexual activity," he said.
Family En Jalisco
There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated AIDS cases and 13th of HIV.
92% of the contagios correspond to the sexual way, 6% to the bloodway and 2% to the perinatal.
It is deemed that 50 thousand people can live with HIV because in one case there are 4 to 5 people who don't know it.
Ratified by a United States Appeals Court of Justice a sentence that does not recognize the debt retribution of the Vitro Group achieved by a marketing concurrence in Mexico, the scenario places a neighborhood for any national undertaking with ramifications in the neighborhood country with solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures on signatures allowing mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical field, the expense to the sentence issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankrotes for the North of Texas, allows mexican signatures in defense against the possibility of embarcation of their properties at the distance of the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to join the Supreme Court of the United States, appealing three inconsistences.
Income, while the judge of the case points out that the creditors should be governed by the United States Queebra Act, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, with a seat in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the market competition undertaken in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international processal cooperation in cases of transnational enterprises' intention.
In fact, to this end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of the International Mercantil Right was created, the American Law Institute was colocated as an arbitr.
Secondly, the sentence states that without the vote of intercompetitions, recognised in the critical mass of the marketing competition, the debts of Vitro's branches with their matrix, would not have been achieved the majority required to approve the re.
However, the possibility is recognised by Mexico laws.
In fact, the Vitro was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are a half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexico Commercial, whose intercompetition debts assessed the Federal Institute of Mercantiles Concurrences.
In addition, it is that by remaining the votes of the branches, the Vitro creditors who were fighting against this in the United States Courts, such as "buitre" funds as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, they would not have achieved most.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The date is dismissed by the Court of Appeals.
Since another angle, this is Vitro's fault for the difficult situation that since 2008 has occurred to the serious economic crisis that has taken the United States, takes the collections to the country.
The signature of the González Sada family will soon interfere with a review resource before the court of claims so that the vote reaches the full of this, namely the five judges, because only three voted.
If this is not prosperous, the resource of Cerciorare will be requested to revise the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The serious case is that the court has submitted a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of friends curiae ("friend of the Court"), in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the Law of Mercantiles, indicating that it has been decreased with attachment to the conventions signed by both countries to packaging this with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankrotes Law.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has been addressed to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, namely rules for transbording cases of inevitability, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambola of two sides: Take Vitro and take it into the country.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The baloncesto has been my life"
Trotamunds of Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years connected to the deport of the table circle and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
A few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of the local baloncest as well as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And it is that before a brain breaking limited it to a road hall in 2008, Reyes was in the deport for more than 60 years, he was as a player of smaller categories, player of the National Superior Baloncesto, capable and leader of the BSN with the Bayamons Vaqueros or president of the Baloncesto Federation.
"I placed many shadows in my life's balloon, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, General Director of the National Team and Federative President during the 1990s," Reyes remembered during a first hour visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The baloncest has been my life."
Reyes doesn't exagerate by making that surprise.
The walls of your house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that denote their broad traictory, so they atesty it.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, those who are more emotional are those who remember their step by the Vaquers from the middle of the 50s as player until 1982, when he fulfilled 15 years working as co-powered or approved of franquicity.
"There were my best years, the most I enjoyed because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaquers campaigns since 1967, it was already as a potential, co-powered or leader.
There were many years of satisfaction, including the five campaigns running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I departed with one in 1981, the first year of Jerome Mincy in the BSN.
The "Cuco" Ortiz was charged, which was a great administrator," Reyes indicated.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have you a very strong player of 6"7 stage.
Do you want it?"
And that was the principle of Mincy, one of the best players who had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended the Raymond Gausse francother, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said if Mincy had given him a campaign to Bayamon, Gausse would help bring another.
The Vaqueros campaign with Gausse goes it, but it is already far away, because for 1988 it was already a federal mandama.
For that time, I prefered to enjoy their executions and Mincy's executions in the National Team.
I remember when we first won the United States during the Preolympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then I came to the World of 1990, where we arrived fourth place, and it should have been bronze to be not by that Canadian arbitr who made us repeat the final game for the second time, said Reyes.
Is this world group in 1990 the best national team you have seen?
It's among the best, as he won the Dream Team in the Olimpiades of 2004.
But my favorite was the Panamics in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave him one for the United States team, which was quite similar to those who won the bronze in the world.
That team did not only repeat Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Small" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" and James Carter young, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not have been in the 90th because of a disappointment on the knee.
A team that may not be the best in terms of personal, but gave us a golden medal and a great joy was the of the Preolympic of 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Snows, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner in the substitution of the players suspended by the Panamerican of the Plata Sea, we win gold against all the prognoses.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
No doubt, that was Piculin Ortiz.
Its numbers at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as Piculin did.
And that without counting his traictory in the different lines he played.
Who was the best boyman leader?
That's very hard.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Melléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armmandito Torres.
From young people, I like Leo Arrill's job.
What do you think of your greatest success in the federalization?
It was part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of 1990 BSN had up to 17 teams at a season.
What'd you have to do?
There were things that would have wanted to implement, such as regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, that Ponce's boys were only playing in their area and only holding teams of other island ricons in the national playoffs.
Now children travel and play too unnecessary.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, board officers and arbiters.
That's a pleasure for me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listening to music, see videos of the music of my age in YouTube, enjoying my grandparents and sometimes going to baloncest games.
And of course, enjoying my wife's company, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Dead actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became worldwide aware of his central role as John Ross Ewing, most known as "J.R". in the "Dallas" television series, in which he encountered a man of business without slaves, malicious and manipulator.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the great oil depreciator J.R. Ewing in the "Dallas" TV series became a symbol of avaricy in 1980's decade, is dead.
She was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year like J.R. at a new "Dallas season", died on Wednesday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a communication of the family provided to the Warner Bros., "Dallas".
"Larry was back in her dear Natal city of Dallas, representing again the economic role he liked most," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the festival of the Day of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequele, was with Hagman when she disappeared in a Dallas hospital, said the publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
I was glad for everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, grateful, lovely and talentably, and I will be very surprised.
"He was a original person and lived the life at the maximum," Gray advised in a communication.
Hagman carries hectatic cirrosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drunk for many years.
In 1995, he found a bad tumor in the hiver and was subjected to a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became awesome in the TV as a decent type in the "I Dream of Jeannie", distributed by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In her interpreted Captain Tony Nelson, a astronauta whose life is changed when he finds a attractive genio, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and leads her to live with him to her home.
It was also a protagonist of two comedys that had been short time in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included well received papers in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was its magistrate interpretation of the encouragingly hatable J.R. that led Hagman to his maximum star.
The dramatic series of the CBS string on Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.", thought to generate expectative in turn to a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated a international speculation and millions of dollars risked in appeal houses.
He also helped to give the series a hearing record at that time.
When the answer was discovered in a chapter of November 1980, a average of 41 million televisors synchronized it and became "Dallas" in the second most visible entertainment programme of the history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was J.R.'s cousin, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. the pregnant and then the threat with a prostitute ticket unless it goes out of the city, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insensitive corrupt with a charismatic smile: a trampous businessman and a female husband who tried her alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be internated.
"I know what I want at J.R.'s lap," Hagman said in 1988.
I would say, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiation he lost.
Main Victoria, coprotagonist of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as someone "worm, inside and out of the screen".
It is unforgettable, and unreplaceable, for millions of admirators in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we had the lucky to know him and love him.
Ten episodes of the new and "Dallas" were transmitted a few months ago with great success to the TNT channel.
The five chapters had already been completed for the second season and one sixth was in process, reported the chain.
There was no Warner or TNT statement immediately about how the Hagman loss will handle the series.
Or by Fort Worth, Texas, he was a son of the actriz and song Mary Martin, who starri is classic works such as "South" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had it in 1931 during his marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried happiness in the New York theatre scenarios at the beginning of 1950's decade, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While he was there, he met the young woman design sweden; Axelsson married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrations live.
In 2001 he titled his memories "Hello Darlin': Tall (and absolutely true) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought it would be to hurt someone or affect them anyway," said the Prince Associated at that time.
After higado transplanting, he became a promotor of the donation of organs and worked as voluntary in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them value, I meet with them when they come to their surgery, and then," he indicated in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like "You're not afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they'll be fine."
It was also activist against the habit of smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start the course that explodes the "The end of the world"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and warming, and global heat.
This semester, when the teacher in the religion Stuart Charmé decided to present a course on the end of the world, knew that he had an irresistible age: the end of the "large backward account" of the Maya Calendar on 21 December, which many people have been attracted as a evidence of the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea of what he expected in the following few months: the Ucranian Catholic Sandy, a fiscal precipient that some have called "deudarmageddon" and a growing conflict that involves Israel, the place where Christians teachers at the end of the times believe that the Apocalypse will be started.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester that he had done," Charme said this week to the students of the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If one analyses what has happened in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that it's bad for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on "the end of the world" this half, in theory the last of the history.
In Temple, added teacher Barry Vacker provides the course "Mediums, Culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and warming, and global heat.
"Let us consider why these ideas proliferate with time," he said, and how they offer hypothetic scenarios that guide some human behavior.
If nuclear material falls in the hands of terrorists, for example, it could be a war.
This month, students analysed films with apocalyptic subjects and explored how they were compared to examples of real life.
"I've tried to inform students of what it is possible, it's, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American History Matthew Re and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjoint teacher of Art and Antropology, have made a team to provide a course, entitled only "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count with the option to present the course again, if the world doesn't end," said Re.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final reviews.
In Penn State, the final examination will be taken in the weekend of the Apocalipse, which does not leave students more than to work "to the same night when the world is supposed to be finished", said Re.
The courses were very popular.
"He was satisfied in two hours," said the King about his course for high-medium students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received messages by e-mail for weeks and weeks before the start of the seamestry, from people who asked if there was still happening.
Students, on their own, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I am fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old Carrier Student in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a question of comfort or absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of the psychology and nurse career, said he had seen all the Apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach it," she said.
I enjoy it.
But no interviewed student - and much less a teacher - said to believe on the date of expiry of 21 December.
"Our first project was discussed on Maya prophecy and in a certain way we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, student of the last year in Temple, 21 years old and West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said King.
But he found that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in the west culture, which rises to several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an eye of these speculations.
"In other parts people don't think about this," said he.
Most in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious teacher of the University The Salle that provides courses in the Philippines this year, replied quickly to the question of whether he knew any course about "the end of the world".
"The Philippines don't participate in the end of the world," he wrote, instructing an appointment of a superior authority.
We have a Papa's indulgence.
Re > noted that during the years it has been spoken of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "the people will begin to think immediately on the next date" or to philosopher that on December 21 is the beginning of a period of seven years after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date easily.
Some said they thought to go to "the end of the world" festivals.
"Please call me some friends to laugh together," Samira Ford, 20-year-old community student.
