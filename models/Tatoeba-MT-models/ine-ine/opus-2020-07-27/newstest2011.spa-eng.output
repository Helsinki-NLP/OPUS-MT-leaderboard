What do you think? The CSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the pastel
The new concepts of the CSSD in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, evident language barriers so that the components of the Prague Board and of the municipal Council understand their renewable partners of the ODS.
The period currently.cz "examinated" to the members of the new Council of the CSSD to check their knowledge of the slang-marked language that has occurred in the Council in the last years when the current members of the coalition were governed by Prague.
The encodered dictionary used by Prague's flower and political birth during the previous period, by Master Pavel Bém, includes some of the most known characteristics, characterizations and causes of metropole.
Surprisingly, it has been checked that new concealers almost do not understand these known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"The truth is that I don't know."
"Better I am a new in the praguense policy," he introduced during the "collegeo" termology review the Lukas Kaucky culture concept.
And with regard to the political veterinary, he repeated the same Karel Brézina.
Maybe you know the concept of golf.
"It's probably the only expression of all you asked me what I used once."
"If not, usually not job slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions have been published in the June before the ODS voting conference, the editor has chosen six examples, in particular those who are particularly related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "major golf hooy of Prague", "ir to the pasteria", "noise of toro", "traition of capital" and "blindar".
Three concerts accepted the test and a quarter, Antonin Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, at first accessed, but did not take the phone again.
The fifth conceal, Peter Dolininek, refused to do it rightly.
"I don't care about these things, nor do I think I appreciate how the democratic civilians divorced."
"What I am interested is how we will understand in the implementation of our programmes," he said.
As it was seen, the conceal Lukas Kaucky would not have realized that the previous title was an expression on a influent businessman and a friend of the exalcalde Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucky the word "Voldemort" doesn't say anything; the only term that he claimed in the review is "the largest golf box of Prague".
"It's Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky, which adds immediately, "but I know more about the news."
"I'll have to point to a course of language," she broke.
Karel Brézina is not the only one who recognises the Blanka tunnel in the golf box, but also the Middle Environment Conceal Lukas Plachý.
Then, both sociodemocrats know who is actually Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý even know where to find that person; also, suspect the meaning of "Go to the pastery".
"I think it means to go to a Prague company; it is soon revealed to Plachý that is the Janoušek company's seat.
Like Brezina, such knowledge has been obtained from the news, but it does not use such vocabulary.
Participants in the test are: among sociodemocrats there is no such family glossary of coloquial terms.
"I asked my companions, but it really seems that we have nothing like it."
"But, among us we use apodos, sometimes abbreviations or games of words with the names," says the Chairman of the CSSD, Petr Hulininský, whose party partners call Hulda.
"In the college, I was called Brzyza, but I don't know if my companions also call me like this," he confessed his own appetite Karel Brézina.
The magazine Actualně.cz tested the name and worked.
For his party companions, Weinert is Déda (like "yayo") or, less friendly, Dédek ("vijo"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom were associated before the engaging elections during the party's patrocinium, he receives the appode of "Playmobil" by some of his companions.
Apodos are also the only expressions that sociodemocrats tolerate in the talk within the party.
Hulininsky doesn't like the lamen Hulda, but the newspaper Actualně.cz also discovered other appointments for this president.
"The doctor of the rights of the bastards" seems to be reminded that Petr Hulininsky obtained his doctorate in law in Bratislava's police.
The Government wants to limit the torture of "brows", it was published in a brochure
Women considered as bruises in Burkina Faso have certain features.
They seem to have an advanced age, they cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and do not have children.
Women who "return" brushes are sent to an area here so that they don't hurt the rest of the people.
"The men rarely suffer like that."
"There is also not appealing to healthy young women because they are helping in the labs and have children," explains a monastery that, in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso is occupied in a special residence of more than 100 women expelled from their communities.
The local Government has decided to oppose this "social measure".
He issued an informative brochure that should contribute to avoid the jail of brushes.
However, this has a stick.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," warns the journal Die Standard on the disappointments of written employment.
Bridge accusations are also common in other African countries.
In Gana, neighborhood of Burkina Faso, last week Ammy Hemmah died, 72 years old when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors have been deserved to a little deceived of circumstances.
Its version is held, the woman was arrested in the oil used for ritual units.
He was arrested in fire when the group wanted to "eject the bad spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of the "brows" supports people at all levels of education.
The journal Der Standard quoted a 42-year Businessman in Burkina Faso: "The human meat consumers always represented a danger," he advised.
While in Burkina Faso the Government's pausing the jail of bruises, the president still participated in it last year.
"The President Jammeh, after his grandfather's death, lan't a large jail of the bruises that, probably, had been related to his death and had killed his own president through black magic."
"To help you, he brought calls from near Guinea that, protected by police, military and personal listening of the president, were led to the force of men and women chosen randomly among the peoples of the president in Kanilai," in its report the International Amnisty Organization states.
In the fingerprint, arrested people had to drink a pool of grass with alucinogenic effects that also caused them intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested didn't deal with the stay in the fingerprint.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detained persons.
Bakala's inquilino: heavy with carbone and sign a higher winner
The man, advanced and new age, cross the doors of the attention center to the RPG Byty client of Zdenňek Bakala's "carbon magnate" client, the largest private owner of tissues in the Czech Republic.
Below the arm, he carried some documents with the new treasury contracts of three steps: his, his daughter's, and his son's, who is executing judgment.
The three just picked up the liberalisation of the winners.
Instead of 3.500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay from the next year 4.100 crowns for two stations with separate kitchen from second category.
"Therefore, there is no warm water and the heat is based on a solid fuel calder," shows the man with his finger in the new contract of his son, whose signature has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains the middle of angry, half resigned.
The Civil Association BytyOKD.cz, which qualified the new conditions of acquisition as "incorrect and unfair", recommends inquiryers who do not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, the date where a guide will be published to inform how to do in these cases.
But before this, the man just makes a damn.
"Everything says one thing," he says badly.
Ostrava is converting into a large number of liberalization tests.
After New Year, the large majority of the stairs that, in the Czech Republic, were at the moment under a regulated rental.
Therefore, Currently.cz was decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG Minerary Wait Room is one of the four of Ostrava and on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Just at the doors are the security guards and a machine at its side to take number.
"Acquiler 2011", you can read on a button of your tactyl screen.
When pressing it, get out of the machine a paper with a number.
Almost doesn't give time or read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen that is on the top of the room.
In a second, you're at school.
Shortly later, a advanced age marriage comes to ask, but the multitude of the room is not here for the new winners.
Most people are coming to solve habitual problems, such as ancient: applications for arrangements, insurance and similar matters.
The letters with the new winner contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the inquilina buzons of most of the 44,000 stages belonging to RPG around the middle of November.
RPG Byty proposes in letters an increase in the winner from 15 to 38%.
On November 18, a special window is opened in the client's attention center for new winners.
"It works a week, so it's starting," replied the workers who are in it shortly when the client is presented as a journalist.
Liberalisation and the old stairs for miners in Bakala are the most delicate issues in the area.
Before the elections, the Parliament's president, originating in Ostrava, Lubomir Zaorálek, of the CSSD, has already treated them highly and clearly, and now they appear continually in the area's journals.
"Twenty years later I want a new ground."
"I haven't changed the damn bathroom plat," the man mentioned in the introduction is disappointed.
Workers are currently coming more than anything jubilated to check if they receive a disregard in the winner if they sign at a time, as the special offer of RPG promises.
The rest of the inquiliners who sign the new contract before 15 December will also receive the half of the disregard on the February acquisition.
However, the "free-liberalisation" window will certainly not be able to discipline the wallet of doubts.
"From the 360 clients who were here yesterday, they only asked for the winner in 2011 about 40 or 50 people," recalls the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, the RPG proposes on the website and on its tables to conduct individual meetings on contracts, where necessary.
If both parties do not reach an agreement on the winner, an independent judge must solve the matter.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only way to walk and completely in accordance with the law," it warns RPG on its pages.
"This is not going to judge anyone," one of RPG Byty employees and a man who is on the street before the customer's attention center gives at least partly the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I remain 5,000 for food; I have no means to come to the courts."
But immediately the employee seems the doubt.
"We'll see it."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns you in the means that they don't sign, so people may wait," he advises.
The acquisition regulation will stop in the majority of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, if RPG Byty, its increase is an economic need.
"The current accommodations are not yet covering the quantities necessary for the maintenance of the community's fund," replies Pavel Klimeš, director of the RPG Byty residential portfolio, which adds that the disturbance of the Community's foundation that is disappointed to the inquilinos is, for the owners, the main reason to increase the winner.
While during the five years they passed between 2005 and 2010, the RPG could invest in 4 billion apartments, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014, the number will increase to 5.200 million.
The big screen that covers the tissue, in front of the seats of the waiting room, now repeat some data that highlight in red.
"The increase in the acquisition in 2011 in 15% and less is applied to 31.200 apartments, e.g. over 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be at least 7,50 Czech krone men per square meter," it is indicated on the screen.
Only increase in 38% the winner of 400 steps from the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low quantities, 19.66 crowns per square meter," says RPG.
In 2.600 feet, the winner will remain inappropriate for the next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not affect the winners, but will be scaled between four and eight years.
Furthermore, add the following commitment: the company will invest all the money of the rental (see the graph) again in the stairs, mainly in warming: new windows and heating.
They will have priority to those who sign the acquisition agreement.
architects have understood that offices also need guardy
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new site of the Arch.Design company.
No one would say that he also hides a small guardy inside it with all these installations: walls of colors, creative mobiles and even a miniature park on the outer terrace.
Since October of the past year, the children of the Arch.Design employees can come to her.
The Arch.Design architectural project company, from which many known buildings came from Brno, thought from the first buckets of the Aviopoint building, including a space for its mini-guard.
In the company they work about 90 people, mainly at the age of the baby boom, and they wanted to allow architects and delineants to return to work soon after maternity.
With the possibility of enjoying a reduced time, the guard is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers to its workers in the framework of its social programme.
Constructors and architects in this way have the possibility of combining a needed profession with children's care.
The Ministry was an idea of the architectural employees and, with the support of the direction, were able to obtain financing from the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs.
The company ' s mini-guardy is financed by the European Social Fund under the Operating Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the granted financing (a dot of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) were able to buy the equipment and, after two years, qualified staff contract and services.
When financing (two years), the Arch.Design has the obligation to maintain the mini-guardy with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project was a year and the Economy Rating has contributed to the presentation of the request for financing.
Children's attention is in the hands of qualified staff; they are also present every day for their care, a teacher and a teacher of the Ministry of Education. The guardian currently accepts children without a limited age, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since it is a "mini-guard", it can only take up a maximum of five children simultaneously, although the tours are more on the day.
The work of the guard is flexible to adapt the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the guardian, independently from hierarchy within the company.
Although it is a individual education and care, the contents of the mini-guard programme are comparable to the regular pre-school education programme.
In it children are not only playing, but also receiving a quality teaching: from the basic education to the preparation for school, they learn to English.
The class does not only have games and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of small children in the own company create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of getting children late from college when they are remote from their job.
So parents are more productive when they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and its employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is situated among companies signing that offer a great benefit for the admission of new workers: supporting the family and finally reforcing the staff marketing programme.
The house of the bones is still fascinating after 100 years. Note Gaudí's interiors
The tissue seems to be the loom of a prehistoric lagar, the stages correspond to the column of a dinosaurium and the balconies seem to be the mouth of a open fish.
This is the Batlló House, in Barcelona, of the catalyst architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of their way similar to a skelet, the locals joined it "the house of the bones".
Its organic forms, their calling colors, the new use of the stone, the fragments of blue and mosaic, a fashion that corresponds to the scales and all present lines quietly curved, all this is typical of the section of Antoni Gaudí.
The door of the house plays with oner lines, delicate colors and textures out of nature and fauna.
More attention, a certain geometry, ritme and a carefully thought order is observed.
On the night, the whole fashion of the house seems even more impressive, since it is illustrated so that the colors are improved.
Serpentee and the torsion of the forms continues to surprise us also inside it.
The ondulated wood copys the frames of windows, bardles, gates ornaments, mirrels and letters.
The Casa Batlló, located in the campaign of Emple at number 43 of the Animated Trade Street of Passeig de Gracia, came from the remodelation of a house of 1877 from the Emily Sala Cortés architect.
The reconstruction was two years old and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the industrial rica Josep Batllou, first insisted on throwing the previous building and starting from zero, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of performing a newly nice and nice reconstruction.
However, the Batlló House, formed by several apartments, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He cooperated in the design of the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
In fact, in their plans of the project, the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaic used in the façade was adorned.
In the fashion also workers of other creators and artists.
Cooperation in the proposals of the Batlló House was the beginning of Jujol's successful cooperation with Gaudí.
Jujul participated in the building of the House Milá and the Güell de Gaudí Park, where other parts of it are located.
As a result of their organic form, the locals soon after their ended up it "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism for opening windows, began to call it "the house of boss".
It is also said that at the top of the building, the sword of San Jorge, the pattern of Catalogue appears.
Other cultural elements of construction hide religious reasons.
Gaudí projected in the house a unique system for the central heating time with ventilation respiratory and typical chemicals.
It can be strange forty-five degrees your inclination.
Construction, Gaudí did not absolutely respect the construction standards of the time and did not allow them to be influenced.
However, the construction received the relevant authorisation from the beginning, although the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were evidently so empty that, two years later, after its end, the assembly was so affected by the result that it requested to be corrected.
For example, he was disappointed by the construction of columns even to the public stairs.
The arrangements were never made, rather than the contrary: only fifty days after the conference request, Josep Batlló requested (and received) permission to accommodate the two highest steps of the building.
The owner was installed in the lower stages.
In the gallery of the second floor, the room and the rooms were located in the third stage and the private part of the apartment.
The low plant was acquired of a gamery.
The house, of six feet, is completely crossed by a stage that leads to the terrace of the tissue.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all right angles and lines, covering them from curved walls.
Gaudi also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can be communicated in such a way without problems, without renewal to the privacy needed for more closer conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, was not only obtained a new fashion, but also a inu tissue and two additional steps.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white blue and to covering the internal party and tragaluses.
The game with the two colours brings the maximum light on all the floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colours, which, in contrast, absorb the sun rays.
What person can visit the Batlló House, which was added in 2005 to the list of world heritage of the Unesco humanity.
In the first stage of the house, the most space and reloaded apartment of the public is located.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the creator.
With visits, they confirmed or discovered that it was a very beneficial business and extended visits to the common area and to the buhardilla, including the terrace of the tissue.
The price of the input to the monument is not insignificant, although 16,50 euros are reached, although students, convictions and holders of tourist cards are 20% disregard.
The overall amount considers the price of the input price of other Gaudí constructions in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real environment of the bed with your lagart towers, you should make a friend quickly of some resident in the neighborhoods and visit you home.
How the choices are chosen: Women and men seek different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really gives his quality to a good bed is the surface to bubble, that is, the cocktail and the somer.
First of all, they must be supplemented to the perfectity in order to adapt to specific users.
Election comes into game many elements, including weight, height, health status and owner's sex.
It is also important that the type of inside where the cocktail is located and the summer is located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend-end box that does not frequently have warmth, latex cups should not be used because they "heat" slowly.
Furthermore, they are sought to consider more than normal polyuretan colchons.
Therefore, it is necessary to give them the flight more frequently.
If the channels of the centre are not suitablely flying and, above, they are on a firm basis, they keep inside the humidity. It can even appear a mood below.
At the time of choosing a bed, they also affect customs.
Who has spent a lot of time in the foreigner, often uses a very high cocktail with a mixed layer and has problems to feel well on a lower and harder surface.
"Nearly all hokey players who returned from NHL complained that they were not sleeping right here."
"For their shirts, chairs, and chairs, they needed cockons with a mixed board of viscoelastics."
"That kind of colchons are also recommended for people with diabetes that time are problems in the nervous system, so they are wrong to receive information about articulations and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, which is specialized in the mobiliary.
Many hokey players, like other customers, take time to prefer the viskoeleastic cockons.
"There is no problem today, because they have these suitable Timers and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech Mark Tropico."
There is no need to be a NHL player anymore to be able to guard viscoelastics.
This "wonderful" works in a very simple way.
Optimize your heat and form depending on the absorbed heat or adapt to its body heat.
Nothing exercises pressure; during the night, he will not turn back as after a hard party.
Simplely, if I sleep better.
Viscoeleastic also works as a protection against the beaches.
When choosing the size of the cocktail, adds the length of its feet at its height, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be in a double room of 90 cm totally 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, such as solitaires, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
That a possible visit may also be comfortable.
"If not, a simple standard can be applied to calculate the width: when you buy the mouth up, you should have the hands comfortablely attached to the cods," advises the engineer Helena Prokopová, expert of Cechu chalouniku to decoratives, which has been occupied for many years from the healthy dream problem and the mobiliary ergonomia, which refers to the specialized schools.
In the double rooms, everyone needs his own summer and colch, so during the purchase, you need to give attention to combine the height of the colchons.
In the contrary, it will be necessary to mount sounds at different heights, which is not always possible at all beds.
Spume collars should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with inside of mules at least 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer adapted to forms and sweetness.
"When you touch it with your hand or get in the colchon, no doubt the muelles should not be noted," advises Helena Prokopová.
Each cockpit repeats a specific type of sound.
The bedrooms completely embraced, in which the cocktail and the base are like semes, have no sense in the bed.
Colchons breathe badly and can't wash their background, which is often done today.
And, since we transplant between 0.2 and 0.75 l sugar each night, it is clear that after about five or seven years, the cocktail will begin to remember a large (and congestioned) tamiz.
For this reason, specialists are the slogans who speak of a life of a colchon of up to 25 years or even of a life guarantee.
However, everything has one but.
Therefore, sellers give a advice: in cowls with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully care about the weight and washing of the background, but better adds a cocktail protector that can be easily recovered and washed.
Although currently foundations are produced with cremaller closure in all its perimeter, then when opening them remains in two parts (a very important thing for lavage and size of lava!), their manipulation in the models of greater size (and by one person) when heating the cockon can seem to be a fight between a mosque weight and a heavy weight.
In the bed, instead of a song, have you a firm table?
Never!
How much for beds thought to pass a night visits.
However, it must be made (if you do not have them) ventilation stories on the table and should be used with a cow with mules inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with bottles in bottles (as the German Taschenfederkern) and a mixed layer.
Polyuretan collines should not be used on such bases.
For latex or sadwich cocktails (e.g. a combination of latex and coco fibre), although it is always better a summer with a larger number of laminas, 28 or more, where the lambs of the lumbar area are strengthened and can be regular.
Sounds of articulable lamination should not be used with a cup of mules, as it does not re-recline to the reclination.
Besides the heat adjustment of the lamination, the protection of the hair can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the laminas that allows pressure or, even, to draw the laminas so that "rode" perfectly to the backs during the dream.
For men who have very wide hands, it is something very important.
They are even agreed by cocktail manufacturers who, in the "mankinds", began to use a mixer area exactly around the backs.
They also agree with women, for which they put a mixer area in turn to the chairs.
For most needing clients, there are sounds with ≥ in cross or tables with the called multitortion amortiguation.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the pressure is decreased.
Take also note that, even though it uses the cocktail and suitable sounds, if it uses a bad holiday (grande and "mulida"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the holiday must support the head and is it only can reach the backs so that the muscles of them can be relaxed.
The appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Escandinavia.
When you buy on the side, the hole must be at the same level (when it is combined with the somer with refugee for breasts or the mixed area of the colchon) than the height of the hair.
Modern cocktails have something to see, it seems, with the original cocktails filled with birds.
Manufacturers are still using natural materials or at least mixed.
In fact, biological colchons are mode.
Oil-based primary materials, with which the polyuretan espuma is produced, are filled with natural oil, such as ricin or soja.
In fact, almost all known manufacturers use soja.
"Biological, in the case of colchons, means that the centre is produced only from natural origin materials," explains Petr Vašíček from the Tropico Plus company.
In addition, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the base of the colchons, one of the first real aloe.
But it can also be opted by the microcapsulas, which free a fresh boss or lavand aroma.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with vegetable extracts of brises, so that the foundation of the colch absorbs the heat and refreshers the body, women prefer "calenting" the background.
Red penetration extract improves the blooding, so women feel more heavy.
The favorites now?
Cold-spum-produced cocktails, which are more poor, with a ≥ adapted cell, which makes them more permeable than normal polyuretan and offers more permeasibility.
Combination of various cold and viscoeleastic smooths allows the manufacture of colchons of various areas that know perfectly where the head, the backs and the hallons go.
A good quality cow will cost you seven thousand crowns upward.
Those who exercise a therapeutic function are supposed to have a lower VAT, as they are considered as health media.
The first of this benefit in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's complicated to cover in the cocktails and sounds.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two colchons for one price.
For example, the Magniflex mark offers Duofre cups with a memo memory at the foundation by 11.990 crowns.
The second is obtained freely.
The era of the viscoelestic with an open cell and a great density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially, it arose as a material for NASA, because during the dishes of astronautes were seen subject to a huge overload.
The time is covered with the heat and endures with the cold.
Therefore, the human body, heavy, exercises a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to avoid the occurrence of beaches, even though it is also to improve comfort during the dream.
The viscoelestic espuma is not only used in the colchons but also for health products, for example for almohades that are placed under the feet and alivian, as well as their employment.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similar.
More parents use people's monitoring devices to control their children
The fear of children leads to more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, considered initially for car monitoring, can also follow the movement of persons, and thus contribute, for example, to the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
For the moment the device has the approximate size of a circle box, but will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people feared the case of the disappeared Anička and began to inform about the media available to protect their children better.
Even the side of invading your privacy.
"We all tell us that it is not a spy, but another means to reduce the possibilities of a tragedy," Peter Pilin of the Macro Weil company, one of the monitoring equipment providers in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in some cases, you can abuse such devices, for example if you are put into the ball of someone without its knowledge, but we haven't yet met with such cases."
"The majority of customers actually buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In their opinion, children should always know why the "cajita" serves and how it is used in case of emergency.
Infantil psychologist Dana Bočkova warns about the fact that if the kid doesn't want to take it, he'll just take it.
"Including smaller children show great creativity at the time of intentionally certain things if they want to avoid controlling them."
"Earlier, the parents trusted enormously in the mobiles, but these could be removed as easily as the monitoring device," -- Bočkova.
In your opinion, it is debatable if such device is really useful in case of attack.
"If this is a prepared square, the author will almost always check if the child has some kind of electronic device that can discover its location."
"Now it's the phone."
"The use of monitoring devices will be extended, and it will also seek them, because their sale will certainly be made with a lot of publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always take a step before the police," says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack of a pedofil.
Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, who offers monitoring services both for vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the monitoring device is destroyed immediately, your presence can serve as a help.
"You can configure the device to send the position regularly after a specified period."
"If it suffers damage, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person concerned."
"The most dear devices are integrated with a inclination measurer, so if the person simply is blown and remains inmovable, the device will immediately give a warning with the position concerned."
In your opinion, a service of this type can even be obtained with smart mobile phones with navigation, where only a special software should be installed.
The problem of current monitoring units is that it is currently a device with a size similar to a box of circles or smaller size mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be.
See Pilin de Macro Weil, therefore tests are currently performed with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added benefit that a possible agressor may not identifie the device."
"Or what identifies it after a certain time, which can make the police win time," adds.
Although the monitoring devices are carried out in the munich or collapsing, they will continue using the same technology used for vehicle monitoring.
This is the test of position with a GPS system (used in the normal navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough mechases to round all Czech, but they're only two years old.
The Czech army bought 445 km of mecha to catch explosives.
Last year, the Defence Minister added to its arsenal 224 kilometers of mixture.
Therefore, they have existence for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the mecha is two years, four to the top.
The army bought the mecha for explosives to the STV Group, etc. for forty million crowns.
The general staff responded to MF DNES, justifiing the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha, saying that soldiers need for 60 miles per year training manuals.
However, the estimates of the army pirotics, with which the MF DNAs has been contacted, are decided that, in such cases, these manuscripts should be carried out with frequency use of explosives each year, too, all generals, high-order officers, and even secretarians and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They did not want exemptions nor the Defence Minister Alexander Vondr and the captain of Vlastimil Picek Army.
Only this could be justified that the army costs sixty miles of mixture.
That length is equal to 25,000 explosions.
Although so, the army would have sufficient existence for over ten years.
In contrast, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional with a maximum of two metres of mixture, the army would have sufficient existence for the 225 above.
The soldiers of the quick intervention brigade have personally been complained to Minister Vondra a few years ago because they say they have only a munition for several weapons, so they are even limited to the currency practices for money.
And let's not talk about the lack of internal clothes.
"I can't even understand that they repeatedly understand such quantities of mixing."
"But it's your decision and, of course, they will know why they do so."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom, as a company, we will satisfy," admits the STV Group's commercial director, Jan Decky.
The carrier of the Defence Minister Jan Pejšek defenses the hundreds of miles of mecha, also saying that it will have the existence of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Decky, of the STV Group, indicates that the mecha has only a four-year useful life and, in the case of pirotical products for the army or police, two-year.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can take up to four," says one of the soldiers who, for the possible critics of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each munition should be checked carefully to see if it is still reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and re-reserve an additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that when buying 445 km of mixed, it was obtained a disregard.
"We have been covered by 60% less than the last year's request of 244 km," says Pejšek's carrier from the Defence Minister's Buy Centre.
Only to compare: annual mixing consumption of police pirotics, which eliminate the Munition of the Second World War or left by the Soviet Army, has not exceeded 1500 metres ago.
Furthermore, the police always asks just the right amount to exhaust the munition before the end of its useful life.
It was decided for security reasons for pirots and, in addition, as long as more modern and reliable mixing types can be achieved.
The Ministry has already clear difficulties to finish tens of thousands of tons of munitions in the period of Varsovia, when the Checoslovakian army of 200 000 people was prepared for a campaign in the Rin.
The pyrotics with which MF DNAs spoke, after a few years, the following problem with the present will occur: it will be to remove hundreds of miles of old mixture, which is now buying "barata".
Even now I continue to live from the contacts I have received thanks to the concurrence
The winning of the "Annual Empressary" concurrence helped Lukas Pytloun in the sale of his hotel's franknesses.
The latest and §, wined the concurrence "The Year's Empress" 28-year-old Lukas Pytloun of Liberec.
Your success history seems to know about a movie.
And Luke Pytloun just liked a traveler.
In the foreigner, it was noted that Liberec needed quality accommodation at a good price.
With the awards he meet with stational work in the foreigner and a loan of the foreigner bought a house that was a half-broke composed of five steps.
Taking into account that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really courageous.
"Now, the quality-price relationship of the accommodation in our area has moved me to do something about it," says Luke Pytloun.
Beginning to gain the first restructured step to foreign workers.
All incomes that were obtained re-investment in the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he was quickly able to open four pensions in Liberec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, even a few years ago, the Pytloun design hotel of four stars.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we sold our concept of franchise, and others are showing interest in a Pytloun frankness," said the businessman number one of the last year.
"To this sale of licences for the opening of hotels helped greatly the fact of winning the concurrence of the 'Empire of the Year'," adds the thankful Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surroundings.
"The people recognized me in the street, still congratulated me often, and, I must say, it was very pleasant," recalls.
Of course, he recommends that everyone want to have any company to participate in the concurrence.
But it does not think that it is necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
Appreciate that it still lives from contacts and known ones that, without the concurrence, may not have been obtained.
"Concerning some people I knew thanks to the concurrence, I began to cooperate usually."
The fame associated with success, in its opinion, also included employees,
totally about seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and they are proud of participating in something that has been obtained by the general recognition."
"It's not, not much less, my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of the whole team."
"It's only my name that appears first," says Luke Pytloun modestyly today.
I want my follower a more quiet year than we had in Farmet.
Euphoria for the victory was soon disciplined by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already passed the worst.
The owner of the Farmet company, Karel Žárský, received the first premium in the last and § of Vodafone's concurrence "Annual Business", last year in the "Slave House" of Prague.
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he could convert a small technical taller in Cheská Skalice to a signature with a volume of hundreds of million businesses.
"I can say that the premium has not only encouraged me, but all my partners and has improved our confidence in combating competition," says the winner of the last year.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel Žárský's father the winner of a small biller as compensation for the imminence of properties during the communism, he did not doubt too much; he rejected its position in the company where he was working and, with a couple of companions, the company founded with his father of plastic piles.
Shortly later, they began to specialize in vegetable oil pressures.
Eight years later, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic pressures in the centre of Europe.
They also received a greater presence among the non-specialised public after the success of the concurrence in the media.
"Not only our customers began to consider the Farmet mark as well, but the foreign partners also began to appreciate the cooperation with a company who had been more successful in his country," Karel Ždárský said.
Last year may not have been in Farmet just a sample of the euphoria of the victory.
He also obtained recognition for commercial results until 2008 and, in part, 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the hardest year for the sale of mine.
The increasing crisis, which has not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and started to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, obviously, don't save ourselves from such a situation."
"The income was reduced to 40%, we had to limit production and even had some exemptions," explains Karel Žárský.
A sustainable company should, at times, take even less popular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the profits of the company, even though it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
However, Farmet did not cover expenditure was in research and development.
"We have built a research and training center with subventions, strengthening the presence of the international market and obtaining great values in national festivals," says Jdžárský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Income re-increases and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expects to have a sense of victory, but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel Žárský said.
A survey that reveals ridicule standards
The survey of Absurdez of the year is part of the business tournament fourth time.
You have already removed some ridiculous standards.
The unknown winner of the new and Other Inquiry Absurdez of the year was the obligation to carry out documents to which officers could online.
The decision adopted more than one third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security requested an extraction from the market registry, although their officers can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the investigation, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extraction of the market registry when controlling the taxes of the insurance," stated the CHSSZ portfolio Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the year's absurdity investigation is to consult the rules and regulations which should be respected by companies and businesses in Czechland and to eliminate those who are absurd.
This year forms a fourth part of the business tournament of the publication of Hospodárské newny and begins to create an affection among the general public.
While the e-year last year had participated in three thousand voters, this year has almost reached the four thousand.
And it does not be surprising, since we still have various legal obligations of surface that must be respected simply for trade.
"It may be in the number of papers necessary for the statement of taxes we are first worldwide," comments Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Media Enterprises and Business of the Republic of Czech Republic.
Since years, simplification of business standards is a declared objective of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improving particularly in the Czech Republic.
The World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for a company, is located in the 74th position of the Czech Republic, which is eight worse places than last year.
Absurdez of the year was first celebrated in 2006 and each year repeated the same way.
What may indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and September, when the concurrence is closed.
The proposals can be made on the web page www.firmaroku.cz. The concurrence organizer then selects seven candidates for the "antipremium" and, in October, allows the public to vote on the Internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity he receives more votes.
For the survey of this year, more than one hundred, in particular 105 rules and regulations that have no meaning.
The examples have been sent to both businesses and professional and journalist associations.
Among the "finalistes" of the concurrence, for example, was the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and carriers pay the peague or that businessers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms pink the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals of this year is published on the pages of the concurrence.
The announcement of the concurrence, which is always performed at the beginning of November at the Wenceslao Place of Prague, is part of an event in which they are to participate in the political and social world.
This year, for example, they attended this act of the concurrence of Eva Svobotová, director of the Association of Small and Media Enterprises and Business of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Republic Commerce Chamber.
"The economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continues to work for businessmen, therefore my goal is to eliminate at least 30 paragraphs each year that are currently inevitably complicating trade," announced by the Minister for Industrie and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in the water of erasing.
In 2007, the most disturbing people was the obligation of the company to communicate with an antelation of three days to the business office of the permanent functioning area, the intention of attending a vacation or exposure.
This obligation was deleted in the new industrial law.
The obligation that I completed secondly in number of votes in 2007, namely the communication to the work office by its foreign workers from work traveling up to 30 days, was deleted in the law of the called Green Card.
And to the third, he won her.
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapeutics to have a great speech, a neck and two bases of ground.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had removed the obligation to have a noise.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The newness in this fifth and § concurrence of Hospodárské newny is the category called Enterprise responsible for 2010.
The committee of this concurrence consists of supporting the responsible and righteous companies.
"In this way, we want to support companies who are occupied with the impact of their environmental activities and who support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the Vodafone mobile operator, organiser and patrocine of the concurrence, as in the case of the concurrence of the Rebelde of the year.
For this new special subcategory of the e* this year of Vodafone Company's main concurrence in 2010, enterprises for which commercial success is not the only long-term target.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities were fully different between one and another, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is, for example, regarding persons disabilities, in other personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists of the whole Republic, for example, the company was appreciated of the Et Netera software, which supports the training of informal sport equipment among its workers, which then participate in tours of various sports.
Another example of company responsible for the Pardubice area is Isolit-Bravo, which has been seven years old as the main fund supplier to patrocinate children with disabilities.
In Podébrad, there is a paper that is particularly concerned about the health problems of their employees, since they are more than 70% of the model; therefore it received the title of the Employment responsible from the central area of Czechland and in the concurrence of Vodafone Employment of the year ended thirdly in the region.
In Olomo_ wins the MiRyz Soft accounting company, which reduced the working hour, even under the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing the salaries.
The title was also authorised because it purchased primarily to Czech producers, supported Community activities in the area and respected the environment.
"We are trying to renew as far as possible in order that our production and administration activities produce the least possible environmental impact," explains Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible TI Enlogit company of the Usti region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each phone, offers them a ship and keyboards; also supports the work from home and in its business events using the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Beca Persona in matters, which is particularly helping the local Roman community," comments the representative of the company Ondréj Suchý.
They are also placed in a good place with a mention of Praní's company to clean the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonifications in a special way that affect their pension funds.
"We give advantages in food, transport, improved qualifications and occision," says Joseph Straч, from the building company of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the region of Moravia-Silesia.
In the Categories of Employment responsible for the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Business concurrence of the year were automatically designed to answer the issues of the registration formula and sent it to organizers before 15 August.
Organizators removed from the assessment the forms that were not complete or wrong.
"If the representatives of the competitive companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the concurrence of the business responsible for the year, but they would not be disqualified from the "principal" concurrence Vodafone Employment of the year."
"Independent candidatures for this concurrence are not allowed, since it is a subcategorie of the main concurrence of the year," explains Karel Goldman from Bison & Rose adviser.
The police took arrests during a public substance in the building of the Agricultural Fund in Pilsen
Police against corruption has made several arrests in the building of the Agricultural Fund in the last days.
The detectives committed a local businessman in the media sector and the Immobiliary Business Luboš G.
It seems that this is trying to manipulate a current public subsequence for the refund of rights so that the subsequent land would receive a precise interested.
I should have paid Luboš G. a half million crowns for that.
"For the moment, I can only say that the police seeks a person for sovereignty during a public undertaking and public invitation," said Pravo's head of Pilsen Antonie Zelena's general fiscal, adding that it can't explain more about the current investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released 46-year business officer.
About how it could influence the public subcast, given the few official information, it can only be speculated.
The carrier of the Agricultural Lubomira Black Fund answered the questions of Pravo, saying that the police actually carried the arrest in the Pilsen seat and went on during a public substap.
"It's a client, not one of our workers," he needed.
See Montenegro, the public submarine is called "Convocatory for the presentation of proposals for land transfer in accordance with the Law on Earth" and is carried out when several interested parties appear in the area offered.
"These people, during the convocation, offer a greater value than their refund, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"On the basis of the offers, the order of the purchasers is determined and, then, the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the greatest offers," explained the carrier of the Fund.
Luboš G. had information about who to be presented to the convocation and, as at the same time, as he was interested in the acquisition of several refund rights, he proposed the interested parties on the area that would not participate in the submarine.
Please, it was covering a committee.
This would explain that at the time of arrest, it had so much money over.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It figured in the cause of the old leader of the PF Václav Sankot, which was accused of exhausting the substitution of lands for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund a planned area for the construction of public infrastructure, especially in the place where a large road to the industrial area of Borská pole should be built.
Then he changed them very beneficially with the judge by a house in the historical center of the city with a very higher value.
In this case, the assembly had to intervene because, in other cases, the locked lands would avoid construction.
Families shall pay additional expenditure of several hundred crowns per month
Homes will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and electricity, heating plugins and, in some cases, greater profits.
Therefore, the families will have to get out of the wallet from January, several hundreds of crowns per month more than now.
Electricity price increases by 4.6%, gas around 2%, in some cities it must pay up to 10% more for water supply, and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise of electricity for families living in apartments should be about 100 crowns over the year than now.
However, the main electricity providers decreased the prices because it has increased support for the production of renewable sources, in particular photography.
However, gas is moderately concerned, especially when heating is more used and therefore consumption is greater.
In this case, they should also have a couple of hundreds of crowns over the year.
While electricity and gas are concerned throughout the country, the price change in central heating varied from one to another.
The price ascending is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the households of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January for central heating about 50 crowns per month, while Liberec's families will pay more than 1000 extra crowns per year.
The residents in Prague must also endure a increase of 9% of the water price and heating, especially when the city increases the gain of infrastructure.
If the winner wasn't different, the apprehensions would pay additional 6.8%.
However, the prices in Prague will continue to be among the lowest in the country.
In the north of Bohemia, where the current prices are among the highest, both rates will carry at 7.4%.
You can consider the prices of the winner of 450,000 feet in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which is located in Usti na Labem, will increase the rental from January to 100%.
The company will bring the courts to those who are not in accordance with the new winner.
Regulated winners, which benefit about 300,000 stages, could increase the year coming to 10%.
Young Czechs are drunk with Fernet and ron. The beer is no longer so, because it makes slow effect
Fernet, ron, vodka, and even good whiskeys stolen to their parents.
These are the drinks that result in medical care of young drinkers with a less than 15 years of age.
Children who finish throwing in the hospital continually to overcome the race are no longer an attitude.
This results from the experience of the doctors in such cases in hospital pediatry admissions.
"Beer or wine is no longer mode, because they're so late to drink them."
"Now the mode is the strong alcoholic drinks," says the Hospital Hořo's pediatry head in the centre of Bohemia, Ludék Pelikán.
"When they get a bottle to your father from the alacena, it can be whisky, but usually it's Fernet and vodka."
"The wodka has the advantage to be stuck with sugar and that he doesn't weep so much," explains.
It is also confirmed by the Porter of the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's often about Fernet or ron."
"These are modern alcoholic drinks, especially among schools."
"In some cases, they use waiting that they took home," adds Jurinová.
Boss Pelikan is, who are drinkers of thirteen and fourteen years of age, those who swim in hospitals.
In front of Hořo, where he worked since this year, he worked for a decade in the Motol pediatry, where ambulances led young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter four times."
"Empe held at the twelve years when it was brought with 3.5 alcohol in blood, as well as a mixture with extasis," says the doctor of the department on this case.
"He was at Holesho's festival at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother didn't surprise that her daughter disappeared 48 hours," the chief surprises.
It is exactly the lack of parents' interest or even their clear tolerance to drinking by their children, which is considered the main cause of increased alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts indicate that, in the case of children, it can not be spoken of dependence.
"A person who has a chronic alcohol dependence for several years, with all the phenomena associated with the same, which is not produced in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather, it is due to a systematic social or family environment failure," explains Chef Pelikan.
Jurinová’s carrier, this year at Motol’s pediatric clinic, was hospitalized until the middle of November 40 drink children.
However, statistics only show those coming with serious intoxication and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after walking medical recognition, go home with parents or police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply meet after school and drink awaiting, there are three stational highlights that must be mentioned: the day of bruises, the end of the year and the end of the school course.
"In such a situation, they drink by bad notes or otherwise celebrate the beginning of vacation."
"In the day of the bruises, I came to see admitions up to seven drinking children at the same time," adds Pelikan.
The drinkers who passed the night in desintoxication under the supervision of the doctors have paradoxically the advantage that the next day they did not suffer a terrible reaction at home.
Morning head pain, caused by dehidratation and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a glucose sugar and with the nutrients missing the body.
"They take him much better, because after the agitated night, they arise well and don't hurt anything."
"Only confusions are shown about where they are," said Pelikan, adding that patients often lose good humor at least when they see the expenditure they have generated.
Transfer in ambulance and hospitalisation in a room for serious patients comes to cost a decade of thousands of crowns.
"I often used the cost as a means of educating them, when I tell them exactly in the visit to the children how much their embryo has costed and that they would have to pass all summer on a job for young people to win enough to pay it that night," adds Pelikan.
The medical insurance, in its opinion, may be as a regressive measure, which often gives people the expenditure of treatment, does not do it in the case of children drinking.
Two aircrafts L-159 are first located in agenous hands in Spain
Two aircrafts L-159 of a total of five, where the Czech Defence Minister replaced the Airport House C-295M, divided on Tuesday to Sevilla, where the manufacturer of the Naves Casa - EADS is located.
It's the first time a device of this guy is located in the hands of someone who is not the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only in the foreign place to perform practice or demonstration flights.
This is the biplastic version L-159T1, which was still using the Czech army and was still in a flight.
The remaining three planes are L-159 monoplas.
These are still maintained in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediate, Omnipol, has already been charged with them last week.
Jan Pešek, from the Defense Press Department, indicates that it is not yet known that the aircraft will be physically removed from Vodochody.
"The monoplase L-159 aircrafts were, however, separated from the fixed aircrafts ago, without investment or additional contributions by the Minister."
"The L-159T1 biplasms have been exchanged in their current state," said Pravo Pejšek.
He added that the army would not remain without biplasy plans, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for a quantity of 200 million crowns for the construction of four L-159 unnecessary devices for biplasms.
One of the new aircraft has already received the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
See Pejšek, EADS committed to adding aircrafts to the equipment of some alienated countries.
"In the contract it is clearly indicated that EADS is the one who takes away the L-159 flights and that will serve for NATO's pilot practices."
"It is therefore dependent on the purchaser to decide how he will use them in this framework," said Pejšek.
The Hospodárské newny published ago that, for example, Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by a House Airport and the purchase of three other nights for 3.500 million crowns was approved by the Government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
The Defence Minister did not call for a purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence address that exchange promotes the future export of L-159 to the foreign.
The Czech army bought Aer 72 naves and only uses 24, so he wants to sell the rest.
Buying aeroplanes Home may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already claimed to the Czech Defence Ministry before the European Court because it should choose the aircraft by making a European invitation and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three house-flights and the last should come to the port of Kbely's appreciation in fourteen days.
A finger longer than the cancellation indicates a lower risk of cancer suffering
Men with the longer than the cancellation are subject to a less risk of suffering of prostat cancer.
This is the amazing conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British cancer magazine.
It could be of the level of testosterone, the man hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of suffering of prostat cancer, especially for men of age up to 60," indicated the co-operation of the Ros Eeles study, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger can help to determine which men should be subject to a test of prostat cancer, especially if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other damageous factors, such as family health problems, is indicated in Eeles.
1994-2009, followed with a British homologe of more than 1.500 patients with prostat cancer and, at the same time, 3.000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the indexed finger of the hand shorter than the cancellation.
They had the same chances of suffering prostat cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer than the cancellation finger, this risk was decreased to 33%; for men with age less than 60% the reduction is 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers concerned, determined during the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fat is exposed in the matrix.
A lower level of testosterone corresponds to a longer term.
Previous studies indicated that testosteron affects the development of prostat cancer.
The Great Czech and ancient president of the Science A ́mia, Professor Václav Paczes, said to CTK that knows the study, but that it does not seem that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can be "demonstrated completely".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, as most of Europe, sold on Thursdays of snow.
The roads and stairs are mainly embraced by compressed snow, and the remote machines held all night through many areas.
The road D5 was closed in the morning between the 89 and 93 miles in direction to Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial and tourist vehicles, as D1 in Brno in direction to Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Central Car Club (UAMK).
At the 91km, a truck was found, in the 93th shocking two industrial vehicles caused damage.
A number of tourisms also ended in the cunete.
There are also problems in the D1 carrier at 185 km in direction of Prague.
There they shot the trucks.
The drivers must be slowly following Brno at the 190km or through Brno and be incorporated into the 182km in Kývalce.
There have been appeals of several kilometers.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 road, rightly at Prague.
The Prague is ́armed by a snow layer of several centimeters and the termometres indicate -7 oC.
They are forming attacks, for example, in Prosek, although it is also congestioned in Stérboholska.
The safer transport media is the metro.
Trenvies are with a delay, for example in the line between Karlovo Namisti and Miru Namisti.
On the eightth morning, another crisis status will be held in Prague.
Problems also affect railways and ports.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three quickly.
Problems, for example, affect the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
The Ruzynie port has been closed from the eleventh night of Wednesday to the five of the morning.
Currently, most of the South Moravia roads can already be held, but with extreme care.
In Vyskovska, three secondary roads are closed, in Brnenska are sharing snow languages and in Blanenska are needed strings for certain ways of access to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyskovsko.
The connections are closed until the time: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherow and also Šaratice - Milešo.
To clear them, they will need freshers.
It can't be said at the moment that they will be opened to the relief.
In Hodonínska, care is repeated in the area of the White Carpaty (White Carpates).
The roads of the region that, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left in inert state, are collected up to five centimeters of snow, it is indicated in the TCK.
In Czechland they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in the north of Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches the 18 centimeters.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, they fell around 15 centimeters of snow.
Snows gradually release in Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time only by the encoding name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle affects the local conflict with the Taliban and that "changing the progress of the game" makes its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise pointer.
His balls are shot with a laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special calibre munition of 25 mm created for this rifle and the high load of explosives that contains actually results as a small granate.
Projects can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the goal, but at any point that is found in their balistic tragedy.
They can be used against enemies who are hidden after an obstacle, a wall or a trincher.
There is no doubt that normal protection can be used and, when the rain is launched by the murder of metal stalls, it may result essential in the battle.
Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of XM-25, the new fusil is the first weapon for infantery that uses a "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the goal, point to their laser radius, which determines the distance, then gets a precise lookpoint and, according to it, corrects the projection line and appreciates the cat."
"Let's say they've been measured 543 meters."
"When the cat is pressed, the weapon is loaded and laid the projectile at a distance of 543 metres, more than one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs are transferred
The consortium Fujitsu after his office in Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July of the next year, 400 employees will change their workplace of their previous office building in the Marienbader place in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu after branch office in Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As the giant of the specialised sector communicated on computers and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will be transferred in July of their previous office building in Marienbader place in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large compound of offices on the street Lyoner Street in Nederrad, Frankfurt.
A portfolio of Fujitsu explained that in a middle-term, 100 other employees of the consortium, which were previously designed by the region, will be located there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
Moreover, Fujitsu will be the only inquiry in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner advised, "on Franfkurt-Nederrad we found a central place with an excellent infra".
The importance of connecting to the port is now very important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new change in an important company in the region led to joy among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against.
Head of Frankfurt's Economy Section Markus Frank (CDU) said that there was a Global Player.
This is a "magn · recognition of the location".
Fujitsu sits in the city, sitting is a great impulse for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (Green) is regreting the decision of Fujitsu.
The address first informed the city about its intention.
"We have naturally offered our aid to the company," Korwisi stated.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader place have not been able to change in difficulties.
Finally, the economic reasons produced the fall.
In this way, there is now a great empty place to cover in the position.
"I hope that the owner and the drivinger of the building are cooperative."
The immobile used previously by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighborhood "Vertical Kleine" were part of the surrounding Marienbader space buildings since ten years of a controvertised project of the Balnear city.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the assembly, a new entry into the city, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive building that earlier used places as parking places and the level of buildings.
In 2001 the investment advice and taxation companies were installed, the Software manufacturer for reservations systems, Start Amadeus, and then Siemens joined the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was purchased by the immobiliary group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later returned to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu, originating in Tokio, is recognised as the third worldwide largest provider of TI.
It provides companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch at Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the elderly in Germany, in all ways Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The filial Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Nederrad, the following branches in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That is why 7000 square meters have been acquired in the Astro Park office building.
The old completion of the twenty-years, its name exhibits its plan in the form of a star, inter alia, to the central electrotic association and to the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the server - threats against Assange
Anxiety is always more than Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the discovery platform from your server.
The political pressure may be found behind after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the Wikileaks founder, seems to be arrested in England.
The Wikileaks revelations platform is always the white of critics, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for a Internet country in Europe.
The known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to the Wikileaks boicot.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, located in the list of people searched for Interpol, must remain arrested in Great Britain, is a article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the revelation activists communicated on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from your server.
Internet activists had required in the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon Services Web to be able to face high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfect, we'll assign our dollars to contract people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using his server via Wikileaks, after a Senator Joe Lieberman's employee had requested investigations, CNN chain informed if a call to the office of Lieberman was called.
The presidency of the Senate Council for the Security of the country had threatened Amazon with boicot, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to take these measures before the previous publications of information classified by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also use the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and unconscious process of Wikileaks plays our national security and threatens life in the world," it was reported in a communication of the independent senator.
"No company responsible, either American or foreigner, should help Wikileaks with his service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, seeking in Sweden for suspect of violation, is located in the list of people searched for Interpol.
It is a article of the London 'The Index' journal, the 39-year-old Australian is arrested in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has constantly qualified research in Sweden as a trama of his enemy.
The Wikileaks portfolio, Christinn Hrafnsson, came to London that had been threatened.
"There were even called on a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's security, Hrafnsson's awareness.
Therefore, it continues without discovering the location of the Wikileaks founder.
Hrafnsson was obvious to the statements of North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, suggested that the responsibility for Wikileaks' revelations should be judged by training and executed.
In Canada, a Governing Boss Stephen Harper's adviser, clearly ironic, in the television, Assange should be killed and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange grows a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the portfolio of the American President Barack Obama, qualified for "small and absurd" that Assange had requested the release of the state secretariat, if she was responsible for ordering recently to diplomatics involved in spying tasks.
"I'm not absolutely sure why you should import a guy's opinion with a web page," said Gibbs.
"Our external policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The American Government must demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Travers, an added director of the National Centre of Distribution against Terrorism, was appointed to be responsible, announced by the White House.
Thus, Travers is responsible for developing "the important reforms of them", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks' filtering.
The White House also wants to inspecte the paths, as well as to change the total information about the government and protect it.
Furthermore, the American government announced that to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, Wikileaks' publication should be in danger.
"We have done everything possible to contact them," said the portfolio of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to help protect them if necessary."
The Iron University
In the "Gelato" in Bolonia, irons are prepared in the best times of the year.
The basic course of three days for the future of yellows has the maximum affliction and visitors of the world.
Actually, where's the whole iron coming from?
The gelatine and the ice.
The gelatine designs crema is all the rules of the Italian art of the manufacturing of frozens.
The ice cream brings it out with a slip of the ice cream of the shower, spreads it over the ship and sells it.
To know this, it does not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bolonia.
But whoever wants to know more about frozens should not visit the "Gelato" of the Italian Carpigiani company.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice university with the congelator in 2003, so that the iron cream of its machines comply with the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course of three days for the future of yellows has the maximum affliction and visitors of the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate iron and practices in the iron of your own house.
In these crises, some dream with a new professional career, others risk the mild yellow of their vague desires.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passed by Hungary.
Jacky, teacher of this art in California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a European quality product in the land of industrial iron.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business adviser and wants to create something own in some years in a great work.
Two young Egyptians dream with opening a iron in Cairo.
A man in Malta and another in Brazil wants to improve the quality of the frogs of their bars, and a Canadian housewoman, Julia, comes because their children love the Italian frozens.
The yellow teacher Luciano Ferrari explains later to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect iron.
It is not only his good pleasure, but also his sorrowful mildness and good consistency.
Luciano doesn't live his training or her birth of the country's higher house and mainly from the south of the country: "The Italian ice is just the best, and therefore each ball has something romantic."
The first step to the design seems to be easy.
Luciano ejects the basic ingredients: milk, born, milk in powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large bathroom, which warms everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment heat it up to four degrees.
Then opens the griff of the machine and gets out a pasteurized white base cream, the base for all types of milk yellows.
Immediately, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be developed only with natural or without stalizer?
How can you give some kind of experience?
Luciano advises to dismiss the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of iron "not only of natural ingredients" has best used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guarn, of cold coal.
Of course, it can be developed iron without stabilising, only one day you need to buy it, place it in a bottle and the client will shoot a iron sound of grain.
Certain variables in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As regards the pleasure of ice, the teacher Luciano distinguishes the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit section or in the sweet of the supermarket.
And there are powder and powder.
"All suppliers will collect aromatized ingredients in their goods."
"And they should ever experiment."
Be with fruit sockets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream of the white basic mass, which with eggs will return a yellow cream and with cocao in dust as a basis for all possible chocolate pleasures.
Now the participants of the course can use helators.
Luciano allows them to prepare each time four different types of iron, chocolate, furnace and avellane, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less aroma of vanille or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with iron types of fruit.
Better knowing does not necessarily depend on having more aroma of tophe or more pure fruit.
It is not necessary that the iron of ovens know to dry fruits, if it contains more ovens.
The working group designs the iron worship of kiwi, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilising.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the iron saver, Luciano.
The preparation of frozens is a problem of arthetics: the pure melocoton with a lot of sugar is used, it must be decreased the proportion of sugar of the basic recept.
For limon iron, there is a additional part of sugar need.
Luciano takes an utility to fix the amount of sugar of fruit types (me of the viniculator for Oechsle in the wheat wheat).
Fortunately, tables facilitate the account.
Building iron is not more than physical application, as before.
Not only helps the tool for the automatic design of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, where the iron mixture is batched simultaneously and is cold at the lower temperature of zero.
Nevertheless, all automatication remains out of the small folder.
The Brazilian Gustavo is missing himself and his companions from up to down with pure fruit, as if it was a gigantic minipressure without control.
"In all courses," teacher Luciano, "is just a question of time that happens like this."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority of Efsa has been infiltrated in the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently formulated by the Group of Testbiotech experts, which is considered an institution for an independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems to be a conspiration theory but we haven't documented it well," Christoph then, director of Testbiotech, said on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, director of the Efsa Group experts on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert has also been contracted for years in the Illi association.
Consorties like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has worked significantly in the standards of Ephesus geneticly modified plants checking, which is situated in a clear conflict of interests, then criticises.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Illi and imitate the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It's the second time Testbiotech criticizes a collection of interests.
So recently, a high rango manager of Efsa was without support or transition time to Switzerland Agriculture Syngenta, and has changed its band with that.
Recently, the Centraldeutsche seeds (MDR) also reveal personal connections between EU inspection authorities and the industry, which have carried out the Environmental General Office as well as a EU parliamentary clearance.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interests.
All official data, including some of the industry, are repealed in a report where they are high and technical.
Experts who work in Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper supports its work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is called himself as a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policies, among others for the risk assessment of biotechnology without Lobby's response.
In this regard, independent experts, such as then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the impact of genetically modified plants in the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, makes the genetically modified milk in agriculture," -- Then.
Current practice consists of checking only proteins here, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how will you find?", asked, accused, then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
Scientific investigates the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works in the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, the industry is more, in the United States and in Europe, to influence or discredit the critical sciences.
Therefore, there are few scientists that are not affected by consorties.
For companies, critical studies are not published by general rule.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck maintains.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, totally about 400 kg.
On Monday was at Stuttgart's station, with the Tuba at the back.
There were manifestations
I don't know.
The story is known: In September the excava has arrived and began to throw a big piece out of the north ail.
The land of Stuttgart has never been the same again: Thousands and thousands have shown themselves against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As he was claimed, most of the walls are there.
Road in 6.000, 7.000 pieces.
́ilsheimer Muschelkalk, a brushed stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he's 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been assured.
"These stones are rest."
"You don't have to disappear."
It's enthusiasm: "A poor and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he said once, he's pulled the smoke of the cigarettes.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trace of Stuttgart's stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a previous depth of municipalities from the French Armageddon, where Manuel Rong built his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man treats old stones.
He bought everything that results from democracy in Stuttgart.
"It would have deceived, moleured the greenhouse or sent it to the bathroom," in his office, a wood box that once was a guard box.
He was insulted and threatened, explained, when in September he appeared in the journals, who had bought the rest of the northern ail to the trailing company.
He spoke to the enemies of 21S for several days.
And she explained that she couldn't do anything absolutely for the back.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable, when the stones followed you.
About 200 enemies of S21 took the low of 80 kg cut, with a price of EUR 6,50 to 14.
Some took it as a reminder, but also with the hope that it would be powerful in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a charge of 25 trucks.
Approximately half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold a long time ago.
Gardens of Garden, Paisage Gardener, responsible for projects.
They arrived everywhere, and they took what they could take to the maleter and upstairs.
Stuttgart's stone of the impulse has been converted to "the wall" or to the delimitation of Krä'beeten.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special." Rongen.
"If I wasn't by the political component."
He stands up to his whole earth, makes a tour for his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied the right, interrupted his studies, and later biologic, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's loving the stones.
Award to 4.000 tonnes of stone.
Transport your treasures throughout Germany.
It says to be the largest tractor of ancient stones in the country.
Frena.
In the snow there are picked aranistry arts.
"They belonged to Dresden Marienbrücke's bridge," he explains.
Blue calice, yellow, heat, if enthusiasm.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Sign a stone: Red Arenisca, a previous piece of Karlsruhe station.
And continue.
"Good cross."
Earlier the small ones belonged to the court of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, the yellow crossing of Stuttgart's police head, red greenty of the Church of Sankt Blasien, toba from Heilbronner's hospital.
What work, what effort, what sudor.
When Rongen thinks about how he smoothed the stones before and moved them with a simple appearance and a car, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something would be destroyed."
It has not been rich, absolutely rica.
But today 14 people have made the stone tractor, also songs, a sculper, a herd, a wine and a garden have been installed up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," the man who is responsible for using the rest.
You have to go to Colonia in a little while.
There are also stones to save.
Battle of talents around great potentials
Reignes an active affliction in the buffet.
16 students are stuck around the pans, the soap of tomates, and the sweet.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Vokswagen car manufacturer have invited a trainer to mechanical and design engineering students.
In a kind of concurrence of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also talk about Volkswagen.
Rivalising and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, are gathered in a body fight around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
His mission: To contract students with more talent from universities before they enter the work market and are contracted by others.
And since universities do not facilitate publications on the ability of their students, it is implied to address the talents in practical projects and to capture them.
The second project day at the Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium wins talents.
A lady of the Department of Staff distributes boligraphs, gomits and folders with VW logo.
Explain the illustrated young talents the practice programmes and works for students and show their ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Braunschweig Technical University carries the project with VW.
See advantages for both parts: "The students come into contact with the industry and ad · experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, observe more close to interesting candidates and consider them as possible future workers."
Some partnerships, says Selle, are not very common.
The newness is that students are so desired.
"The main point was previously located in the technical projects," Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates has become harder.
In many branches, enterprises can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
If they do not have to be announced and, in particular, to get a highly qualified work hand.
All students of engineering disciplines are in a great negotiation situation.
The German Engineering Association (VDI for its centuries in Germany) was held in October 40,000 vacant engineers.
And the VDI's predominants, this empty engineering will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dy is responsible for the chassing of talents.
He organizes costous contracting events, such as the KPMG carrier, a modern yincan, where participants have to find their path through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promised students to the U.S. next year.
Participants can also observe KPMG branches and observe the company.
Who should go in two choices in the output.
Only the cream cream of many participants is going to the United States.
Universities are more efforted to choose and clean the high potential of the universities, see Dy.
"We want to highlight the mass with the career."
"The simple trail for itself only remained short."
For the Dy cazatalents, notes give results.
"Today we have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
"Some are close to their end, and they want to ask to work with us,"
In addition to direct approach in the campus, they are also in the jail, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their feasts of work.
"We're trying to get students in specialized feasts."
"Nothing about Intersolar," -- Sitha Stübe, responsible for the Solar World Solar Technology Manufacturer.
Bonner has approximately 1.500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently on the company's web page, 35 vacant places appear.
"It's very complicated to fill the vacant posts."
"Keep a lot of time and money."
A shorter way is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld works with several high schools, for example the Freeberg University.
"Teachers advise that we can practice or perform their teases.
No public campaigns are performed for solar specialists.
Therefore, the company needs to promote with other advantages: personal environment, lasting hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A great consortium normally can't offer it," says Stübe, the staff charged.
In seeking a job, money is no longer the most important.
Decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children, or good opportunities to rise.
There is a study of the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld shows the 55th place among the 100 best employees in Germany.
The institution sets up an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For what the employer asks, I am satisfied with the work and environment in itself and observes the previous conditions of employees.
Stübe, the staff responsibility also expects extra points in its classification by its aspirants to work.
"I believe that the applicant is particularly fixed in the external classifications of an employer's potential."
Wolf Re日 Warler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want a long-term strategy that wins a good fame as employees.
Advise your clients more strictly.
And that means, if you're Kriegler, especially, internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as employee passes by its own employees," she assured.
In the branch of the sector it is called Employer Branding internal, also promoting corporate identity within its own template.
"A satisfied employee is the best ambassadors."
When people are good and identify it with the company, the employee is directly promoted by friends and friends.
"It's like a game with a pandilla," means Kriegler.
Obama holds new oil perforations
Since the coast of the state and of Florida to Mexico Golf, there has been no new oil perforation in these years.
The government of Washington issued a consensus and thus canceled its previous plans in an inappropriate manner.
The Atlantic coast also remains new perforations watched for the moment.
This announced the internal minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What caused this strict, at least the next five years, is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" oil platform in April.
Before the unfortunateness that costed the lives of eleven workers and caused the largest environmental disaster of the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new perforations in the western part of Mexico golf under pressure of opposition and industry.
Partidaries so wanted to reduce U.S. dependence on new oil supplys from the foreign.
Until today, it has not been declared of all who is responsible for the irreparable black sea in the golf.
In the center of the crisis, the British Energy Consortium BP is found, which is held with millions of requests.
A research committee responsible for Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the internal minister, raised the perforation moratory after explosion.
Later, different petroleum consortiums submitted applications for new perforation attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to reject a new disaster using more hard controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible control authority, who has been accused of corruption charges has fallen in discreditation, is reformed of root.
Obama announced parallelly that the profitable tax laguns for oil and gas consortiums will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that the total extraction in the golf will be less thanks to a stricter regulation until the date.
"The government's plans are the greatest frequency for the growth of oil and gas industry," says the result of the current survey carried out by the BDO adviser undertaking - before midnight's extraction.
American Energey Alliance is complained about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investment in new extraction projects is prolonged soon in growth loss.
Ogoniland is destroyed
The water of the rivers is oil marron, fleeing as a gasoline: Millions of crushed litres have destroyed the nature in the Ogoniland Nigerian Nigeria.
People live from stole, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari seems good.
"Don't quiet," the environmental activist calls the journalists: "Today it'll pass enough oil in your eyes."
The 37-year Nigerian has achieved photography of chicos walking in the water to the fat with the lights reflected in turbulences on the surface: With the colored water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not seen that on the surface floating petroleum marrons.
Before here, I took you to pumps, explains Esther Badom on the east of the River Bodo-Jetty.
Meanwhile, fluid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, a impressive quantity of oil became a road tuberculosis.
Fisheries around the small town of Bodo had to nail six hours to reach waters full of fish: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and in Ogoniland, is considered as one of the most deepest regions of the world.
In the way of the river river running through manglares, the destruction is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship’s engine removes a warm brun, who puts his hand in the water, will bring out some full of oil.
The roots of the trees of the manglars are up from the ground as dark rail, triumphedly issuing the palms that shock and cook their palms.
In vain, a band of birds are searched, as if they were in the humidal as always: As the outer barrier is quiet, there is a species of fantastic calm of an earlier paradise with gasolinery hole.
"What's happening here is a struggle for health," -- a cure, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger for health."
Continue the war comparison.
The area of the seat of Ogoni is a renewed battle field for years ago: here the first European explorators were broken over 60 years ago, here was organized the first resistance in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for petroleum employees.
Today, the return of companies to Ogoniland is still in the day: while they bombed more than two million black gold barriles every day from the whole delta region, three times greater than Switzerland, with more than 5.000 extraction sources and 7.000 miles of tuberculosis, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too instabil for consorcing.
Each two hundred meters sursaled steel platforms as water sculptures: "Birth Arbolites" called lovely to the heads of the perforators.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them present a total corruption.
Each instant fails a head, Achpobari, then runs a constant weeping of oil in the water.
The evaluations of experts have become more than two billion litres in 50 years in the delta eco: Year after year, the quantity of oil petroleum, such as the ship Exxon Valdez 21 years ago in the Alaska sea, one of the largest ecological disasters of the history of mankind.
Whoever is responsible for the duration of the environmental region, it will lead to it.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil robes are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, Others see the heads to break up and the tuberculosis with flights such as the main causers.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low security standards normally the conventional world, reproached scientist Richard Ste to the consortium in 2008: Only the defects of tuberculosis are "on a greater more than in another place".
In one place, which from far seems vivided, appears a full oil tolerant under the free sky, there are figures of the manglares: They are naked and oil-shirts.
Among one of the many barriles, which are sometimes united to perforations, sometimes arbitraryly spread on the ground, flame a fire: a small raffiny.
In the barril, the oil is warm in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First of all, gasoline passes through the tuberculosis in the recipient, later the oil tuberculosis goes and finally comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-liter diseal barriles daily: "Our delivers 34,000 naira", about 22 dollars.
The population of the delta benefits from the absence of fuel in one of the largest oil states in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and nice price of diesel only 40 centimeters per liter, illegal heatings can offer even less: so they reduce the value of their primary material.
It comes from "the bunkers" who called the tuberculosis network through Ogoniland: Experts are lost at least 16 million litres of oil daily in the whole delta of the Niger.

The Akpobari activist considers clearly academic the debate on whether the environmental disaster is better debt to the management of the population or to the floor of production.

Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in the A380 engines
It seems that A380 has a huge security problem.
In a survey of a machine that made a forced landing, researchers found a potential factory defect, which could produce "a disaster failure in the engine".
The Qantas line wants to ask the engine manufacturer.
The airbus passengers of Qantas who had performed a emergency landing at the beginning of November had much more lucky than that you could imagine: The Australian air security authorities realized a huge security problem in some A380, engines and warned about a possible factory deficiency.
The defect potential has complicated effects: In a connection of manguits, fat or grises can be caused, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophe error in the engine".
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 planes of the A380 series.
Among those who are located in the Qantas-Airbus who had to perform a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian line starts legal media against the British Turbine manufacturer.
He presented a request at the Sidney Federal Court that could have more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, manager of Qantas, declared that his line would comply with a compensation for the incidence of the beginning of November.
In the engine mark they have lost pieces and their wall is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines around the world must be relocated.
Australian investigators announced that they would perform more security tests to the supersubjects affected by the engines concerned.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, Martin Dolan, ATSB portfolio.
The security problem has become sufficiently important to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landscape of the Qantas device, the line holded its float A380 on earth for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines held approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on earth.
Airhansa rejected the engine of a A380 as a precautionary measure.
This biggest plane is the biggest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada throughout the country causes chaos in traffic
Germany totally white: From one day to another he has snowed in almost all the country.
In many streets, the chaos rules, the trains and the planes fall.
At least three people have lost life in traffic accidents.
The winter hile Germany: Almost all the country reached geled temperatures during Thursday's night, which has deceived chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and the east, there is a 15 centimeter snow layer.
Traffic is very limited in most autopaths and in many streets.
In the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the kitanieves are still working, removeing the new snow once and again, but it is not prepared.
Furthermore, strong wind races broke the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrography Agency of Germany (BSH) expects living marines with water level 1,2 metres above its normal level at the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Sajonia, snow accumulation caused significant problems in the roads and national roads.
The meteomedia service is held, the red warning is called in Sächsischen Switzerland, actually the highest warning.
There are partly 30 centimeters of recent falling snow and cold and strong winds are due to arremoline it.
There were many trucks and cars arrested during the night.
In Sajonia Anhalt, the police authorities also reported important destructions in the streets.
In the A2, snow and wind paralyzed the traffic and created attacks.
In Turkey, snows affected A4 and A9.
See Deutscher Bahn, great distortions are expected in Sajonia, Sajonia Anhalt, Turing and north of Baviera.
The snow on the road, the trees falling on the carriers or the destructed chain, and the snows are the main problems.
In Sajonia the interurban service of Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Turingia, a ICE train had to stop his travel to Munich.
The bombers and the salvation service had the 165 passengers in the train with lana, food, and drink.
The winds with snow break the streets.
In the largest German port, the winds with snow caused many flight suspensions.
A portfolio of the flight information centre has already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am, there are 40 flights cancelled from Fraport.
The remotanives are still working.
However, there are few passengers in the port, yet there are 400 campaign beds prepared for them.
In many streets, Wednesday afternoon, there were many accidents.
On the afternoon a truck died in a collision with a train on a road cross in Ostholstein.
The machine suffered light wounds.
In the nearby of Nuremberg, a similar accident occurred because of the snow streets: A truck was also reached in a road cross because the vehicle was attracted.
The driver lost life.
In the train four passengers were wounded, Bayreuth's resort to Nuremberg was locked for this reason in the morning.
Moreover, a 30-year-old woman died after giving a wind with his car near Aschaffenburg on a rebalading road.
They have a good news: the snow will be more slow and kind of powder, so it will be arranged in mild rains.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to do much cold, in some places to 15 degrees negative.
Godche Bank is looking for a buyer for his towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from his symbol: If a article is, the financial institution seeks a buyer for his office tours in Frankfurt's room.
The property could contribute to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank arranged his seat: Towers were modernized in Frankfurt's campaign; while the bankers returned to their former workplace.
But now the financial consortium is likely to benefit from the costs of recovery, and look for a buyer for the two races, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" is based on a portfolio.
The carrier does not designate the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether you should possess the properties or sell them and then get them back," he advised.
Therefore, Germany's largest credit institution rejects its company's seat after a short period.
The acquisition of the towers with a middle of 2007 by EUR 272 million from the investor of a household fund and then made its relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would provide a lot of money for the sale.
Experts in this area calculate the value of the magazine towers renamed as "Greentowers" in about 500 million euros.
If the renewable buildings are sold in a fund of the investor or to an independent investor are currently not discovered, the portfolio was advised.
Thousands of people fighting for dead mines
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought about the buried mines, which were given for dead after many explosions in a mine.
The provisions have not yet been found, since security measures are still precariate in the place of unfortunateness.
Nearly two weeks a intense explosion occurred in the Pike River mine near Greymouth town.
29 mines of age between 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A survey was introduced in the place of unfortunateness, but it did not discover any sign of super-economy.
As a result of the high concentration of toxic gas and continuous explosions, no salvation equipment could be reduced for security reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts devoted that there were no possibilities for minerals to be overcome.
The body could not be recovered until the date.
The family and friends currently correspond to the dead with a memorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with sunlight in Greymouth in the south-sealand island.
They're saving silence for two minutes.
In the homenage of the buried minerals, 29 tables were placed with the cocktails, lamps, and names of the miners.
There were also personal graphs and objects, under clothes and surf tables.
The flags had a middle to the governmental buildings of the country.
New Zealand hoped that mineros would return to the surface "of the depths of the earth," John Key, president of the New Zealand Government, said to the participants of the Memorial Act.
"But they never came home."
He can't assume the death of his son until he saw his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the President of the Government and the victims ' families, many foreign diplomatics participated in the Memorial Act.
In the first explosion, on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Saving workers started extinguishing a fire inside the carbon mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As explosive gases have been extracted, abrasive temperatures from the mine's interior will begin to descend, said Gary Knowles, the police's superior, to the journalists.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the kid get in the artistic movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn again explores the frontiers of the gender with his epopeia of battle "Walhalla Rising".
In what public would the Danish director Nicolas Winding Ref have thought when rounding "Walhalla Rising"?
A viking warrior captured with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost overhuman fights, sounds ideal for young spectators seeking bloody action, just because our heroe likes to use brutal methods to kill and throw his enemies the trips of their body with life when he is of bad humor.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, does not say almost any word during the whole movie and the other characters are allowed to carry out as much as one or two phrases or a couple of painful death cries.
On the contrary, they are silent and enjoying beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes, which the bastards offered to the world viking about a thousand years ago.
More ideal for growing and interested cinemates in existencialism and very quiet camera movements.
When a movie has several groups of players, it is a pen that cannot be rejected mutually.
The director Winding Refn considers his wilds and trilogia on the pillared "Pusher" drug trafficker as a Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but it is extremely refused to make their works for all publics with something more humor in the main or something less brutality of the art house.
A brain mass and some brotan trips cannot disown most of the artistic cinema followers.
The majority of the fans of the action are dead with disturbance, if Unojo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a series of violent Christian missionaries for interpretative reasons and a foreverity in the calm and naked before his team comes to America and rests back there.
It is a wound that "Walhalla Rising" hasn't found a cinematographic distributor in Germany and just be on DVD.
It's a calamity against wonderful images, but also because, after the presuntuous and bloody fascinated, a movie piece sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film doesn't handle dialogues or a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a febril dream transformed into movie.
And that's why there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn is only a moment of relaxation and its ice images and the low sound band of trance make him a nud in his garment, especially the incredible hate, which from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only a small young ruby, who supports Unijo faithfully, keeps something like innocentness, all others are possessed by anger.
In particular, the hero of one eye, whose reasons are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of the fire for enemies and provisional associates, perhaps the ambassador of the same devil.
It represents it, but maybe only for those who are lost in all ways.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious movie that can be hated and admirated, to be angry, changed and surprised.
A experience.
Mysterious land movements
The OIEA nuclear energy organisation has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country thinks about this topic until controls are allowed.
About the midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israelite fighting aircraft F-15 I attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located in the east of Eufrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 km is Dair as-Saur.
His name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (OIEA), regarding an reactor that, as a result, the Syrians built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley out of the river.
Information about the U.S. International Intelligence Service at the end of April 2008 is designed by a running reaction under the name of the Kibar closests of the plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are built.
Instead, the technology serves only for other purposes than for those of the fifty years.
The ≥ showed a video presentation with clear satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reaction components were before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the Northern Korean model of Yongbyon's nuclear central.
They also learned graphs that showed the building from nearby or from inside.
It was a little while the reacter was working, says, but he was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later from the bombarder, it is just more known than then, the enigmes were made older with time.
The former president of the United States, George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that before the attack, the Syrian was fully sure that they had built an reactor in Kibar, but that only saw indications that there was "a nuclear weapons program in the country".
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more advanced and only speak of a "subordinate reaction", even though they consider "plausable" the presentation of the.
They miss strong tests, as well as the OIEA.
When you were asked how sure it was to have before a reacter, a high VN diplomatic answered in a summer rocky way that the OIEA had "adequate material to have questions".
The Syrians were very quickly dismissed from the presence of "unused military building" and extended the territory to consciousness.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an OIEA team under the command of the former Chief Inspector O Heinonen found urinary races in the Kibar, which had been produced by people.
Furthermore, the OIEA received satellite images on a Member State, of commercial sellers at the moments right after the attack, which must have a higher information value than the presentation.
However, these graphs did not come to the market because a unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them in a way.
Therefore, the OIEA cannot check its integrity independently.
Syria always understood that he had never had a secret nuclear programme or built any reacter.
Uranium came from the Israelites' weapons, explained ́cus.
The OIEA is inverosimil after the analysis of the particules.
Since then, it has been refused to discuss it, as well as satellite images.
Furthermore, controllers are prohibited a second inspection in the Kibar and the entry into the ruins of the bombarded building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"Nothing will we say," Ehud Olmert, Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, confirmed recently the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not resulted since June 2008 and "is progressively transformed into a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as a west diplomatic of high charge corresponds to a place in the OIEA in Vienna, finally a serious violation against the treaty of non-proliferation of atomic weapons, which the OIEA sees.
The OIEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in the clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the presumed reaction, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not communicated publicly until the time when the teams are treated, whether they have functions, or whether they seem suspicious.
The Southdeutschen Zeitung magazine is designed by the OIEA as inside Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again resulting from the neighborhoods of the cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and locali; a compound of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Perhaps it is on or immediately next to a military basis, Syria prohibits the entry into the three places to the OIEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the United States have requested the OIEA to spy military plants.
Nuclear detectives were warned about equipment thanks to the warnings of the U.S. Secret Service.
Through satellite graphs, the OIEA has evidence that it is materially followed between the three places and the cube at the east of the Eufrates.
A west diplomatic with a high charge in Vienna suggested that at least one of the teams could be "related with fuel production".
However, there is "no indication of sensitive activities" or of uranio or reconditioning; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reaction is ≥ with urian that is not rich.
Where the uranio should come from and where the plutonium should then be separated for bombs, for these central questions, there are, in the best of the cases, pleasable suggestions.
There is no doubt whether ruins, valuable tracks that can be recovered, are located in the three places.
As the hundreds of charges of the carriers in the ground disappeared, no one has information about where the shops remain.
The OIAE considers unlikely the al-Tibni salt mine, which was in the few kilometers from Kibar to the other part of the Eufrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for their capacity as a area for radioactive residues.
Recently, Robert Kelly, OIEA's previous inspector, related to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, the graphs from the orbite show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the OIEA requested the entry.
It can be as if it is but it only contributes to discern the suspect.
Furthermore, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the OIEA has used a few months to develop a plan of inspection, which the Syrians will allow, to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the interest of inspectors.
Meanwhile, it also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomatics in Vienna a year ago have been calm with that the reacter was already destroyed, so the issue has not been very urgent for a few months ago, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, writes the calling inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, director of the OIEA, who should propose these inspections, has spoken of "a option to which I am open in the future", but still empty.
This path is very dangerous: for this the majority of the OIEA Government Council is needed, and some of the 35 representative countries there are not exactly anxious for a scale.
On the other hand, as a diplomatic reflected, "What if they find nothing?"
Love in Wartimes
There are problems since Angelina Jolie eats in summer with its debut address yet without name.
She wrote the script, a story of love between a bosnia and a Serbian.
You do not know much more about this, but this is enough for agitation.
The voice is very persistent, the woman, the Muslim, loves her serb violator during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosnish women's associations have quickly protested, and at the last time they have followed a few days of roads planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been rounded in Hungary and postproduction, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the female war victims organization wrote to the United Nations High Commissioner, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the activity, informed a Bosnian magazine, Jolie is the ambassador of the United Nations High Commissioner for the re-edicted.
It's not diplomatic, women offered him a meeting in Hungary that is ↓ weeks ago.
The meeting occurred in Bosnia, Hasecic.
Love stories are not given in violations fields, and Jolie's position regarding victims is enough about the script.
His organization, in accordance with the United Nations High Commissioner for Reformers, has recommended that Jolie be established as an ambassador, inform the Guardian.
But what did Jolie write exactly for the scenes?
The Ministry of Bosnish culture that read the script, traveled behind a tour and dealed with a permission in Sarajevo, it is not clear why Jolie did not have been at all.
The young author recalls that he does not pursue political purposes with his film, is a great effort in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains unexpected.
In the network a second synopsis of the movie that sounds very different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and returned to meet when she, a Muslim bosnia, is sported to a Serbian field where he works as a guardian.
What seems to be different is the variant of violation victims loved by torturing.
Jolie's movie really starts before war.
The pressure on her, Jolie, is "injust and based on wrong information".
Now you can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script continues illegally on the network, as many others earlier.
Nothing remote from here
This afternoon, finally, it's going to be good for the Irish.
No trace of distress
Instead, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans cry out of joy when he grabs high music, swallows the ground with his feet.
The Bailey club vives in the Southern Cork, because players running, and find, beer bottles from a distance of three meters
The strange spectacle is called Beerpong, and the premium for the winner is 500 euros more aeroplane to Las Vegas for the world beerpong campaign in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type, this extravagant drink game and the informatic discretion actually doesn't make good mixtures.
And the 26-year-old boy's fun with that, distraction from the luminous question, what will the future be with him.
The entertainment in Las Vegas is not in its plans, in January will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad presentation."
"It's very far from home and I don't have work there yet."
At least: Your girlfriend waits for you in Auckland, "of a shooter has been able to do his dreams as a event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad perspectives at home, two of the three Tanners brothers have already looked for happiness in the foreign.
His sister Yvonne, a social work, is in Sidney, his brother Colin currently works as TI adviser in London.
Young people go: In the island there are many families like the Tanners.
1000,000 Irish will leave the country in a nearby future, pronounce experts in economics and the ESRI social research institution of Dublin.
Up to 2015, 200,000 immigrants are counted.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
Prognoses are confirmed, a comparable hole is coming to which the island suffered in the eighteen years.
After a decree of progress that brought a great well-being to the Irish, the melancholia is currently extended.
The economic crisis confusions the young, well-formed Ireland, for those who are still covered up.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three of each ten men and women less than thirty years are in the park.
In the Irish Times, there are letters to the director in mass of young immigrants, which are complained that "In Ireland everything is hungry."
"It should be a rise against politicians and bankers, but whoever can go and lose our country, and with that a whole generation."
"The last one who closes the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a legal student and president of the Irish Student Union, will appear a shameful future because the government is devoted only to mounts and no longer offers future perspectives to young people.
"Reduce minimum salaries, but they have no strategies to achieve new jobs," the 20-year-old girl.
Note how their companions go from non-reunification practices to the following.
His greatest concern, explains, is to emigrate for four years.
"This idea is sad and deprived."
People like Stephen McLarnon have a positive view of this topic.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a ferry that offers a return service to the theme of work in the foreign.
"For those who start working, doing it in the foreign is a great opportunity, the first steps to drive your career," the manager.
On your website, photos of a boy practicing surf in ↓a and another practicing snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working in the foreign is not like to do it in the gallers, unless it is free and entertainment.
Sean O'Donovan knows how to build something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to do for 29-year-old engineer, currently working with 15 Irish companions in the building in Germany.
Now they arise a mode tent in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his patriarch only few times because he works extra hours to be able to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," since a long time ago, the first time he was throwing the shadow of his house.
"I get money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
Something is ridiculed and goes through iron rooms.
The small house is in a elegant residential area with care of gardens in front of the houses, in the entrance are stored large and dear cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with her sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent financed by a credit.
"There were crazy times, there were easily money without many questions," he said.
Are you afraid to fail the credit?
O'Donovan thinks a little, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything comes wrong, I can start from zero."
Civil engineer doesn't like the claims that often listen.
"No one must pass hunger, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in times past here on the island."
"Doing a season in the foreigner is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps with that we feel for the first time as Irish."
He rided and reported about his father, that in the last large economic crisis he went to England.
" After seven years, he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Let the future stumble and just see how life is elsewhere.
He's been working for a few years in London, and why wouldn't he go well to him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But in these days there is something that concerns you about overcoming: celebration of its 27 birthdays on Friday in Dublin.
I'm afraid I can degenerate at a breakfast party.
"Only, not too much emotion," he says and gives a bird a bird.
"Despedid, it sounds very embarrassing."
"We better call her a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
The support for democracy in Latin America continues to be increased, as well as support for private companies.
Crime generates greater concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in large part of the region, Brazil is viewed as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latin barometer last investigation conducted in 18 countries and published by The Economyst.
Since the investigation has been held regularly since 1995, it allows monitoring the changes in the region.
In the results of this year ' s investigation, held in September and October principles, there are two related issues.
The first is the humor’s encountered rulership in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of democracy and its main institutions.
The support to democracy has increased consideration in various countries of South America's coast (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached a average of 6% annual since 2002, democracy support has increased from a decrease of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
He also grows in Mexico, where the economy has been recovered after suffering a great decrease in production last year.
However, only half of the surveys in Mexico and Brazil, the two most popular countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which reduce the regional average (see graph 2).
Approximately 44 per cent of the surveys in the region were declared satisfying the way democracy works in practice in its country, the same number as last year, but considers more than 25 per cent registered in 2001 (graph 3).
Approximately 34% suggested that they trusted in the Congress of their country and 45% in their Government, the same amount as the last year in both cases, but considers it higher than 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
Economy turbulences in Latin America have severely affected the support of democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the world financial crisis is probably due to many Latin American countries only affected by a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Furthermore, the existence of a stronger social security network has contributed to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America informed this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in the conditions of poverty only in 2009 and that it has been reduced to 32% again this year.)
However, the state of encouragement was considered different from one country to another (see graph 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of its outcome president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and have increased violent crimes.
Secondly, since the investigations started, most questioned in Latin America mentioned crime instead of unemployment, as the most serious problem of their country (see Figure 5).
Approximately 31 per cent that, whether they or a nearby parent, the crime has been victim in the last year, a number that has been reduced from 38 per cent of the past year and that is the minimum percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic results are reflected in a greater support for private companies and market economy: approximately 71% of the researchers in the region are that private enterprises are essential for development, while in 2007 only 56% (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58% agrees that market economy is the only system that will allow its country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of Venezuela's investigators are thinking the same (and 80% support private companies), although their representative Hugo Chavez is the islandist, is providing a number of private companies.
Brazil is the country who exercises a greater leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of the investigations (about 18% the past year), followed by the United States (9%, the same number as last year) and Venezuela (9% before 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the most influential country of the investigations in Mexico and most of the Central America, while Venezuela shows that title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Selection to Wastebasket
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they passed far worse than the foreigners who helped the country to remont after their problems.
The votes were introduced in the urnes, some people voted several times, papers in the halls, devastated electoral colleges and intimidation acts.
Electoral colleges opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups moved by the earthquake of January, walked through the area to find out where to vote.
Some of them, finally, were won by vengeance.
A dozen of candidates to the presidential, including several of the most popular, claimed fraud and requested the cancellation of elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the United Nations biggest rango officer in Haiti, declared that they were "good elections in many ways."
The observers of the United States and the Caribbean Community have cautioned that "we do not think that these irregularities, for seriously, are necessary to invalid the process."
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The electoral authority, which is responsible for its controversy, is committed to René Preval, the immature outstanding president, and with its candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The outcome is expected to be carried out in January.
Not all hopes have yet been lost in relation to elections.
The two main candidates to the opposition, Michael Martelly, a reporter, and Mirlande Manigat, a former lady, have recovered its initial request in which they requested the invalidation of the vote.
But there can still be problems if the electoral authority states that Mr. Célestin, who only has support, if you have any, has passed to the second round.
Taking into account that the cholera epidemic swifts the country and more than one million earthquake survivors still live in tents, a great abstention is expected.
At the time, many haitians wanted to vote, but they did not succeed because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents needed to vote have been distributed shortly before elections.
There's a lot in the game.
Assistance donors believe that the election of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the rebuilding of Haití.
And, if it's been a patent, the Haitians also think it.
Progressing points towards the centre
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the President of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy between the public who has increased its popularity at 20 points, up to 50%, the highest level he has registered since its election in 2007.
Nevertheless, that can make it a successful campaign for a second mandate in the elections of the next year will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernández leaves the integrity of her dead husband, her preacher and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And at this point, the indications are not concluding.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to carry out economic policy even after his wife had occurred to him as a president, had the custom of developing budgets that infravalued tax income, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to expenditure additional incomes to their discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority at the Congress last year.
However, opposition is divided, a situation that has deteriorated after Kirchner's death because of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some disrespecting members of the peronist movement in power have been held to Mrs. Fernández.
Nevertheless, after some caotics, where a Member gave one to another a puppet in the face and other Members accused the Government of Soborn, the Congress decided to take the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to discuss," said the President.
The budget of 2010 will therefore be applied to the next year, which will offer the President an even greater amount of action than the time of expenditure.
Economy is improveing considerate: probably grows up to 9% this year.
The rate of official inflation is currently at 11.1%, but many private estimates, as well as the salary requirements of the syndicates, are situated at approximately 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who adopted the power in 2003 when Argentina was at the border of the economic collapse, made the growth and reduction of poverty its priorities instead of inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the FMI, pressed the private sector and made the INDEC, the statistical institution, adapting official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now modify these policies?
He has gathered meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the universities.
Furthermore, their officers want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been emphasized by the high prices of the argentin agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited the impulse to growth achieved with a great devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for reason, Mrs. Fernández is giving signs to want to restore Argentina's financial links with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the Government reached an agreement with the debt holders who had refused a forced reverse of the debt that Argentina had not subscribed in 2001.
Currently, Mrs. Fernández seems to conclude an agreement with the creditors governments grouped in the Paris Club, which has about $6.700 million.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve FMI's supervision, as often being usual.
However, last month, the Minister for Economics, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund would offer "technical assistance" to develop a new price for national consumption, which seems prelude to INDEC.
It is not clear that President Fernández wants to continue in the policy when it is completed, taking into account that she has no husband anymore.
If you do so, you will need to win the support of the average class, a large part of which the chirchnerism has lost.
When the soldiers return from their staff vacuations in March, the sympathy hole for her will be lost.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not, with quietness, many of your husband's policies.
Average wurm by China
The voters of Taiwan are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about his great brother on the other side of the street?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the electoral, arrived on 27 November to elect five-thirds and concealers, as seems to be a broad evaluation of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma has turned back a defensor of feelings by the continent, providing innovative business connections, including a free trade agreement, the major changes in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but shortly.
Although its Kuomintang party (KMT) had finally won three of the five elections at alcalde, he did not get most of the votes.
Instead of it, the Democratic Progressist Party (PPD), which has been drawn up by a total independence of Taiwan, obtained nearly 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If they had been the presidents, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since two years ago, the proportion of votes of its party has decreased about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD paid KMT at the meetings.
The elections could see the typical elements of the Taiwan elections, including rude campaign trucks and large agglomerations with banders and light dancing clothing girls.
Nothing was missing the mysterious intention of rigor killing.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of KMT, was campaigning for one of KMT candidates night before elections.
A man of the multitude shot the young man directly to the face, led him and killed a transaction.
Interestingly, it was not possible to determine whether the man wanted to hurt Lien or recompense from the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, has affected the elections, sowing suspects on the PPD and providing the voters to be inclinated by the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was amazing that the issue of the continent was not being addressed in itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public accommodation plans and job creation.
Thaiwan normally enjoys its fact independence and hates China's military threat.
Hence, the KMT often avoids giving publicity to its links to the Government in Pekín.
But this time the PPD also avoided strengthening the feeling against China.
Answers to the new conscience that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic superficiality.
On its part, Mr Ma acknowledged that it had been confirmed that its policy on China was acceptable for most Thaiwanians.
The Government of Pekín is expected to continue to overcome them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to achieve that Taiwan returns to the road.
China did not lose time by sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summary on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
It would certainly like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
It will be the best to expect that the presidential elections of 2012 pass for it.
In any case, the PPD has recovered.
Two years ago, he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was arrested for corruption.
The Chairman of 2000 to 2008 urged openly the explicit independence.
However, under Mrs. Tsai's leadership, a new generation of moderates has occurred and the PPD is trying to attach professionals and young people.
Mrs. Tsai has been welcomed as the PPD candidate for the Presidency, as well as its Tseng-chang, who has fulfilled the mandate under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything possible by demonstrating that you can also have relationships with Peking.
Mrs. Tsai announced the creation plans of a group of experts acting as a point of contact between PPD and China, provided that negotiations without previous conditions can be carried out.
Mrs. Tsai says to the Taiwan public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's predicted approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious for the change.
In a statement issued from its cell, he suggested that the PPD candidates would have been better stopped if they would have insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even commanded Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to present to the presidents.
Even without interviewing Mr. Chen, the PPD will have difficulties to choose among its possible candidates.
KMT must also make a conscious examination.
Mr. Ma's assessments have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be primarily due to unemployment and growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT portfolio that will re-reserve its office, as well as local equipment.
The major PPD samples suggest that Taiwan's support to a closer is limited.
At the same time, most Thaiwanians believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
See Antonio Chiang, a known colonist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Names to the Grammy: the jazz Spalding song is the surprised choice in the Category of Artist Revelation.
He acts at the request of a president and probably people will be fixed in you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year jazz bathroom, personally selected by President Obama to act in its ceremonie of the Nobel Prize of Peace in 2009, subjected one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level nomination in the Best Artist Category.
Taking into consideration that Spalding has been a claimed jazz figure since 2008, "Hope", the nomination of what to think, but he respects the Grammys' standards if it must be a artist who has not taken more than three albums on the market before he "determines the public identity of that artist".
Its ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society", without doubt suggested a great advance and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great ability with pop influenzas and latin ryths, at least a distinction between Spalding and the path to the success of Norah Jones in 2003 can be established, the nearest equivalent for the Grammys voters, which recently have been concentrated on the jazz area for this category.
In the rest of the categories, the voters of the Grammy honored "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio, an exciting and magnified disc that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors, the saxophonist James Moody is a saxophonist with "Moody 4B" and John Beasley technist by "Positootly".
Trombone Shorty, a favorable strident in New Orleans and usually invited to "Treme", of the HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which is for the rest attached to the fusion as in the Stanley Clarke albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society had a deserved recognition in the category of large groups, counting against Billy Childs' large jazz camera jazz and always risked Dave Holland, whose album is alive with its oct, "Pathways", was a great example of the democracy leadership of the bathroom in his band.
Grammy premium names: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums

The proposed mixture in Temecula receives the approval of the Order Committee
The draft mexican for Temecula has obtained a single support from the local order committee after more than five hours of public witnesses, often accumulated.
Critics attacked the project by promoting terrorism and attacks.
However, the members of the committee decided on midnight that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from the steady point.
"Multiful people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or the Great, of all religions," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre of the Temecula valley, said on Thursday morning.
"The truth is that, as a American citizen, I am proud."
"Shows that it overcomes justice."
"The opposite is really less," adds.
"Only they're talking very high."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The empe held at the sixth of the afternoon and lasted almost until halfnight; most of the time were dedicated to people who interceded in favour or against the center, almost the same amount on each side, is the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"United States doesn't exist anymore", read in one of the comments.
"It's another Sime Planet with Mrs. Freedom dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Construction plans of islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero area, the area of New York, where attacks were held on 11 September 2011.
In the Temecula Valley, the Mahmoud Harmoush imman has declared violence acts.
His nearly 135 families congregation has spent years with no problem in the Riverside condate, but he wanted a greater and better space than the storage that was acquired in a property with a manufacturer of water filtering systems.
The new mixture of 24.943 squared feet, with a mediterranean architectonic style, would include two minarets and would rise up to the 43 feet.
There would be a surface of 4.32 acres in Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral institution.
The opposers can still repeat the project before the municipal Council.
A arsenic resistant microbial provides the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or in other places
The discovery of a strange teria that can use the arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new ways of life on Earth and, possibly, on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curiosity here on Earth, they say that it shows that there are ways of life without the main elements they considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"You can grow with phosphor or arsenic."
"It becomes something very particular, although you need little to be a kind of life really 'aliengena'," commented Paul C. W. Davies of the Arına State, with the report that appears in the e > online on Thursday of the Science publication.
Since a long time, it is considered that there are six main elements for life: carbon, aluminium, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor and sugar.
However, researchers have deceived that the teria in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after submitting the phosphor for the arsenic.
"It makes you wonder how much more possible it is," said Ariel D. Anbar of the Air State State, with the report.
Anbar indicated, the finding is important for life search on different planets of the Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, know the aspect you have.
The study is focused on a missing microbi on Earth.
However, the convocation of a press routine to discuss it, in which no detail about discovery was spread, generated a huge speculation on the Internet on the possibility of the report to indicate the discovery of alien life.
He didn't.
The discovery "yes shows that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to impulse their biochemics and that the set of elements that we consider to be indispensable for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, Cathedral of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open®, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of a element for each other in the biochemical and basic biochemical," added Cockell.
The discovery has not been performed by case.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high arsenic levels.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from the chemical point of view, so it speculated that a microbial exposed to both could substitute one another.
"The arsenic is primarily toxic because its chemical behaviour is similar to the phosphor."
"Consequently, it may be complicated to the different organisms."
"But, the arsenic is a lot different as to not work as well as the phosphor, so it comes in and, in some way, calls my biochemical architecture," explains Anbar.
Researchers collected known theteria as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to more concentrations of arsenic, which were achieved to be adapted and used to grow.
The microbio grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic in its place is the possibility of naturally existing a lifestyle that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or in another planet or moon where the arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, microbiology assistant teacher in Florida, indicated that the idea that the arsenic can be suspended by the phosphor is not new, but has never been found an example that shows that it works.
The arsenic was the most common in the first ears of the Earth, so researchers indicated that the first ways of life could have used it.
"If it suggests that there could be other means to generate life, not only the way life was shaped in the ancient Earth," Foster indicated that it was not part of Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by the NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
The stolen dogs missing Compton have been found
The two dogs missing the four stolen in front of the Bellflower motel have been found, the officers of the sheriff of Los Angeles County on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Gales Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in 2006, where they were going on the night, before Bellflower Motel 6, were signed by the authorities.
Two of the caninos were recovered Wednesday afternoon, and the rest of the two were found on Wednesday after night, and Steve Whitmore, a portfolio of the sheriff's office of Los Angeles, was informed.
"The good news is that dogs are well," Whitmore advised.
"They're in good state."
"They've flighted with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore didn't want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which boat, nor the circumstances of discovery.
"There's conducting an investigation."
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore advised.
"We're following some tracks."
Couldn't find dog owners, Christina Rickard and David Peek, to make some comment on Thursday.
They meet with their two Akitas in a repository of animals from the conde in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the car and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a dog of 3 years, and Didi, a dog of 10 months) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis who Rickard and Peek intended to show in the competitions of the area this week in the name of the Japanese dog owners, they were still disappeared until midnight.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukanuba national campaign this weekend and were intended to show Trace.
The other dogs would show them in other competitions scheduled for the days before the AKC/Eukanuba campaign, Peek to The Times was indicated on Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops in the nearly two months tour that make the couple participating in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard did the check-in in the motel.
They are usually in motels and park the truck right in front of the window of their room.
There were three other dogs (a boxer crew, a ter parson and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the furniture because they had a very thirsty puzzle and would be fresher.
They left windows lightly open so that dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard announced the furnace's robe on Tuesday at six of the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a re-eye to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, microchips to identify them.
Thursday wasn't clear whether a ree would be given or not.
The lion is ready to rise again, while MGM's repeat gets the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally achieved green light to start again.
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Justice of New York officially adopted the "pre-armad" plan by the creditors to remove approximately 5 billion dollars of debt, extending the way to focus on the 86-year enterprise company on its efforts in the production and outer films and television programmes.
Thursday's failure confirms that the plan fulfils the needs of the Code of Road and Roger Birnbaum, so there are no other legal obstacles that MGM retreat under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 integrants.
In fact, MGM will not exit chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument to finance the operations and production of the new MGM.
The investment is currently syndicating the loan, which is contributing to 75 million dollars, and it is expected to be financed at midnight of December.
The review process of study eats in May 2009, when the Moelis and Co. investment was contracted to give advice on the management needed to order their funds, while he was fighting to make interest payments for $300 million per year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert in the recovery of cheap companies, known by his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial distress and to satisfy more than 140 students needed much more time of expectation.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company on sale at the end of 2009.
However, the substate attached a few posters and no dispute to pay the more than $2 billion who were seeking creditors.
Before this year ' s firstborn, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began to work in a re-re-re-work plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally supported by the creditors for the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves the route in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multimillionary bonifications for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received 1.2 million dollars, will receive a payment of 9.5 million dollars.
Cooper's companys, who have collected $375.000 per month for their company administration services, will receive 4 million "success honors".
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to renew production in MGM, which just stretched one movie this year, and gathered a yearly seven or eight films that will go out in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The study needs to concert a separate loan from $265 to $275 million to finance its part of those two movies, which will be addressed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM debt, was trying to fix a combination of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the biggest debt.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance of your budget for gifts
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful game of this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant meal in your budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of a iPad, five BMX bicycles can be purchased by 99 dollars each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic hours added with accounts, or approximately 48 sides of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget for equilibrium gifts.
Recently I visited three national players, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic players could buy at least 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that the Law of Moore has been working; the technical game of this year will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to the last year.
Moreover, while there are generally less new games with associated websites, two of the most familiar of this type, Webkinz and Penguin Club, have more offers.
And games impulsed by button piles are growing, as well as players with reloadable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and more) are peak games of the size of a cobaio that sing a note when their barricades are covered.
A presson is equal to a note, and a second presson starts to weaken a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Precaution: When it starts to stick, it can't stop.
For the amount combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60 dollars, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking delivery from Elmo Live technology last year, the Animal Munich of 14 pounds plays turning games like Simôm Dice, and can make the moon step, thanks to its innovative feet with wheels with blocking devices.
Children who tried the game used Mickey as a dance teacher, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a kid of the 80s, you can remember Al ́e, one of the first computerized educational games.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, 40 dollars, for 3 years and more), with a mouchle full of letters designed to convert a car passenger to a session with an emergency autocorrection exercise.
If you are reluctant to give your child your smart phone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
MobiGo of VTech (60 dollars from 3 to 8 years) is the most beautiful and easier to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; even though games do not learn so effectively as the Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, 3 to 12 years), is the first point of Leapster line, with a newer and pending screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
iXL de Fisher-Price (90 dollars, 3-7 years old) use a iTunes type system to present games and electronic books, and has a SD card random that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a five-blocks-screen game only bigger than a circle box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to weaken words by putting blocks in line before the time ends; it is amazing for an improvised competition of weapons of words.
They are more players who have some kind of online connection.
Only based on your presence on games, the two largest are Webkinz and Penguin Club.
To buy your son a online mascot in the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack (5 dollars, 6-12 years old) which includes a currency with a hidden code.
When you change the online code, your child gets enough credits in the Penguin Club store for two articles.
These could include pairs on wheels or a mask Puffle player.
Lightly bigger than the grid of your teeth cup, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last in a row of microrobots impulsed by button pills.
The insect moves quickly over 12 foots of silicone that live in random directions.
It's fun to make a block lab to see if you can find output.
It's also durational.
Our was able to leave the table of the kitchen and even to pass a mouse in our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of order maintenance in China is promoted
As a city instructor Sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the step on a place of the city, insighting the nervous people in his charge, emitting low voice orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the police officers of the city order in China, feared and disturbed by their caprichous energy measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a set of spectators.
Signs!
"Attence!"
Show them, he shout, "How are the beautiful girls!"
Four girls who only passed the adolescence with white gums and similar green cups and bags adapted to call attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant shadows placed perfectly above the hair attached with white and white wheels.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, deafly.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to guard the image of the town inspectors in China.
One city ordered all new recluses to have a degree title.
The Guangdong Province changed the green color of the uniforms to a pretty attractively more attractive.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced the use of force by intimidatory looks: in 2009, it was a report, 50 officials rounded to a district road of snacks, and observed it constantly frozen for a half hour until the walking seller collected his things and left.
Xindu, a 680,000 town inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, 13 women have been elected by their appearance, proportion and youth have joined their city police.
The idea is to give the police a sweeter side, woman.
Sorry, up to Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's increasing respect for these scenarios of the city.
And for a good reason, the critics would argue.
In contrast to the police, these officers are authorised only to carry out the orders of the city, imposing bills and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media turn routinely off a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the Province of Hubei killed a transaction after using their cell cells to film them while solving a protest against a retreat of waste.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors in Pekín was hurt and published on the Internet, in which it was described as azotar effectively to criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a walking Shanghai sandy salesman suffered brain damage after a nine with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for online, presents inspectors trained by Chinese who attack travelers.
"Chengguan has left a cicatriz in the government," the Chinese Daily, a national publication, was regreted last year after another controversy on tactics.
The newspaper said "a really meticulousness".
The skeptics say that the current approach is very far from this.
After the demand of a 8 new female reclame in October, a editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real duties or were just a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a little of both things.
The warning of the demanded female candidates from 18 to 22 years of age, with a good figure "and the five harmonious face races".
They should have a height above the average, over 1,6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 pounds.
Return to the age of 26 is mandatory.
The officers said that the work was physically too heavy for women with more than 25 years.
"Your image is the important thing," said a anonymous officer at Rednet.com, a web site of governmental cuasi.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, face races, etc.
Then the temperature "and the internal qualities" comes.
Shenggan women are like flowers, said, and he aggressed, "Unless they are flowers, they will have other responsibility."
Zheng Lihua, subdirector of the town administration office of the city, is not anxious to support that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese work warnings for both sex.
Then comes the need for harmonious face races.
If this means to be appealed, it is a matter of debate between Chinese.
The negative or disfigured should certainly not be presented.
"We can't let a kitchen or a jorobado come to work here," Mr. Zheng said.
"Your picture wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who watches the Baoguang Plaza near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colored shoes and a mouth subtlely curve.
She doesn't think the accent in her appearance is sexy, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" asked he with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old worker, Xu Yang, said, "Our work must present the image of the city."
They also do not oppose their work at a time, they said, because they cover greater career ambitions than simply helping sellers in the roads where they are supposed to compete their business.
Each morning, the squadron is more or less than a dozen walking sellers that swallow up or in bicycle, trying to sell as many tofu pancills or tazones as possible before it is cast.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
"We have told you many times!" said Miss Xu while a seller was running away, temporarily abandoning his car driving by bicycle with credit garnitures.
The officers describe their duties as most monotons than aggressors.
"This is more or less the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20 years old, who studied marketing in his free hours.
"More rutinary."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male homologs to confiscate the sea of sellers.
They can only threaten the offenders to their men's overseers.
This aims to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, were moved after the sound that some Chengguian officers had killed a seller.
More than a dozen of the police or officers of Chengguan were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were volcated or captured.
Now Xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm is only guaranteed.
Only on two roads of the passive Plaza Baoguang, where women's officers patroled that morning, more than 50 people gathered themselves in a sea.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the steel rather than in a taller, as the regulation requires.
The owner of the moto claimed greatly.
The situation stood for 15 minutes before the officers, with bad face, went to the cups to their vehicles and were quickly with the motorcycle and their owner.
Li Xuedong, 40-year-old, a coordinator assigned to the man's squadron, stayed behind, with his white sign returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, 40-year-old men, play a pure support role.
In contrast with them, they are not trained to keep an elegant image.
Sometimes we fight verbally.
"We sometimes fight physically," Mr. Li said totally naturally.
"The majority of the time is the public who starts the fight."
Taxers will not be charged against Senator Ensign
The Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that the taxors of the Department of Justice have excused Senator John Ensign of the criminal imputings that came from her business with a former campaign assistant and their efforts to ensure work through lobby for the woman ' s husband.
The decision ends with the more serious legal threat than the Ensign, the Republic of Nevada, which was considered as a possible presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal on its business had national holders last year and harmed its career.
The Ensign office said he felt "safely satisfied" by the decision, which came after a whole year investigation.
The Senator could still take a disciplinary measure of the Senate Ethics Committee.
The lawyers of Ensign said that the Department of Justice had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his research and that he has no plan to make charges against him for this issue."
The Department of Justice did not want to make comments on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice, which said that it seemed to have significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have confusioned to violate a federal crime on lobby.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first distributed in October 2009 in New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of its assistants, to gain profitable work through lobby, to achieve Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, about the business of the senator with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasury of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign was contacted with several political patrocinators to find Mr. Hampton's job and advocated on behalf of them after they had contracted Mr. Hampton to make lobby for them, the documents and interviews are held.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, it was excluded if the law to make lobby for his former employer or Senate for a year.
The ethical experts said that the inu arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were intimate friends before the business, appeared in disappointment with the name "revolving door lobbying ban" that seeks to restricte that former public employees use their connections to make personal business.
From the evidence that it has been made public, "he seemed to be a primary case face of a conspiration to substantive violate the revolving door status," Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington specialised in defense of customers investigated by the government.
While the officers of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case of Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Department seemed cautious at the time of accepting political processing after several important reviews for its public integrity section, including the decision of the last year to abandon the processing against the former Senator Ted Stevens, in the middle of charges for the wrong conduct of procedure.
Federal taxes "seem to be clearly a cobards", said Melanie Sloan, the Executive Director of Civil Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group who brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high rango government officers now can assume that laws are not applicable to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer of Ensign, said in an interview that received a telephone call from a complainant from the Department of Justice on Monday and another call more on the next day, saying that the department did not want to lift charges against his customer.
The Ensign Defence Team was cooperating with the fiscals in trying to convince them that the Senator, as his office, repeated in a statement on Wednesday, " acted in accordance with the law".
Coggins refused to explain detailedly the legal arguments given to the tax officers.
"I don't feel comfortable to enter in details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they have taken the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Committee of Elections decided to change an investigation in a claim separated by the ethical group, which claims that a payment of 96.000 dollars from the Ensign parents to Hampton violated the Federal Electoral Law.
The electoral committee said he had not enough evidence to demonstrate that money was only a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that has supported the senator for a long time, which has been able to work through lobby thanks to the help that Ensign gave Hampton.
A email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobby, the Ensign office head, John Lopez, communicated with Hampton and told him that he was "making" the Ministry of the Interior on a question in question.
Ensign also attended a breakfast with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to establish a ́ in the name of the airline after having contracted Hampton to make lobby.
When the news of the matter appeared first last year, Ensign requested permission to his electors and rejected its position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for months, Ensign told the journalists who planned to postulate a third mandate in the Senate two weeks ago.
When the Ensign voter, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer subject to a criminal investigation, the senator said that the Ethics Committee would soon follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude its investigation.
"The Senator Ensign wants to continue his hard work in the name of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appointment will point to Twitter
There were a half twelve of them in the rows of the court room.
A minute a minute, they sent reports of the horrible witness via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 news from Twitter about the process of violation and children attached to their beds in a house that was arrested fire.
On Thursday, the broadly followed process of Steven J. Hayes, who was condemned by the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the establishment of the judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have presented writings in the court that deal with the arguments of the appointments that will probably take place in courts for years.
One of the most provocatives that the intense reports on the process, including the broad use of Twitter by the journalists of massive information media, created "a cycle atmosphere", and such a generalized and immediate saturation with exhibiting details made public patients an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force the appointment judges to address the question of whether the new technology reaffirms new rules in the court room.
"If what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the court room is affecting the rights of the individual to have a righteous process," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the Master Defence Lawyer of Mr. Hayes.
The judge of the first instance Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Court of Justice, was laconically requested in a failure last week, saying that the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been brought by the patient.
But it will probably not be the last word on the subject.
The courts have recognized that the covering of celestial cases can generate questions on the impartiality of a process.
In a historical failure of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States revoked the condemnation of a Osteopat of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, by the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, who had "a carnaval atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime was inspired by the television programme and the "Feiler" film.
Some lawyers said that the courts of appointments who examined Mr. Hayes' sentence may be intrigued by the argument that new rules could be necessary to control the form of communication from the court rooms, something inimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason for anxiety on the impact of the new media," in high profile processes, John J. Donohue III, a teacher of the Law School of Stanford, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report in which it was said that it was arbitraryly introduced.
Professor Donohue said that some appointment judges could feel intrigued by the idea that limiting the immediate communication from the court rooms could make judgments more fair.
The question of Twitter is only one of many of the subjects delineed by the Haies lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defence lawyers, for example, also have been harmed when the Court of Blue refused to test the reactions of potential jury, showing them spectacular graphs of the crime scene during the election of the jury.
Some jurymen said they were terrified by the victims' graphs, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their daughters, Hayley, of 17 and Michaela 11.
Defence lawyers say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and will insist that the judge was wrongly removed from a jury that had criticized the fiscals and that he had wrongly pressed for a sentence for his strange decision to order the jury to decide for a weekend.
The jury were not cut off.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense covering of the process can affect most of the interest.
They observed in a refusal to the verdict last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates for Governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media continued to cast wood in the fire of the emotion on the case.
"The daily aglomeration of the TVs of the media, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, " something has never been seen here in New Haven and perhaps in all the state."
Your attention to Tweeter's covering is controversy.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint on the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports provided more slowly, was a fair vision that would make the court's policy on the control of coverage weak in future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts often felt attached to the arguments on the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technical changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that claim.
In his writing, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 1966, which revoked Dr. Sheppard's sentence due to the covering of the process, and made clear that the new media would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 20th century."
Can the civilian have a power to join the divisions?
After a famous campaign for invection and negativity, this week has been discovered a little civilian in Washington.
Is it a preagage of a real bipartid cooperation in the future or an illusional moment before a quick flight to the party fight in the capital?
The Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not make any progress in the major issues that should be discussed during the outcome session.
But because they all say, it was at least a short discussion on the differences of the two parties, as well as a recognition of their responsibility to govern, rather than another empty episode to win partisting points.
The public on Wednesday of the Chairman's Deficit Committee was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that the interaction east for a period of months has generated a mutual respect that exceeds the ideological breakdown that still separates the members.
That is only enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Now both parties are in a test period, it is mutual to identify signs of cooperativeness and commitment, while they are trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and the patientity of voters for a renewed party war.
The reason for which Tuesday and the later evaluations of the participants were made with a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophy differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are very deeply arrayed as to suggest any quick climate change in the last two years.
About taxes, expenditures, health assistance or social assistance, both parties are located in the opposite.
In any way, the election of November has sustained the humor in Washington, at least a short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed about how to say things," said Pete Wehner, a officer of Bush's administration now in the Centre of Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after elections.
Elections discover partial patents, then extinguishing.
That's good."
In some issues, particularly in the agenda of the outcome session, the Republicans and Democrats have no other option to find a solution.
Bush tax reductions are winning at the end of the year, and no one is for this.
Both parts want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is a commitment to enlarge unemployment subsidies, probably because the Republicans cannot believe that they are in favour of the reductions of taxes for the rich, refusing unemployment subsidies for unemployment workers.
After Tuesday in the White House, there is more optimism for a possible treatment of these issues during the outcome session, together with the ratification of the new nuclear disarmament pact START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, from the Brookings Institute, warns that the successful cooperation in the issues of the outcome session will not necessarily lead to a continuous bipartidism when the new 112th Congress is meeting in January.
On the contrary, he appealed that is very inevitable and even inevitable, which begins a period of disagreement.
"When the things that should be done are carried out, psychology will shortly return the situation to a confrontation," he acknowledged.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is largely implied) on the fact that citizens can lead to a real cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a test for 2012's main growth," he advised.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new majority of the Republican in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, which have contributed decisively to its creation.
In addition to the consciousness that the Republican leaders have on the dangers of overgreading their position, they know that they should try to fulfil their promises of covering the costs of the state and canceling the new health law.
These partidary lines are already clearly observed in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Committee, including reform of the tax code and increase in certain taxes and jubilation age, and expenditure coverage.
The co-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the most difficult work in Washington and, if they have their own assessment, have introduced the issue of deficit in the order of the public day in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the Committee of 18 members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been fighting to reach that number.
The greatest resistance is among the officers chosen on the panel, suggesting that, at least at the moment, there are few bases or desires for the commitment.
Galston predicts two phases in the fights between the Republicans of the White House and the Congress.
The first year will take place in the form of partial shocks when the Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a more bilateral cooperation period.
What would the change cause?
The public opinion.
There are significant evidence that, despite the partism of the recent election, most Americans still want to see both parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead point, as happened in 1995, both parties will take care of the reaction of people.
Whoever thinks you're losing will probably change the course and seek compromise.
However, this may be a optimistic vision.
Partidism and polarisation are currently greater than the middle of the 1990s, and it seems that there is a greater ideological place between Obama and the Republicans of the Congress than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at their time.
At the same time, both parties' activists see 2010 as the prelude of a more transient election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism that is shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort from both sides to find common points in the issues that still divide them.
A filtered document returned to Moscow as the Paradise of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy", and leaves a part of the salaries and protection money that takes directly to Kremlin, it was informed in February the Embajada and ↓ in Russia.
It was informed that both the police and the Federal Security Service managed a huge changing system, which helps to explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They recover money not only from legal business, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each stretch of bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "verticality", takes part as the money is up on the scale.
The note, sent to Washington under the name of Embajador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on his website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censured.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still a master of Moscow, and he was guilty of much corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev revoked him in October, but there has been a little evidence of an eye from then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a major building company, have systematicly refused corruption accusations over the years, and he has won several library requests on such accusations.
In September, when in a Russian TV channel they asked you about a documentary that would suggest that he was corrupt, he said, "It's a crazy, a patrol, a fault."
Inquiries are held, the Russians believe arrogantly that their society is corrupt.
But it is inu_ find the details explained detailedly, since they were in the ambassador's report, and it is uncertain that they are the diplomatics of a foreign country who do so.
"The direct slaves of the Government of Moscow with criminality have led some to call it "disfunctional" and to say that the government works more as a claptocracy than a government," the note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a crisha (a term of criminal world and mafia that literally means "tech" or protection) that translates the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the office of the fiscal, and all sectors of the government of Moscou.
"The analystes identify a three-level level in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is on the highest."
"The SFS, MVD and Milicia are on the second level."
"Endly, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill an empty in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report is that the SFS recovers the money of the largest companies and that the police refers to small trades.
One source, said the report, "explained that Moscow's trade owners understand that it is best to achieve the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal pandillas is no longer a priority."
The note notes that, while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those paying are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay rapidly find their business closed by a pretext or other.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but he has admitted that it has been a little progress.
The note of the ambassador reports about men taking bottles, probably full of money in reality, within the same Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev must trust the bureaucrates," George Satarov, director of the Indem Expert Group in Moscow, announced at a recent interview.
"But he is part of this bureaucracy."
"He doesn't belong to a political class, because there is no more political class in Russia."
Without political, without opposition, without a separate of powers, the corruption is inevitable.
At the national scale, Indem estimates that the corruption costs Russia more than 300 billion dollars per year.
In a recent investigation on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental transparency International organization, the country was classified in post 154 (the countries are classified at least to the most corrupt).
The discovery of the note of Ebajada and, which has not occurred until the night of Moscow, will certainly cause disappointment within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov can be guilty of Moscow's weaknesses, it might be a chance that Kremlin's argument that is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents could be lying and re-reactivated by a revelation that the diplomatics and ́s name was Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policies in this country," he acknowledged.
"But to be honest with you, we don't suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such a way of immorality."
The Veterinary of the Red Jemers obligated to keep the past
In a concrete lowly illustrated school, with walls broken and cut off, the director of the Secondary School Anlong Veng reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemeres Ta Mok.
"All of us love Ta Mok here."
"He was a good leader and worried about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "The Carnicero" for its brutality during the Government of the Red Jemmers, the commander remains popular in this remote ex-fortaleness of the Red Jemeres in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infra-shoppings, and where still live thousands of former soldiers of the organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemmers were rejoiced before the government, the loyalty supported for a long time is finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed the victims that would publicly guard people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the Government distributed here a secondary school text book that for the first time shows the history of the Red Jemmers to the children of his former soldiers.
And in July, a mixed court of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Jemmers, sentenced the former leader of the known Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years of prison.
With each of these attitudes, anxiety has grown between the Veterans of the Red Jemers of Anlong Veng, complicating the efforts to reconciliate and their attempts to reintegrate into the Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear between the former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, a independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Years was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within the families."
The Government of the Red Jemmers of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, was executed or died from hunger, disease or work, about 1.7 million people.
When in 1979 the vietnamites invaded and dropped the government led by Pol Pot, the rest of the regime and their military soldiers fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that took place until the last movement that was thrown in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the war of guerrillas from their bases on the mountains and the Western Cambodia forests, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990s, after a United Nations Patrocinated Peace Agreement led to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, large groups of the Red Jemery fighting groups began to devastat against the Government, covering the rents of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died for natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Mounts Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for the process.
Without the support of their benefits, the oldest fighters of the Red Years fell into the absolute misery that is common in the rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few of the Red Jemmers' elite officers have kept their local administrative posts in exchange of their weapons, racial soldiers are still poor and unqualified farmers.
"These people have received a few benefits after the ren," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopic agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept to make business."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Red Jemers when he was a teenager in 1974, was in the forest near Anlong Veng before he was dedicated to life as poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemmers was good," he admonished.
"Ta Mok gave him all to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to self-substitute."
The current court of the Red Jemmers has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of the next year, the court is expected to begin processing Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Jemery.
The mandate of the court is to process the main leaders and those who are greater responsibility for the criminals, but he did not say if it would be more than those four cases.
This does not serve much to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent speculation of the media has been focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who was a leader of the Province of Banteay Meanchey during the Government of the Red Jemmers at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers of the Cambodia Documentation Centre that he had monitored the construction of Trapeang Thma prison, a project in which it was thought that thousands of forced workers have died.
A recent bochorn afternoon, Im Chaem worked again in the fields at his home on wood pilots on a terrain road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun dropped long shadows on the dry feed, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeres.
She acknowledged that if the court would not present her.
"Camboya is in peace and stability," he advised.
"If there are more processing, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was devastated from the Red Jemmers in 1978, has also warned repeatedly that there will be instability if the court follows more suspicious, even though experts and historians question it.
"Camboya must catch a bullet and bury the past," he advised.
But to keep the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to progress, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation, if Khmer, is back to join the round pieces," he appealed.
"It's our obligation to gather these pieces of roads so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first text book approved by the Government on the Red Jemers, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the secondary school text book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemeres.
Like in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about the Red Jemers, despite the town's link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, a 19-year-old student at the Secondary School of Anlong Veng, said that the new text book helped students to understand an important part of their history.
But their parents reactivated with scepticism when he brought the book home to study.
"My family has many parts of the text book and the court," he advised.
"They have suspects because they are not sure of the number of people that will be processed by the court."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complete and difficult, Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he appealed.
In any way, here the Red Jemers keep a powerful pleasure.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a way with too bad grass and ≥berry plastic bottles leads to a rectangle of the black holiday ≥ oxidated thickness of hojalate.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of neumatians after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell seller at the border of the road, said he didn't know much about the man that was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place will go there to resort to him," he admonished.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day decided to walk to the place of the last rest of Pol Pot, where he would leave a hand of mature planets with the hope of having a good happiness.
Belarus accepts rejecting its qualificated uranio reservation for weapons
In a surprising victory for the campaign of President Obama to protect the nuclear material worldwide, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that will reject its highly enriched uran reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The treaty was revealed in a joint statement published after the Minister for Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton had meet with the Belarusian Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergei Martynov at the margin of a security summary.
For years, the government and has tried to convince Belarus that he had rejected his highly rich uranium and seemed to have reached a point without return to the past firstborn.
But the officers and officers told Washington Post that a couple of operations classified with Belarus during the last two months, to recover 84.82 kg of qualified uranio for weapons from an installation of whiterussian research.
This prepared the ground for the midnight agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, is a officer, who spoke from anonymous due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations presided by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And, of course, it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summary in 2012.
"I really felt fascinated about the fact that they wanted a place at the Nuclear Security summit of 2012."
"This shows that this process is working," Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Society, said, "a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all the vulnerable nuclear material worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the Government has helped six countries to disable all its highly rich uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen of countries did it under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarus Chairman, Alexander Lukashenko, had declared that the nation would never reject its uranian.
"We have kept the highly enriched uranium (cents of kilograms of what is basically qualified uranio for weapons) and low-richness uranium," Lukashenko warned at that time.
"This is our primary material... we're not going to make sucking bombs, and we won't sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research, it's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
The officers said that the first task to remove the uranio of Belarus in October was particularly complicated, since the material had been easily irradiated.
The officers said that he was loaded in a special train that traveled over 2,000 km to a Russian installation for storage and elimination.
The officers are held, the second operation ends in Monday and was made in a plane.
The Government and _BAR_ spent 13 million dollars for tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus the installation of low-riching investigations, which is not irrelevant for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a officer of the Department of Energy who works in the Global Aminosure Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and very carefully orchestrated to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranio qualified for arms, as well as hundreds of highly rich uranio kilograms.
Belarus will try to remove its reservation until 2012, if the joint declaration is.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tensed for years, especially because of the awake repression of Lukashenko on human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggested a potential distance.
It was stated that "as the progress was welcomed in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that more respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue to improve bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not fix flights
The Spanish Government did not repair flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda with direction to Guantánamo by Spanish territory, but the US ambassador was expressed in a telegram in Madrid.
This reflects the filtered documents (capables) by Wikileaks at the journal El País, where it is added that the first president of the Government, Maria Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked the Spanish Executive to be informed to "be demonstrated that they were exercising a proper supervision of foreign aircrafts through Spain".
In June 2006, after a report from the Council of Europe in which he accused compliance in practices contrary to human rights to a twelve countries, including Spain, there was a range between the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de Vega.
The President recognized that the Council's report " had taken the Zapatero Government out of game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain has no repairs to the intelligence flights to the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "needed pills", reports Aguir in a cable.
In addition, Miguel Angel Moratinos, then holder of Foreigners, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "will give this subject the lower profile, even though the Government was in the hands of judges, had a limited influence capacity."
On its part, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González transmitted the Ebajada that would not block the initiative of the judge to request declasification of the documents of the National Centre of Intelligence (CNI) and the Defence Minister for Flights.
"These reports contain no in-actor or sensitive information," explained the Embajada after talking to the fiscal.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern for the "visual coordination between the Spanish judge and the German fiscal", more than for the disclasified information of the CNI or the Defence Minister.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle the case discretely between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, in a breakfast between the US Ambassador and the Minister of Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he recommended that "although the Spanish judges are rabbiously zealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had given instructions to his co-operators "to avoid comments of retorical inflammate, in an attempt to decrease the temperature".
The ambassador also expresses its concern for the action of the PP in this matter.
"With its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not doubt to capitalize any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if these revelations have negative effects to the Government of the United States."

Defence and fiscal requested a psychiatric test.
Populars would win 4 songs at the Congress and the PSC 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and Members experienced in recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has the view of the generals, therefore, the perspectives are more than positive, since the number of votes that this training receives in these committees often doubled to those receiving in the catalysts.
Thus, the popular Catalanes received 610.473 votes in 2008, while in 2006's autonomies, the number was 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
To maintain this trend up, which has been fed by a transmission of votes from the PSC and the validation of the PP electorated, analystes of this training have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 Members at the Congress, while the CIA would also win four (now has 10) and the CSC would have nothing less than 9 Members (he has 25).
These estimates would find that the Catalan place is essential for PP and PSOE.
The analysis of the populars, ERC had a member - now he has three - while the ICV remained with a member or would win one.
However, to maintain the electoral calendar, the most immediate date will be held in May 2011 with municipal committees, where the people may also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemonia in the four provincie capitals and in their reference to the Deputation of Barcelona, one of the administrative administrations that the largest budget operates - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
At the same time, both nationalists and popularists coincide with the possibility that the PSC loses Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona's meetings, where the socialists would not receive most of their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
According to the Republican debat, this training would not be discovered to lose its representation in the Barcelonian Council - it needed 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced to be able to protagonize the wind in the Tarraconese capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist host, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been held only to 500 votes of the PSC, whose boss, Angel Ros, maintains very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, has been found in several times.
Populars have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Casteldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalogue and encourages to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaida
Besides the seven arrested in Barcelona, there were three
The seven Pakistanians and Nigerian detained by Police Information Commissioner General in Barcelona formed a Yihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigres for the Liberation of the Earth of Tamil" and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), author of Bombay's final attacks that caused death in 2008.
The Ministry of Industry has given great importance to these investigations, until the point to ensure that the "Kampai operation" has been "depressed" the Al Qaida international employment equipment and, therefore, "her operational capacity".
Researchers calculate that the cell, in the two years that has been active in Catalogue, has been able to send thousands of passengers to Thailand, where they were distributed and then distributed to the groups integrating the criminal galaxie in Qaida so that its "conflicters" could cross the European borders and other western countries with total impunity.
The exciting cell is not the only one that the yihadist network was operating in Europe, since they have participated in researchs, as well as the Tailandian services, other European police units, so it is not dismissed that in the EU territory they will be carried out in the next days similar to the developed on Wednesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanians Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) developed another with the capture of the Pakistanians Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Tailandian Sirılaya Kijbum.
These were those who led the cell sitting in Spain from Bangkok and other European countries.
The catalan network - part of it was struck in 2009 - was mainly stealing tourists who meet the requirements marked by the "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents should be named for 25 to 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without printed views.
In the research, it is highlighted that no data has currently been found to be linked to arrested in Catalogue with Bombay's attention, despite that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the recipient groups of the passengers stolen in Spain and then . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
However, it should be remembered that days before this attention was made, from Catalogue were sent to a transfer agency of approximately a thousand dollars who were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards which were then used by the "command" integrants that ended with the lives of 106 people.
Police has been covered by documentation.
The PP requires more to park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity of exposing it personally to Artur But its conditions to support its investment as a president of the Generality, identical to the already planned campaign and that are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the presence of filo-soberanist adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to place in the equator of his mandate.
The Chairman of the popular Catalanes came to Artur Mas with the security that has been given to 18 Members in the elections of the last Sunday, numbering more than enough to wish, since the CIA candidate needs at least one of the trainings that will exercise the opposition to be abstained in the vote of investment.
A possible understanding of the PP of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And as regards the President of the PP, to support an investment "will have to park all sovereignist and independent talks", as well as the economic concert - similar to the Vasco country - that the convergence leader even intends to submit to reference.
Both leaders have a common position to enhance the political equipment of a very efficient autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax of subsequences and donations.
The details of the negotiation on Mas's investment will be taken into account by the PPC, Jordani Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already been meeting with Joaquim Natal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidarity Catalana).
The geneatric that deaths were not due to "the lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot don't dismiss to kill his carrier more than 11 elderly
The responsibility of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a pressure road yesterday to highlight the damage caused by the institution the crime conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the guardian who, while he was there, killed at least 11 elderly who had his charge.
The director of residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the letter of the center, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of the Charity would be able to execute the accusation against the responsible" of the deaths but "the legality and responsibility force us to assume the processal situation of civil responsibility".
And it is that, besides the social disappointment that can suffer because they have not at times detected the criminal activities of the celitor, the great threat to the Charity is now a form of substantive compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' families are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has admitted that the first crime is going back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out on the car that ordered the exhaustation of eight body - ancient patients in the geriatric - which suspected that in many cases no doctor was personally exploiting the dead but that, as the age and pathology of the patients, the phone trammite was discovered.
The Charity, to its director, rejected this extreme yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures could no longer have been the cause of what happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case there is no only indication that there has been an imprudent action by any other person who is not the own imputed."
The already baptized as "Angel de la Death" admitted before 11 murderers and detailed that the first crime committed it on August 29, 2009 for, one month and a half later, killing a second grandfather.
In this case, the death of pinch caused him a overdose of insulin, contrary to the first crime that helped him from a mixing of seating patrons.
The Director of the Carta points out that it is complicated to control that the staff in the centre has access to medicines.
Insulin pinchases and seats cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimines that the carrier, in his hand, used to devote the suffering of the insides, to kill them.
But they will be the analysis that are being made in the field which must declare if Vila doesn't lie and seeked for her first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, if he had abrased them inside of them as he has already admitted what he had done with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In the Charity they don't believe the manifestations of the celator, nor even if it is to the number of confessed murderers, who do not disregard that it is greater, and justifie their own in the various versions that Vila has given in its visits to the judge and in the short sense that it has to change its way of walking after having done successfully eight murderers.
That is why they say that they are made available to justice to explain the achievement of this event.
The ECB threats
Investors repeated yesterday to Trichet's threat that warned "the markets should not subestimate our reaction capacity."
Periferic differences have been closed with force and the actions of Europeans have increased more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not also subestimate the ability of the ECB to fail, and the euro just pointed out what is an anxious sign.
What has been done yesterday is the own of an illicit market that is like the deployment is recovered but motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will late in fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to recover liquidity measures, and it will have to return tomorrow for four times in two years and those remaining.
The Bundesbank needed to complete the public debt purchase plan for ineffectively and remove all extraordinary liquidity measures at the time and leave only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures "almost until March" will be prolonged and keep the quarterly substance with unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure the liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they continue with their bond purchasing programme and even give them the sign of intensifying it.
If they do not comply with the expectations generated, they will return the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be obliged to recover liquidity measures, God will help us!
Like in May, where they hadn't considered the purchase of goods and colapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be reliable and sustainable.
In May, the baseball announced Monday and Wednesday said he had already bought a lot, providing a new market diplom.
Last year, the submission of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, rather than 750 million to 4.81% of the previous submarine.
Still, the rates in Portugal fell 30 basic points throughout the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market feeling after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the numbers of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The estimated numbers are about 10,000 million to short term and 15,000 potential and have until February to get private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the numbers are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday next, the Government will have to achieve the parliamentary approval of its new budget and has not yet enough support, so Ireland is still a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the ton of its speech to relax the face pressure to the next State and Government Chefs meeting on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed that shows that we are a union and that we all are playing the same party.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present the plan of measures that will be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial communities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to reactivate employment sounds in the ears of investors such as the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Bolsa has risen to 4.5%, the double than the rest of European Bolsas.
In contrast to February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been quick and constant and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key key to a good to three years that will be benefited by the effect of Trichet, so we hope that it will be solved with strong demand and helps to discern doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Aid Plan would be a self-inflation.
We would give a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available in March than in March, carrying careful types and closing access to the markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be the woman of Caesar, "besides being it, it seems it."
Animo, we can.
The President of Eulen will complain the Vega Sicilia meeting requested by his children
The time is not tomorrow in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will complain, by considering it "nulla of full right", the Jurisprudence of the next day 16, requested by five of its seven children and in which they will try to make their majority valid and to make it with the authorities of management of the signature holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons, Jesus David and Mary Joseph, are accommodating the legal battery for the new Judicial Chapter in their litigation for the control of the group.
The main holder of business services to the company seems not disposed to cease in its litigation to be present in the Governing Bodies of El Enebro.
From its administrative advice, five of its seven children who were nominated administrators at the Officer Assembly of 18 January this year and whose impugnation is noted in the Mercantil Register.
The Court of Justice of El Enebro for the next day 16, convocated by the judge of Mercantil Number 2 of Madrid, has opened the box of the ravens in the sene of the Alvarez family again.
The resource to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the assembly.
The last movement of John Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is qualified by David Álvarez as a "expected resource for the applicants of their five children to, by processing arguments, clearly fraud of the law and abuse of law, try to validate and heal the assembly radically nole of January 18th", is guarded by their official portfolio.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly is held, to its complaint, considering that it is "null of full right".
The same protagonists, who keep a silent discrete, have already been unrealistic that the judge would call a meeting in June.
In the Enebro, the patrimonial society and the holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other actives, the seven sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims that the fruits of over 51% of the capital are the family protocols.
This issue is the fundamental issue that the judge should decide once the view of the request for impugnation is held, for which there is not yet a date set out.
Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software designs improvements in real time cars.
Since Red Bull broke in the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his story in this universal selection of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At the first time, no one took into consideration the options of a recently arrived scattery and, despite the upcoming traictory of the last seasons, last November, at the end of the campaign, everyone was apostated by the Ferrari Triunph of Fernando Alonso.
Without disturbing the ability as a pilot of the final campeon, the German Sebastian Vettel, neither of the capacity of the Renault engine that propulses its car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "heim weapons" that the multinational Siemens has put into Red Bull's hands to make it a winner team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that Germany placed on the market in 2007 for very remote purposes from high car competition.
Named PLM, this powerful informatic instrument has been used to design manufacturing chains of manufacturers throughout the world, energy plants, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, simulate the product or process faithfully before building it in real manner, avoiding such failures and avoidable expenditure.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's graphical cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this informatic instrument in its formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and perform "in few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements that are detected during the careers and tests.
Russwurm explains that the scouts in 1992 had a average of 10 technicians in their team that were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in the vehicles during each season.
In the Red Bull team, 180 high-quality professionals work today that, equipped with powerful informal equipment, analyze and project all sorts of changes in the teams.
The Siemens Director explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull's elements with engine-option, which is of Renault's entire responsibility.
Materials, fuel, dynamic and safety elements are changed.
Changes can be brought from the simulator's reality to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production systems through laser and high-technology autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this crash of technology perfection is the number of $40 million that each team of Formula 1 can cost as maximum at each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has mounted the high-technology factory to design and manufacture its raisins in a location of about 50 km from London.
It is two buildings where visits are limited, especially for journalists.
Everything happens there is considered "height secret".
The model for this committee is 580 people, including their two pilots, the Vettel campaign and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is, of course, the recent campaign Sebastian Vetell.
Among the large technical resources that the brand of energy drinks has placed to the service of their participation in circuits are hidden by other protagonists whose competition is inestimable and their nul notoriality.
The manufacturer's technology leader Steve Nevey, who was five years ago, could have made that I+D's advances in road cars offered 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed and the technologies are reduced by 85% of the success, while the pilots give up 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer because "they are unnecessary gladiators".
HP will install 20 own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) yesterday in Barcelona his first tent in collaboration are his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20 trading network between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational will install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will compatibilize this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-mark centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and the English Court.
The president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, put as example the remodelated tent where in the Grand Via Barcelonesa, the property of Pont Reyes, with whom he has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first in opening were Bucarest (Rumania) and Serbia (Serbia) last week, which was the third of Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to discover the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also ensured that the philosophy to install the tents will always be the same, supported in a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is responsible for the mobiliary design of tents (with products that can be interactively played) which will have an identical image in Europe.
Furthermore, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero refused to be a franchise system and stressed that the trade network intends "better the customer and pymes service in purchasing, attention, potential and even packing".
The Barcelona tent includes a space with a global pilot programme that is responsible for resolving the possible problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
A online service with a technical centre located in Maastricht, Netherlands.
"So, in 10 minutes, we can solve problems that sometimes can be late until two days."
"This system is especially designed for pymes and users, since large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," he noted yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell placed for 'screwing' a million clients to their rivals in three years
More optimistic than other guidelines, the delegated adviser of Bank Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the employment, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and vatican at the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, there is a deplomation of interest margins, which will be compensated in part by the extent of commitments and the price of the credit.
Sabadell expects to catch a million particular customers in three years, his demanding assignment.
Sabadell has found a way to explode the next three years and so power to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
It will run in 2011 a new director plan which will have a three-year viability.
The objective, in addition to surviving unnecessaryly to recover the public aid of the FROB, is to win a market share with catching a million new customers -700,000 if those who can go out of it - their great demanded assignment, since it has yet been more mixed to pymes and companies than to the minorist client.
This year has taken 250,000 individual customers and 500,000 companies.
Its market share is particularly 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity, or what is the same, with a decrease of costs as a target, and the challenges of which will be exposed when the results of the exercise are present.
A few are attracted in these times to set up objectives and to make them public because the financial crisis has distorted all the world's plans.
Sabadell, actually, will closure its plan director Optima this year, set four years ago, although it was initially for three, but the situation of the markets has made it a further exercise.
The customers who leave the boxes to escape will be their main goal.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be a "difficulty and transcendental" year.
The executive actually believes that the outcome of the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Moreover, in two or three years, it will be "very difficult to create employment", something fundamental for the super-asset of business, it insisted.
And even though he believes that the war of the passive - which penalties the margins - is reduced, the price of the risk premies which are paying and boxes for their liquidity are already transferring to the price of the credit to compensate the fall of margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is ≥l, and it will be a factor of pressure on credit."
"We haven't closed the grip, but the differences are higher," Guardiola recognized.
Banesto has already given orders on Thursday to their network to limit the long-term loan and to highlight the price of the differences - see fifthdays of 22 and 27 November.
He also recognized that the tendence of the stage now "is to take up commissions", but "There is a framework".
The Sabadell Director plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not dismiss corporate operations.
Not in vain, make sure in Spain "they will require greater sizes."
"The year that comes will move everything," she assured.
It claims that capital needs are "increasingly" and does not dismiss any Spanish financial between red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can supplie the market in catching funds for new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive to the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important to what some bankers have vaticinated as a new liquidity crisis.
It indicates that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, a short-term financing can be obtained, which affects the crisis.
The CECA rejects a second oil of fusions in the boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday an oil of box fusions and insisted again on the speed with which the recycling of the sector is being implemented.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish boxes was started, several of them were assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Cashs of Ahorros (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday that this new oil of operations would take place.
"I think the largest part of the fuses has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol to the Civil Bank Group cannot be said that it is a second round, which is adjustment."
"The majority is completely done; we may be going to 13 or 14 instead of 17 but all the large processes have already been made and have been tapped by the Bank of Spain, which has also cooperated very much in it," said the Director.
In statements during a breakfast of the Aragons and Executive Association (ADEA), Olavarrieta has expressed that the concentration process is coming "to the fastest possible, and we must be very satisfied with how it will take place in the periods that were not now marked in business plans with the Bank of Spain," empathi.
"The passport of 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that does not have parangons in the history, reducing the number of ≥ 62% to be much bigger to meet Basilea," he highlighted.
Olavarrieta recognized that " there is a series of very little happy opinions on the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and meaning," because "the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the term before the end of the year".
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most strict financial system of all Europe and "prove" in the world, and assigned to those who put it on a "known failure".
The Director pointed out that, within the current economic cooking, "we can be very quiet" with the situation of the financial and insurance boxes, a system that has initiated a "important" concentration process and that "goes to the best possible speed".
He also recalled that Spain was very closely stopped from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to keep it in the euro, but has established the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions on the market have caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to pyes, regulations of private agencies of the 426 euros for aid to stops without performance, up to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat ports and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, President Elena Salgado, with the support of president Felipe González, has been summed to the criticisms of the Angela Merkel cancer for its responsibility to disappoint the current crisis.
How should you interpret these moves?
The position of Merkel is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turn of turkey in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And Germany has a radically new vision of what should be his future, which is a shame of maintaining the ancient traditions of many of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany begins to speculate about the three possible outcomes to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Netherlands, among other countries, while south would leave the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the frame, although now the science seems to be fiction, with a very favourable rate of opinion, nearly 50% of the population.
Third, a replacement of the euro, online with the major macroeconomic control sisters' proposals, budgetary rigor, transferred countries, possible suspension of payments from some of them and private costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and is defined for a long time, so no excuse is now.
First, in 2009, when both FMI and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government took out of the manga a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed that it should be done (facilities and stability plans in public funds) and what they were practicing their European partners, including France.
The second in front of it gave the Central European country when Merkel penitently extended the decision of salvation of Greece.
It was already subject to critical ferozis, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and published were very contrary to the redemption of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again appears with a clear position, by reforming the Treaty of the Union, in order to enable a country's salvation and, at the same time, to force private performances to run part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as an anti-European, since it has predicted the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal has been adopted, although so awaited, and in the next months, we should assist the process of reform of the Union to enable those measures since 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that doesn't think of crossing.
And it is saying to all of us that, although now there are measures that may not be much agreed, from that date the former function of the euro will be completed.
In 2013, the birth of a new monetary area, where the criminal countries will be severely sanctified, may be required to declare in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run with the cost.
Germany points out that we should follow a severe growth path with high rate of dealing and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and outer sales and positive external sales.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge hairs in pay balance, such as the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, they will simply not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd hurt not understanding it.
It is not only to recover the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we need is much worse.
And the worst we could do in these circumstances is to mislead ourselves.
I hope the current turbulences leave to a more quiet.
And that we should use the window of opportunity that they gave us until the breakfast of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also understood this and his double evidence (the reforms promised after the last Sabbath with the large companies and the announcement of yesterday new measures) suggested that, despite the criticisms in Merkel, the tesis that it must be ordered at home has been opened.
But the red line Germany has brought it is, and it doesn't seem to be going to move it.
And, among the possibilities they are discussed, the abandonment of a too stumbled monetary area from less serious countries cannot be excluded.
So Germany can always tell us that he had already warned us.
Deport and fraud of law
Treatments like Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax show engineering but not willing to escape a sanction.
The exposure presumed by two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party disputed on 23 November against the Ajax in the Campeons Liga has caused to write thinth rivers about whether such behavior is anti-sportive and whether both players should be sanctionsed by the EUFA.
As well known, lacking a few minutes to finish the game (which your team had already clearly won), both players lost decisively time at the time to take missing paths to cause the arbitr to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid will end as leader of his group, both players will fulfil the regulatory sanction of the next part of the liquor against the Auxer, and they will be able to pass cards to the next phase.
Finally, the EUFA disciplinary committee has sanctionsed with two parties to the team trainer, José Mourinho, and with various economic quantities for the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but more frequently in the world of football.
It is so extended that it is part of the eths, of the non-written, but followed rules, of this deport.
Part of the debate in the reported case is to be protagonized by a team of the Real Madrid (which in his himno presumes of nobleness and honor, and sometimes has multiplied its players by analogue acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, in view of Mourinho, who adds a more to his historic and provocant technology history.
In any case, the debate turns back if such a non-expressed behaviour is contrary to the principles of the sports, namely, if such action commits fraud of law; therefore, they are acts respectful with the sport regulation, but they seem to dismiss their sense.
The question is being examined by the type of damage that causes sports spirit.
One of the goods that understand the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, the aspect that with these actions was not in danger, namely, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods to which the game pleases is to avoid that the team of criminal players uses injustly the opposite team, which also did not happen.
However, the paradoxic of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that it has not been appealed to what we usually characterize as a trap or fraud of law, because their violation of the rules was not hidden to try to avoid the sanction, but exactly his action tried to be the most evident to receive the punishment of the arbitr.
They waited and accepted the sanction pleasantly.
Another question is what kind of advantage the criminals are obtained in the intentional deficiencies.
Here it seems to be necessary to find that it is not placed in disgusting situation in the rival or benefit in the same party, since the result of the action is obviously to leave the own team with less players.
And it isn't also a useful strategy for the next game, because the club can't count with these players.
The benefit is obviously that players will start the next phase of the Campeons Liga without cards that can threaten their participation in a future party.
But this is a long-term benefit, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team can be removed to the first changes, and with this action, players comply with a sanction party and passe to the second card cycle, where the suspension by accumulation of cards is produced with less than in the first cycle.
So, walking around, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
Finally, these actions are not against the sports spirit, which is part of making strategic decisions that favor the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
Of course, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (that would be a clear case of law fraud), but they chose better to submit to it.
They took a strategic decision without trial or fleeing from it.
Although the border between engineering and law fraud is difused, I think it was a clear case of engineering.
The polemics, I think, arise by two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way the transmission of the guide to provoke them.
The damage caused by sports principles by these actions is not both ethical and esthical.
Offensive of offers to catch groups in NCB
The dictature of the calendar focuses this year on a balance of reservations for the days 16 and 17.
They proliferate the self-sustained celebrations of employees, which want to cost between EUR 20 and EUR 30.
Like the turron and the lottery, with the arrival of December, they also return the groups before Christmas, who continue to exercise oxygen ballon for the restoration and the oxy of Barcelona, but who because of the crisis have been deployed in an adjusted price offence to capture the larger customer: almost everyone wants to expenditure between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or foods, the enterprises and associations of the interviewed sector.
To complete the compliance of the accountability, the calendar of this year (at the fall of the Nochevieja in Fridays) has concentrated requests on the week 13 December, with the result of the date of the date of a date of a spring of licitations for point days (16 and 17) and only movement for the previous week.
As it has already occurred since 2008, when they eat the stage of flakes, many companies have removed the collective stages of budgetary question.
To avoid the tradition, many workers keep it paying for their own bottle.
Whatever coy, one and another require battle prices, confirms the president of the Barcelona Restauration Greme, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the patronal, today, is not attracted to vaticinate how the festivals of this month will be.
"The people think so much before they book."
"It wants to go out but it has the enhanced warnings on the price theme," he points out.
The business will be well "to those who give quality to good price and good service", adds, and recalls that customers are tending to decrease a scale with the crisis, so the fraction in turn to the EUR 25 has become greater in the request.
In a survey in various central facilities, the colapse of requests for the night of 17th is found.
The Soteras Group indicates that there is an authentic buom of applications for that Friday, with the claim to expendire less than 30 euros, which have been answered by adapting their menus to the coya, with full forms of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 places in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, the Fund and other), the calendar's speciality has been more anticipated, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done what is impossible to keep the same prices of the last year, with menus for all pleasures from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
In AN Group, which is the Mussol, Attic, Quu, and up to a total of 23 locals, optimists are maintained after detecting an increase of facturation from the second half and good, even though concentrated, business perspectives for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who preserve the festivals.
The six group menus have added a ship, with 30 euros or more as a star budget, and the perception that there is a prediction to expenditure for 10% more than the last year in exchange of more details, such as cava.
There are also green fractures in some companies who are again invited to their employees and feel that the volume of groups is something greater.
By the patronal Fecasarm (including the Bares, Restaurants and Ocio de Barcelona Association), his president, En Gomà, trusts in starting to see the end of the tunnel and supports that the reservations are "animated", although the customers "disgusting the maximum".
Yes, the illusion for the festivals hasn't come down, pay who pays, indicates.
The Pakistan nuclear programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons to "a faster time than any other country".
Wikileaks filters confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the ambassador and Pakistan and the US State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the great concerns caused by the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
In the margin of the clarifiers and jugoslaw details that offer the content of the conversations and thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives believed in Islamabad, the documents show that cooperation between both countries in the area of atomic security, rather than increasing, "decrease" and that the instabil Asian country produces nuclear weapons "to a faster time than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistan nuclear programme - that weapons are not collected but remain stored by components in order to difficulty destroying them in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for discovery in Washington.
The ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a previous report before visiting the then national security adviser James Jones: "The nearby of some nuclear installations to the territories under the Taliban attack, the sound spread of nuclear materials and the vulnerableness of transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered, not only by the U.S., but also by Russia as a proliferant and reason for maintaining the guard.
"Pakistan had to contract staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; given the fall of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a position with their homologs and Property.
The newest documentation filtered by Julian Assange portal is the most smaller cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistanian nuclear weapons production rythm.
A discharge of the ambassador in May, which qualifys of "frustrant" communication with Pakistan, states: "Transparence is often inexistent; aid offers remain no response or are rejected."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, finds that "through the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster time than any other country in the world".
The ambassador Patterson also requests Washington during a visit to the Head of Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, who leaves "very clear" to the responsibility that "Pakistan Army must end with the silent support for terrorist groups".
At the leader of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new filtering.
Interpol issues a red warning to follow the moves and locate Assange where he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to make sure of the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the moves" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest order.
Moreover, it is not new, but that date of 20 November.
And it does not have to do with the last filtering of more than a quarter of million diplomatic documents in the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Moreover, the lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
It was on 20th day when the international police body with seat in Lyon (France) said the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorisation from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications to identify or locate Assange "with regard to their temporary and extra arrest".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person affected by a red warning, many of the Member States have explained the organization, they consider the called news network freely to go to an arrest -- which must accept the national police body, especially if they have an extra bilateral agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where it is considered to be Assange.
The movement has enraged Assange lawyers, who have published a letter yesterday claiming that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has been disposed to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recognize that Assange requested and received permission to exit from Sweden from the fiscal of its case, compared to the Mith Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin Safety Boss.
"This seems to be a hunter, not a legal persecution," claims the mission.
While the world looks for him - and since his mother was defending the innocentness of his son-- Assange is still in an unknown stand, but not quiet.
Monday has granted an interview from an undetermined place to the director of the Time magazine to Skype, a conversation in which he requested the release of the US State Secretariat, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering diplomatic and responsibility to explain in the United Nations by violating the international treaties signed by the United States, it should be released."
Her opinion was assigned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified for "ridic and absurd" the request for dimission.
"I'm not sure why you should import us the opinion of a guy with a web page," he said to the CNN string.
Obama himself has charged a high responsibility for the anti-terrorist fight, Russell Travers, to prevent new flights of documents.
The intention of President Barack Obama to remain importance to Assange contrasts with opinions that these days publish political and conservative comments.
Peter King, the Congressist who will preside the National Security Committee since January in the low Chamber, has requested the State Department to study the possibility of include Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and its funds and to offer any of any contributions or assistance".
More far away, Tom Flanagan, a adviser of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, who had to return after saying that Assange should be killed.
"Obama should make it goal and use an untrusted plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, baptism minister, Arkansas exhibitor and possible candidate to the presidency.
"Everyone in the Government who filtered information is guilty of delivery and anything that is not the execution would be too nice punishment," said Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with guineas at the Affins in Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote secretly on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the receipt to sort the enemy internal revolt in the ERC lines, without north by the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The Chairman of the Party is aware that its dismissing cover is inadequate for the affins to exlide Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluted as its own mentor and that it can absolutely cause the headbreaks that he had with other extinct flows.
Therefore, the Left leader will win new critics with guineas that allow him to be blinded to municipal elections.
In the beginning, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers could be pronounced on their continuity in secret.
By papers, not by hands lifted.
If the carodists want to carry out a certain penalty vote to the President, they can do it without fear of repression.
In fact, the head of rows wants to avoid the division image as well as the subjection to his person.
In several interviews, he acknowledged that it would not be considered by half one of the votes, but added, without needing percentages, that it would also be a good result of "the bullgar".
The neighbors of Carod require the president something more than to put their duty to the military, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum body between conventions.
But when they do not have enough majority to force divisions, they will agree with the executive a road sheet from here to May.
For this reason, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategy reorientation document that the direction will submit to the vote of the national Council on 18.
Its intention is to evaluate Puigcercós in the change that this promises to advance the convention at August 2011, something that it already gives it in fact.
The leader of the ERC recognized that "polyphony" harms stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once for all, capable of washing the swift gates of doors inside.
In this line, the article that Josep Huguet advised in functions signed in his blog.
Considered as the idealog of Puigcercós, the holder of innovation said that the leader would be refreshed "the change of various objectives".
And he numbered five, of those two.
The first, "recomposing" the executive to represent at least 90% of the military, which includes new faces coming from the affiliated sector to Carod.
The second can be the great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate the assembly once as a functional mechanism.
It therefore proposes a reform of the statutes that allows the conferences to the delegates chosen by suffrage.
The end of the assembly model, an appointment in the Spanish party system, has been a construction of the Puigcercos team, which has already been battled in this regard at the last two congresss.
In fact, the 2008 conclave conviction left the responsibility to revise the assembly at a specific status reform conference.
This appointment continues as the internal sea in the past years did not advise to address the matter.
Now, without critical sectors at appeal, it may be a good time to retreat it and shut it forever.

Keep China's objectives to reduce invereffekt gases
The representative of that country in the COP16 assured that its country has made great efforts to reduce the carbon coal and detailed that it supports its proposal for reduction for 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent of its emissions of inver-effective gases.
China maintains its offer to reduce between 40 and 45 per cent its emission of inver-effective gases to 2020, assured its Wei, representative of that country in the COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made great efforts to reduce the carbon flow and to restore its industry.
In fact, in the last four years, your country has invested $245 million in the efforts to reduce the emission of inverting gases.
However, it clearly made that China would not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
It refers to that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four headings: dialogue; capacity building; institutions and pilot programme support.
In all these rubries, it has been made progress, including the approval of a new Energy Law last year, which collects the objectives of reduction of gas reduction, explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that the Federal authorities in China have worked coordinatedly with the states and locals, to achieve energy effort, energy use and reduction.
Moreover, they are running, or have already concluded several multiannual plans, both financed by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, the Energy Effective Use Programme, which has been implemented in the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations, the Government and the Private initiative.
There is also a provinced project of climate change, another for the change of incoming focus by ahorators, and one more mixing and adaptation, it has detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientist adviser of the Government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than generally thoughts.
For example, exposed, the emission by captain of inver-effect gas in China is six tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
He has also made an effort without energy use, such as increased energy energy in 20 per cent in the last five years, and it has been expected to do so much to 2020.
Added to Legality Expulsion of Spino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former panist leader is in his right to join the National Order Committee to complain what he agrees with.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exemption of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former panist leader is in his right to join the National Order Committee to claim what he agrees to its right.
In a preliminary interview of the protest taken by Gabino Cué Monteagudo as Governor of the State, he said that the expulsion of Espino is, in any case, a decision taken in the local area.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Committee on the Order of Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has his right to access, where appropriate, by complaint to the Committee on the Order of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he stated that it wasn't time to think in 2012 and that it never had been an alien for the presidential candidature.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that national action will be strengthened from the internal election of the next 4 and 5 December, where it will be chosen to its follower.
"This (a alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not for now, was a approach for the local election that was successful and fulfilled the objective," he refers.
The Panist leader needed to support PAN 71 years of dialogue, so "not give us the internal competition; "We enjoy it and strengthen us," he approved.
He said that the advice would certainly be able to choose the best or the best leader to the National Action for the next three years, which would deliver the staff "to whom the advice determines".
"I have that absolute calmness and opening, I would be proud to each of the five deliver the office of the president of the party."
He stated that the reference that the party registered in the last elections of 4 July will be reflected in the following contents, although "no time is still to think in 2012."
"For now it is to join Governor Gabino Cue in this task."
In this context, he highlighted that the three alliance-employed governments in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, that "severe hopes, enemies are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will be at the height of the expectations".
In question of the Criticals of the PRI to President Felipe Calderon for his speech within the four years of his government, Caesar Nava called the prize to reflect on the sex of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that Zedillo and Salinas governments were better than those of Fox and Calderon; that they begin to defend them; that it comes out of the closet," he advised.
He thought that the holder of the Federal Executive could make expressions such as those he did in his speech in the National Auditory, because there is no mood or much less censure in the country.
Promove Obama in Twitter law for undocumentated students
"If you agree that approving the Dream Act Act is the proper thing, call your senators and install them is legislation," said the president stated in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama has joined today the national mobilisation in support of the Dream Act law, to legalize undocumentated students, with a message on its personal account of the social Twitter network.
"If you agree that approving the Dream Act Act is the proper thing, call your senators and install them to approve is legislation," said Obama.
His short message is open to a cibernetical link with a broader document that requests the public to communicate immediately with the senators, since the vote of legislation is imminent.
"with a vote that is expected to happen quickly, now is the time to make your voice listen," he notes.
The message was published after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the recovery of Bush's tax rates and the government's financing is approved.
Such blocking, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
In question of the Republican blocking to the Dream Act and other projects, the presidential portfolio Robert Gibbs believed that once I solve the fiscal issue, a calendar for the rest of the projects could be established.
"I think there's a long time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the fiscal matter before the end of the year..."
"I think we can achieve an agreement at some time in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the democrate majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "debating vote" for the Dream Act law, so the initiative to legalize undocumentated students could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more in the next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or the American Legal would legalize about 800 000 young people who entered the United States before the 16 years, remained in the country in the last five years and entered a higher education institution or military.
However, the parties repeat 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they repeat the concurrence of a pound of Republicans, while partial organizations of the project protagonize an intense chapel to ensure the approval of the law.
Democrates, most of whom the Dream Act supports, have 58 steps.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson de Nebraska, said that he would vote against, and only a Republician has expressed his support to the law, Richard Logar de Indiana.
Thus, the Participants of the Dream Act repeat the summary of several Republicians in the case of other democrats decided to guard the initiative.
Among the most cutted Republicans are the Senators of §, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outset senator George Lemieux, Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Ha, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hu ́inson of Texas, but have declared that they would not support it at another time.
Another Republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position at this time.
Although the Chamber of Representatives has a different version, the analystes agree that the Dream Act is the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
They put their finger on the lake
The second round of the Language pleasures was a passport where the participants made the story gala
"What about the sex in the language I understand, but... is the finger in the tongue? What is it expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of the Like Places of the language, cycle celebrating the Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of his question (in another ferry the round table was dedicated to El sex in the language, explained).
The finger in the laga... "see us in appeals", speeched sweetly the argentin writer to the public, most young people, quoted at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderated round table by Marisol Shultz and where they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that has dedicated Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great account, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "laga" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get answers, even though it's tracks in the same story.
The infectionologist is convinced: "Patience is not my strong, maybe it's my tongue."
Finally, after a distressed approach with the traumatologist who stole his refreshment in the midst of the past, but who claims him that laga is not a scientist term; it is the psychoanalist who reveals the mystery: "the laga is the real open, the sympathic is the cicatriz".
The protagonist suspected alivious and concluded "of the lake only I got to know that it is the real open and that it doesn't exist", but convinced that the pleasure and the traps of the language should go very entered.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The nicaranse Sergio Ramírez also exposed a pleasant story that entitled Elogio of the invention, where the finger in the lake is not appointed but at a moment it is discovered.
With magical reality pincels, accounting of a huge shepherd, which was touching clouds, he brought back to men who had gone far or repaired the lusts that had lost a female, the story that came to speak later to America, the great news to which he did not miss from the beginning his own cronists who told her and quoted her to Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the importances of that accounted by the captains of conquerers.
"Servants who invented us all (the writers) made a bullshit of the finished witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in other words, it would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that he missed until the pot."
However, he highlighted "the crazy and the embusters are those who best imagine" and is where they converge reality and lie, where they are not longer known that it belongs to a band or to another, where it reaches the fixation of its apogeo.
It's actually called "tra" cervein'.
"For her inheritance, we're what's going on."
In its turn, the writer Mayra Montero acknowledged and applauded the variety of interpretations that the invitation of the FIL was made with its table around The finger in the laga.
The Cuban-Portorriquean pointed its point to the great lack of social violence that crossses its country - and the Latin America-product of trafficking and drug sales disputes.
"I believe that goodness, good poetry, good songs will include a tactful commitment which is of course not premeditated," he indicated, after quoting that the reality of the reality is the communication and dimension of the commitment established between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of this last.
On the night, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose intervention also made "of that finger in the lake of the committed writer."
He considered that in a world that lives quickly, also in the intellectual customs and control of consciousness that reduces in dogmatisms, "that there is a small none behind each rejection and behind each negative, there is a small yes."
"To be owners of our thinking and to be owners of the reality, we have to kill: and killing often means putting your finger on the lake and molesting those who are much more comfortable thinking in carcature, white and black, in ideas established and without murder, and also injury the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Roman is going by his first title
Ruben Omar Roman accounted for three breaks at the end, has had high-scale in his career, but has been able to reach the decision-making series at three times.
With the pleasure of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, two different styles are marked by their technicians, which are one another with a contrast marked by the results.
Ruben Omar Roman accounts with three stripes at the end, has had high-scale in his career, but has been able to reach the decision-making series at three times, even though it has gone too white and therefore this opportunity is very special for him.
The argentin has finished consolation with the medal of the subcampeon, a step behind the winners has been left and curiously with the same team has played consequent ends.
The sanctuary strategy reached its first end as a trainer in the Torneo Opening 2002, when he was carrying out the reliefs of Morelia with which he fell globally from 4-2 to Toluca; then, in 2003, he also reached decision-making and also lost it with a total of 3-1 and was exactly before Rayados.
With Santos Laguna, in the Bicentary Torneo 2010, again before the Devils, Ruben suffered a reverse again, since his team ended 2-2 in front of the carriers after 210 minutes of game, but in the penaltis tank he was put in advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for three players finally failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3-storm.
Ruben has already lost two ends with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he doesn't want to run the same lucky, seeking to separate himself from the malicious and able to celebrate a title for the first time, even though it is the most important institution for him.
"I want to get out of the campaign, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an affection to which I deserve, and therefore the title will come for me, but the previous is the most important thing," the timone commented when he questioned about the numbers you have against playing finals.
Very victory has the previous end, of which, assuredly, has been very much, "the only teaching we can have is that until the arbitr will not feast the end, we are prepared in the ray, also the players, because at the previous time, with two penalties for the shore we were already ready to run and I think that this is a teaching, until the game is finished, we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal tyres, something that doesn't worry about you, because he trusts his players: "Every one never seeks to reach the penalty tank, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no other, and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad game played, sometimes by nerves or anxiety to have the title in our hands, but it left us something for this end we expect not to come to that instance."
Roman has in his hands stop being a subcampion technology and testing for the first time the glory that gives the titles.
EU changes rules to obtain visa
People must attend the Service Centres for Visa Requests before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be less and as well as the time of waiting.
From 10 January 2011 it will change the procedure for processing a visa in the United States and consulated Embajada.
With the new procedure, the majority of the applicants must attend the Visa Question Centres (ASC, for their centuries in English) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASCB staff shall take the biometrical information of the applicant, which will be revised by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for aspirants, including:
The total cost of tramiting the visa will be less, no longer needed to make a payment to concert the meeting, another payment to process the request for visa and another more in order to deliver the document.
The aspirant will only carry out a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for cases of views with request (with views for temporary workers) and $390 for commercial and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular official, but will only cover the nearest ASCII where they will present their documents and take their shoes.
Since biometrical information will be taken in the ASCB, the applicants who repeat a second meeting to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this less than in the past.
Similarly, those who request visa in the Consulats in City Juárez, Monterrey and New Laredo will no longer pay the additional service tariff of $26.
For additional information about the new procedure for requesting visa, see http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
He will announce NASA outermost life finding
The Space Agency quoted the press to present a finding tomorrow that will affect the search of living creatures in the space.
The National Aeronautic and Space Aviation (NASA) of the United States will make known tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is alien life.
The finding will be presented in a press road tomorrow at 13:00 a.m. at NASA's seat in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as the responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and the future of life in the Universe.
In citing the press, NASA assured that "a finding that will cause an impact on the outermost life search", which has occurred in specialities of experts in other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures to our couple and in enemy environments that were thoughtable, and they would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent as humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It seems that this is a microbio found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the National Josemit Park, California, where it lives in a environment that was thought too vengeous for any way of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some way, the creation uses arsenic as a way to survive and of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life might exist on other planets, which have no well-being atmosphere.
Astrobiologs, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, will be demonstrated that "yes is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The Space Agency will know the real achievement of findings at the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
At the conference, geobiolog Pamela Conrad, who studied the possibility of life in March, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the greatest moon of Saturno), will participate under the perspective that its chemical is similar to the earth.
Manage PRD, PT, Convergence and 'block' pattern or
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, from the arrival of the 'bipartidism', they claim.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when a Block or Assembly, headed by the Members of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, was declared independently, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of the bipartidism to the Chamber.
Before starting the 60-year-old Legislature session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patron Montalvo, "tronaban" against reform to the Organic Law, as he excluded them.
With this reform, they repeatedly, from the beginning of the "bipartidism", because now two people, of the same number of parties, will be controlled by the Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordination of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board Directive, headed by the Spanish Spansor López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as a president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that these reforms constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He detailed that in the next days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and the PRI to change the scheme, departing from a political will, and if they do not have it, they will be repeated by both parties, and the coalition or coalition will be completed.
"This here has come (the coalition or the coalition), that's what I look, because we are excluded from any decision or whether they have the political difference in considering the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and therefore they are complying with a plural group.
It cannot allow the Congress, after being monopolic, to be "duopolic".
"It is not the spirit of reform to the law that there is a eternal bipatism in the Congress."
In the beginning, this group is starting with five legislators, and they are talking with other companions and companions to be more, the convergence has increased.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that the Congress has now become a "boat" between two, as appeal to PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just one game, now they're distributing it between two."
Pattern Montalvo, requested respect for the personality of the Member, gave him its place in the negotiations tables.
"Why not by cupular agreements, we are left out to 5 that we are probably going to do 9 Members, now the five who see us, separated in different parts, have decided to unify ourselves to seek a place in the negotiation table, that is the subject that in the reform they have made they agreed, we are out and we are not in line with that reform."
$200 billion more for "la provee"
Pay a summary of Mazatlán another check to the questioned property of the material company's ownership of the material.
A more for a little more than 200 000 weights for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was sent by the Ayuntament.
With this, the amount paid in this second semester to the property of the company's materials thetrical is 1 million 200 000 weights.
According to the Municipal transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last 16 November, by the amount of 200,000, 144.56 weights, under the concept of "recovery of accounts for payment".
The Tesoro Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that it would make more money out of the Community for this provision, which was observed by the Supreme Audit of the State for sale to a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that has yet been charged and therefore, how many more checks are missing to be issued for Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased, you're just paying what you should, as the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The latest checks "recommended" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last, of 16 November.
Although the proof has not yet been published in the State Official Journal, as marked by the Law when an undertaking is questioned by the ASEA, in order to avoid other governments using their services, the Treasurer assured that they have not been again using their services.
Previous, following that on July 25, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the Assembly to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9 2010, on the Trinity of the Alcalde Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the municipality more than 10 million weights to 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he covered checks for more than 3 million weights.
Urgency to reach tourist sites
They lament tourist business accidents of the foreign tourist for bad conditions of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a stumbling of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, Mazatlán's tourist sector asked the authorities to take attention to the areas and sites that are in bad state and to project a bad image of the gate.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Dorada Trade Association, reminded that at different times they have claimed to take care of the image of the destination and to return the wrong that the tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and the bankets has affected because tourists are coming to pass and see the disorder and take away the flight to nearby business.
"The politicians don't know what it is to close a company on one day, and they don't have idea of the dineral that is lost, or otherwise, they do not do works in this way as long as and without the debt planning."
Hotelman José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the Ayuntament.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid it again, how to do so by giving preventive maintenance and not only to fall in the corrective," he expressed.
"We are desiring to enjoy a city, because not only because it is a tourist area, the maintenance must be given, but as a people we deserve a site to live and the Assembly must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that also seem to be discouraged and incomplete, he said, such as the Escudo and the Venadito of Mazatlán.
" Today, to come the tourist does not only depend on promotion, it has to have a good product, a city that has beauty on its beaches, in its aventure, permanent maintenance in what the tourists are," he said.
"It has not been given debt attention and this kind of facts show something that is notorial for all, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, subsecret of Tourism Promotion, expressed that the rescue of Mazatlán tourist sites is urgent because they are not correctly used and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be set online together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city daily, ordered, and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers many history and cultural sites that will have to order first, put us online to make them attractive to put them in the inventary we have to promote the destination."
Request IP results to the Conference
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility to be an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges that he has.
A worthy and free work legislation of agreements between parties and the State Executive claims the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that has great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislation, integrated by seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Aliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergence and one of the PVEM, which amounts a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectatives of the new integrants of the State Congress is that they are to take a close and commitment management with the society and with the various sectors that re-responsibility legislation and that they do not repeat the same patterns of partisism or parentalism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the recent 40 members of the State Congress assume the great responsibility to be an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges that he has.
"We expect Members to exercise their rights, free of agreements between parties because it is usual that they make arrangements to protect their own interests and become carnaval comparisons of Governors and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
De that he said that they certified the commitment to establish the needed powers that they take forward to the Governor in turn.
"We want you to do a dignity work, especially committed with society and sectors because the synonyms who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Three Islands, believed that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to empower and summarize forces in seeking the economic growth of the state because the economic situation today is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they emphasize economic growth, which generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow promote the generation of employment."
With regard to tourist activity, he requested the new legislators to give him the weight that was revised within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with less budget and is incongruent as an important economic activity and generates divided and invested and directly competes with the industry's agriculture."
Furthermore, it is remarkable to detonating tourist projects and co-adequate to provide security to the state and update to the Alcohol Law that have not been able to solve in previous legislation.
Searching for a magic king
Muniches, cars and bicycles, among other players, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For your parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to please your illusions, since your home is complied with nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a chivo.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, Joseph Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, Joseph John and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Balthazar give them the players and the clothes they want.
The family lives a humble house of the Salvador Allende Colonia and lives the day because the father does not have a fixed job.
"We sometimes see her hard because my husband doesn't have a chat, but we'll sell mandarina and papa... I'm out with the "plebes" to sell the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, four-year-old, wants a monkey or a bicycle, while his sister Isabel, 3-year-old, would like a Barbie Munich.
By his part, José Alfredo, 10 years old, has aspired from a long time to have a "monster" car and for his brother Jesus, 8 months of age, Cayetana suggests a high clothing for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), "I want this monster," but I told him, " Let's see a son," because he was very dear," he remembered with triumph Cayetana.
For elderly children, who were at school, clothing and hot would be the ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11-year-old, is 12; Isaiah, 10-year-old, is 10-year-old, while Miguel, 8-year-old, uses eight-year-old.
José Juan, 14 years old, missed tennis, so a couple of weights of five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help really make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign Search for a King Mago, giving a player or effective in the Northwest receipt.
Fourteen detained drug traffickers
Wednesday, in Estria, a decade of persecution has been conducted in the context of the dismantalation of a Cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen persons have been arrested in various accusations.
The persecution has occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where drug production was carried out.
"Cannabis plants, four pounds of hachis, money and equipment for production have been covered," states Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security Porter.
In total, 11 men and three women have been arrested, including the two leaders of the network, two of Sherbrooke men.
The prisoners had to appear in the Sherbrooke Justice palace in the next hours of their arrest.
Cannabis' production accusations could be held, in particular in possession with the aim of trading, complot and stealing services, among others.
These persecutions have been carried out after a long investigation that has lasted nearly a year.
"The information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out arrests," Mr. Ruel needs.
In this police operation they participated about seventy agents of the Strategy Research Module for the Security of Quebec, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Department of Memprémagog Police.
You can fight clandestine without problems
The draft law of conservators that, as the Government is, should solve the problem of the fathers charged with clandestines, it will certainly be a great opposition, since the three parties of the opposition have announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I'm primarily based on the Charter."
"I meet here with a party that created the grain you're pissing," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, around the Members after the weekly celebration of the cacus.
Liberals determine that the draft legislation in their current form, which would allow any person identified as transport of Clandestin immigrants to stop until one year, infringes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that it could not support the project of law because it pointed to the wrong white.
"We are against and, it seems, all parties of opposition are against the project, so we will see what the Government does," Mr Duceppe said.
The NPD's criticism in immigration, Olivia Chow, has made the criticisms that indicate that their party is not sufficiently firm with Clandestin immigrants.
"The Neodemocrats agree that measures are adopted against the responsible for clandestin fathers and that is what we intend with another law project, C-35," says Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the draft law of the conservators because he attacks the repeateds and arrests the children for a minimum of a year," explains Ms. Chow.
The Ministry of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position of playing politicians and to make a mistake of the will of the Canadians.
"The great majority of the Canadians say to the Members who do not tolerate this kind of clandestinity, these criminal operations against Canada and who treat the country as if it was a failure."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," Minister Kenney states.
The Government has not announced a confidence vote on its draft law, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its responsibility.
However, a conservator has communicated to the QMI Agency that the Government would request the conclusion of a vote so that each member who is going to oppose would be later explained to its electors.
The new unit does not obtain singleness
Although the possible creation of a permanent unit of combating corruption and collusion by Jean Charest has been announced, many observers continue to ask the establishment of a public consultation committee on the matter.
The Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been proposed two days ago: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York since January last year.
Metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Thus, the Tuesday announcement has been shot by surprise to more than one.
It should be said that during a permanent Council on the police services of Quebec held last 29 October, this measure has never been discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
That was enough for the crystal of the party to deal with the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as "a bone out of the chister" and "a chaperous solution for the last hour".
The Dutil Minister has, on its own, answered those fearing that political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," it simply indicates.
"We are conscious of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, there is nothing that can substitute the establishment of a public investigation.
"How much more Mr. Charest obstacles to avoid the creation of this research committee, how much more people have our opinion, i.e. that he has something to hide," explains.
"The only way to have a research committee is with Jean Charest's dimission," explains Yves Boisvert, ethical teacher and management of the National Public Administration School.
To get out of this dead point, he suggests Quebec to provide a special mandate to the general interventor to carry out an investigation on colusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the general interventor," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the interventor the same competences as a Commissioner, allowing him thus to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent table is not the only project in wine in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to modify the criminal code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request seems to be from the charger of the Marteau operation, which has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Ministry of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed by its part that his homolog Rob Nicholson is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this subject.
Although the criminal code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Later, Ottawa impulsed the adoption of the gangsterism Law.
Streams under extreme monitoring
Various water courses are being monitored nearly because of the strong precisions registered in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
Wednesday afternoon a land run in Shawinigan, Maurice.
As a preventive measure, the houses have been evacuated.
On the night, there was another land running in Saint-Lin-Laurientides, Lanaudière.
A road was shot.
Since Tuesday to Tuesday night, several regions have registered strong precepts, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Furthermore, between 20 and 40 millimeters are expected from now to Thursday by night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the River and the Valley of Outaouais were the most affected.
They could get up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these prescriptions are set up to the snow loss that has already been accumulated in certain sectors, it is afraid that several rivers are overflowing.
On midnight, Quebec's civil security unit issued warnings for the Ouareu and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and from Chéne, in Lotbinière, have already caused inundations in the past and are under surveillance.
In Lanaudière's region, strong prehiptions have caused some lakes to be crossed in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the strong rain has dragged a temporary pool.
As a measure of prevention, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the disturbance of certain lakes has caused the closure of several ways, particularly in the Mansfield-et-Pontefract municipality.
The civil security unit remains warning and monitoring the nearby situation, Annik Bouchard, security adviser, has been indicated.
The Prevision Centre of Quebec growth, on its part, issued announcements on Wednesday by communicating the strong growth of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Culpan Partly to Dupont
The Quebec Stéphane Dupont radio presenter has suffered a certain reverse to the Canadian Council of the Radio Television Standards (CCNR) by controversy statements concerning social assistance and haitian as well as by its gross language in the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an unfairly negative representation of Haitians and greedy languages that should not be used in divisions during the day".
The Council also pointed out that the debates on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had suicided, do not infringe the radio-diffusion codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints in relation to the comments made in divisions between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a complaint from the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the quantities mentioned in the emission were not correct.
The presentors must communicate reliable data, not that lead to error.
In relation to suicide, the present Stéphane Dupont had demonstrated that suicide was a cobarde act.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the transmission message was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes of "Dupont le midi" have discussed a delegated issue in a fair and appropriate way."
Therefore, any fault has been rejected in this regard.
The last offence was referring to the statements made after the Haiti terremount.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were protagonizing a median reaction that had raised many reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that it had not made any donations to help the Haitians because I could not know safely whether the needed would really receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that its cumulative effect is an unexpected negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension there."
"My document has been held for a half and a half years ago," said the present.
In all decisions, the Committee denied the emission of green language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has cooperated "more than required".
The consequences will be minimum for the ́ora, which, inter alia, should be announced once in the hours of greater audience within a period of three days.
A King of the Kung-fu in Montreal
The spectacular of Argelian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely specific recycling.
The athlete, which highlights in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and thai box, is up to the tattoos and rings of the world seeking new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," Zemmal explained, who lives in metropolis since 2008 to progress at the professional level.
"In my case, I look for fights everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground that involve mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The atleta, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS firm, has recently given bad news to his rivals, wining two gold medals in the World Amateur Campeonate of the World Karate and Kickboxing Others (WKA), celebrated from 23 to 30 October in Edimburg, .
"I won in the category of kickboxing full contact and thai box," explained.
"I'm currently prepared to participate in the World Cop of San Shoo in China."
"They will invite sporters who have ended between the four first places in the last world campaign in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I ended the tournament at fifth place, but I reached the third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I went progressing in every competition."
"In this step, I'll be the first this time or the next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a originating discipline from China in which it is allowed to go with the pounds and feet, as well as to lay the opposers on the ground.
The employment is originally celebrated on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most pugilist in this kind of fight is the American vietnamita Cung Le origin, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only keep a competition in his career, he will certainly accuse the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bo of the kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorial and prestigious in China," explains the famous boy.
"It is like the equivalent to Lumpinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"There was an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of its category (80 kg), but lost at the end.
"He who has won me is a real professional," he advises.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"Semifinal winners are at the end of their category."
"Therefore, the campaigns of each category are to crown a single campaign, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without claims
Hydro-Quebec has granted direct contracts for a value of $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
In the center of this evaluation of more than 100 contracts, a consortium is made by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, which has been obtained without a claim before the most important contract, the project management, by a sum of 295 million.
The consortium called Energie gerance was created in 2004 based on Hydro-Quebec's decision to confide to the private sector its responsibility for the management of this important project of 5.000 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy management consortium obtained the profitable contract without a previous public invitation.
For the Partie, the resource to company consorties is a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and to cause a higher price.
"This is a new method of collusion and elimination of competition."
"I mean, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," said the Deputy of the Quebec Party yesterday in a press road.
Before the morning, Mr Simard asked the question at the national Assembly because he does not understand how it can benefit from public interest in this way.
The Ministry of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded at the afternoon, refusing strongly that a colusion with this contract had occurred.
"People to conscious me," she protested, defending that the PQ had acted in a way "deshonest" and "with a lack of rigor".
He indicated that "the minimum" would be that the PQ would apologize.
The formula of consorcies is a common practice worldwide.
Normally, it is a alliance with a temporary limit that allows two or several companies to group their knowledge to respond to an invitation for a completed project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of fullness, taking into account the size of works.
Works have already been started and will take up until 2012.
In all cases, the contract has been granted without entering competition; it has been negotiated.
Furthermore, the consortium formula has ceased to be the imprisonment of the standard in Quebec, even for simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of consortiums in the technical advisory sector is subject to research in the Government.
A quick view of Quebec's market record allows you to identify more than 200 consorts, of which some seem to be permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in association with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are tens of them, leads to one single legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the Energia gerrance consortium, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the Bahia territory of James responds to a special work dynamic and Hydro-Quebec responses specifically to it since the 1970s".
The Great Chief of the Eastmain Project, Real Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), has explained that it has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been directly granted.
"If you answer an invitation and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can contact the actors in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and a good price."
"The idea, however, is that what is important is not the price, but the competition of people," Mr Laporte said.
The contract granted to the Energy management consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $500,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After checking, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their branches, in particular geotics.
SNC-Lavalin has received 22 contracts, Genivar has received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energy management.
All contracts were negotiated.
Totally, $449.783.344, including the Energy management contract of $295.13.564.
Sylvain Simard has understood that the four companies who form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "good known to the Quebec Liberal Party".
The Minister Normandeau has allowed that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" before it needs to be better addressed to its leaders.
Required consumption barometer. The "green" tag does not inspire trust
More ecological, but deeply skeptic.
The consumer is only trusted in sustainable development actors, as well as in the right trade marks, and in the ecological certificates to guide their elections.
The Barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, is the situation still worse. The consumer is summarized in a median universe where messages that defeat a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers it even breaches its commitment.
Even if it has increased the consumption of products called "socially responsible" in 2010, the Quebequens seem to give very little credit to those who sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of the companies or the publicists of them, reveal the tool for me developed by the Observatory of Consumption Responsible of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other conclusion: half of consumers doubts the reliability of the official certificates that carry the rightly called products, as well as the credibility of the products and labels that carry labels indicating that they are "efficient", states the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of the Quebecans are seriously taking the talks of the politicians on this issue.
In any case, information on the responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, currently supported by nearly one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the laguns and the doubtful character of the information make 46% of consumers reject this option.
It is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer after the highest price of these products.
Furthermore, a third of the Quebequens say to disbeliev also the sustainable performance of the ecological products or services that are sold to them.
On the other hand, nearly half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the marking of one or several products to respect their convictions.
A 61% has given a priority to purchases in the tents of your apartment and has preferred buying food cultivated in its region, states the Barometer.
More green and responsible (the responsible consumption has reached 64 points over a hundred points this year), the Quebec Consumus Homo loves to occupy the position of the king of the recycling that reduces its impact on the environment is concerned about the protection of the fauna.
However, the Barometer, that social conscience seems to be doors (of its car) outside: in 2010 only 28% of the Quebequens indicated that they used public transport or have had a car to defend their principles.
Furthermore, 39.1% of the participants of this broad behaviour investigation, which just completed their first and responsibility, supports the use of the bicycle and staff movements.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, whom they have requested to engage financially in the recovery of eXcentris cinema compounds, accepts to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Development Society and the Parallelle, who expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois, completed the eXcentris cinematographic in the Saint-Laurent bulletin and have not received what they asked.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but in its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would actually be less than the initial expectations; it could constitute a sustainable solution in favourable conditions, at least in view of certain public employees.
Quebec had already increased the early past a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then the applications have been revised.
The President of the Cultural Development Society (SODEC), François Macerola, managing the eXcentris document, submitted a proposal and a action plan to the Minister of St. Peter.
He sent her a last report a decade ago.
However, SODEC received a contraproposal proposal from the office on Tuesday.
The Parallelle and Others have a term until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the opportunity of a donation of the State should be completely dismissed.
Remember that the Association of cinematics owners and Quebec's film graphics was opposed to a direct investment of the State to support eXcentris recovery, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance immobiliary projects, since it did not do it with other cinema rooms.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector have requested a significant economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of his owner, has carryed for ten years the carrying of the author cinema in its places of the compound, after financing its own construction, which could justifie a derogation by the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent movies results patent in Montreal and eXcentris had known to loyalize their client.
Company and the Parallèle, guided by Christian Yaccarini, are providing a private financing campaign, expecting to gather $700,000 to open the way to purchase.
Since early 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallelle, has continued to project movies in eXcentris.
The objective of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, projecting the precious film of Xavier Beauvois "Des Humans and des dies".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not yet contacted Levoir and we don't know what he and his group of proposals to the lower they have received.
Canadian's sight is raised up...
The new diplomatic cables and ́s distributed by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States consider as the completion of the Canadians with regard to the e ́s, but reflect at the same time the feeling of superiority of these last to Canada.
The diplomatics and appeals are surprised that Canadian electors do not think of the United Canadian relations when they vote and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative Government to ensure that their budget was approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the ambassador and Ottawa and Washington that have been published yesterday offer more playing details that really constituently contain.
A cable of 22 September 2008, which is, during the full federal electoral campaign, relates to how far the United States do not enter into the issues discussed by the political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the ambassador and sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations about this situation.
"It may be that political leaders are conditioned by a total of almost inferiority to the Canadians at the time of dealing with daily home issues, rather than to leave such choices to the United States (as during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign). "
Consequently, the United States are "the proverb elefant of this election: all representative, but potentially too dangerous to talk about him."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "encouraging silence" because both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logically, I think, the ability of a candidate, of a party and, more, of the head of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which electors should think at the time of voting."
This feeling of importance can also be observed by Terry Breese sent on January 22, 2009 to prepare President Barack Obama for its first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will contribute to guarantee the over-government during the vote of confidence to the beginning of February on the Federal Budget, through which Canada will first register deficit in the last decade due to a plan of recovery of $30,000 to $40,000," wrote Mr Breese.
Nowhere is mentioned that the Government had to prolong the Parliament before Christmas to avoid replaced its coalition or that the parties of opposition had granted its super-quality to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication from January 2008 signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns to Washington on the more negative image that transmits the dramatic series distributed in the United States CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the emission of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtil references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even to the sequestres so that it performs an energy inquiry.
Another cable notes that, during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French homolog Bernard Kouchner whether Europe would be willing to accept some prisoners in Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered that, but he depended "of every case".
At the end of the term, they wrote, "he has delivered a document to the State Secretariat concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim."
"The Secretariat accepted revising the document."
Finally, we can mention that the animations have been heated with regard to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a very close adviser of Stephen Harper, stated in the CBC radio that the responsible for this massive flight should be "made".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee's echo is made.
A global plan to renew the ilumination
Yesterday, the United Nations has proposed a plan for renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial ilumination in hundred countries to reduce the inver-effect gas (GEI) in Cancún in a quantity that corresponds almost to a third of the additional reduction that should be carried out to stabilize the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan is focused on a set of large concrete projects that the United Nations expects to be adopted in Cancún to compensate the lack of commitments to reduction in industrialized countries.
The plan submitted yesterday, if the incandescent bombs, which still monopolise between 50 and 70% of the market, are replaced by fluocompact bombs or, even better, by electroluminescent diodes bombs (DEL or "LED" in English), would be avoided a large part of the 1.800 million tonnes of GEI (Gt) issued on the planet to illustrate humans.
Ilumination is responsible for 8% of the worldwide.
It is the equivalent to 70% of the planetary car park's ions.
In Copenhagen, last year, the large countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed voluntary reduction plans to reduce GEI global ions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of that quantity should be decreased to stabilize, before 2020, the increasing temperature in two degrees to avoid discontrol.
In the incandescent bombs, 95% of energy is disciplined in the form of warmth and the rest, namely, 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bombs, energy expenditure is reduced to 75% and with the new LED bombs, the energy consumption is still two times more reduced.
Fluocompact bombs take an average of 6.000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bombs, such as the Philips manufacturer has launched this week (a company who has also participated in UN study), have a life hope of 25,000 hours and consume a 80% less energy than an incandescent bomb, which allows us to make an idea of the relief that can be achieved with the substitution plan that would be applied in hundred countries.
These new bombs can also operate with resistants and educate very little warm.
On the above, they don't contain anything of mercury.
Various specialists have demonstrated their reservations in relation to fluocompact bombs, since they contain mercury and that they must be removed as dangerous residues, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of emissions of mercury on the planet is not fluocompact bombs, but carbon thermal centres, which issue a large quantity of mercury to produce electricity that is disrupted with incandescent bombs.
Only in the United States, these centrals issue 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report describes the benefits that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would be requiring in this way a billion million dollars per year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent to 3.5 term centers whose construction would cost 2.500 million.
Cost of Marfil anxiously expects the announcement of electoral results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the " immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Costa de Marfil, since the fixed terms have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral committee to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," highlights a portfolio of the United Nations head.
"Request all Costa de Marfil partys and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and avoid any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exercised by some foreign governments, the electoral committee has allowed the term of midnight to midnight without publishing the results, three days from Saturday's slavery.
About 40 minutes before the end of the term, the CEI Chairman had commented on the television that the committee was "continuing working" to announce the results.
Wednesday, the requests that the CEI finally announces the name of the winner of the second flight between Laurent Gbagbo output and his or her or her Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo band has the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the new forces (FN) from the failure of the State of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the President of Costa de Marfil, has said that the intimidation manuals of the electors carried out in the north of the country had disappointed the followers of the outside president to vote.
All elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opposers consider that the highest court of the country is not neutral, since it is addressed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a nearest political alien of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north, who sent any relationship with the ancient rebels, has judged "inacceptable" the delay in the publication of the results and requested Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to restore the victory.
Its allocations are that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that he has submitted a complaint to the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral committee to spread the results would be illegal.
The second turn of the presidency, on Sunday, should have led to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a divided country in two years ago.
United Nations have warned on Wednesday to the Coast of Marph that they could be considered responsible for possible violence acts.
Laurent Gbagbo had ended on 31 October with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, which was publicly supported by ancient President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first hour).
The rate of unemployment remains stabil in France in the third quarter
The International Working Organization (OIT), the rate of unemployment in France has been established at 9.3% in the continental territory (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected by the provisional stational variations (CVE) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of stops remains in 2.630,000 in the continental France.
The data of the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the active population in the continental territory and 9.7% with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has registered an increase of 0.1 points.
Generally, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they wanted to work, or are not available in the two weeks to work and search for or not employment.
The situation of young people present on the labour market has continued to decrease, with a new rate of unemployment up to 24.2% in the continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including DOMs.
The third quarter, 637.000 young people from 15 to 24 years of age were stopped in the meaning of the OIT.
On its part, a low increase in the parish between advanced age persons has been recorded to 6.4% in the continental France (+0.2 points in three months and in one year), namely, 482.000 people of over 50 years, numbering 6.6% with DOMs.
It has only been registered a stability between age people between 25 and 49, with 8.3% in the continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all France.
The Insee has taken from 2006 without publishing the rate of the par men, after a polemic on its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency, continues to do it and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (included DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53-year-old director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rhône Council, is being investigated and captured in the prison of Luynes, nearby Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of a research on public contracts supposedly fraudulently.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated by abuse of social goods, misconduct of funds and public goods, covering, active corruption, trafficking of influenzas and municipalities, it is indicated by its lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and will answer all the questions the judge asks, not fantasms."
"It is easy to make it easy for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is demonstrating them," he said to the AFP her lawyer, Florence Rault, before its client appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to send his lawyers to the judge before his appearance a document to explain.
On Wednesday night, they began to investigate and also prisoned one of their neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi.
It is your lawyer, Mr Lucien Simon, the only thing that your customer has done was to take care of the guards that should be managed.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to its implementation, he does not know anything about it, it is said letter Simon.
In the context of this document, it is also investigated since Wednesday, Daniel Pinna, ex-General Director of Aubagne's urban aglomeration services, for misconversion of funds and complication, but has left him in conditional freedom and has meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached you."
"The judge of the instructor has taken into account the explanations and has left it free," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Wednesday night, four other people were interviewed and left freedom, under judicial control in the case of two of them, was indicated by the added fiscal of the Republic, Michael Raffin.
Michael Karabadjakian, added Director-General of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of "trade of influenza and passive corruption".
Two officials of Aubagne's agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringier, have been interviewed by "subtraction and malversation of public goods by a person dedicated to the public service" and "complication in the misconversion of public funds", respectively.
Finally, the company of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, is investigated by "covering the abuse of social goods".
Among those who have been held to Mr Guérini figure Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently prisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corcega.
Researchers suspect that their companies have a service to blame the capital of the large bandidism.
The investigation is conducted in the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 after receiving anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A close to the research source points out that research is particularly focused on the conditions for the allocation and functioning of a crowd in La Ciotat, which collects Aubagne waste and other cities of the city community of Marsella (MPM).
Subject Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has increased Syria's mediation
More than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, Clotilde Reiss' destination, the young French investigation arrested in Iran by "spionage", has been in disappointment to the public in France, has warned the diplomacy and has emphasized the deterioration of relations between Paris and Teheran.
Everything under the attention of the United States diplomatics.
The documents and documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elizabeth has explained his strategy to the eggs until the point of giving them advice to manage their own "rehenes" crisis in Iran (a small group of passengers).
They show how the French responsibles convinced Washington that the freedom of the French young woman was not made in exchange for the freedom of ̈id Kakavand, a Iranian arrested in France and seeked by justice and by material trafficking for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the cruel reality of how the French president tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, had played a essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram edited on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the title "Iran: French comments on how to handle the cases of rehenes".
Eliseo's adviser for Strategic Affairs, François Richer, accompanied by the Director of Qui d'Orsay to North Africa and Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talk with diplomatic and Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain to you the French method.
They advise those who do the following to repatriate their own citizens holding force in Iran.
"Haced sound," they say, "continue" in the media, the words "based human rights", "inocence", "instant release".
Everything to shame the Iranian regime, careful of your image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often."
Because, once negotiated by discrete channels, "the silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "experts in dilatory hands".
Mr. Richier adds that detention of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactic: rehenes for political changing".
It announces that the freedom of prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will be held on 16 August, on the day in which it will be re-embarked in France) will "require submission to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros).
Furthermore, it notes that Eliseo predicts other rehenes crisis, a phenomenon that "will increase".
The Iranians could "in a nearby future arrest one of the nearly 1.800 French citizens living in Iran."
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Kings goes out of prison after twelve days, but is locked in Iran.
The following information is distributed: the Iraniid Kakavand, whose additional requests by the United States for illegal traffic of electronic material delegated to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge.
The ambassador and, as many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, near the Iranian clandestiness networks of material purchasing for the nuclear program, the capture of §id Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted a exchange?
Free Iranian in exchange of French?
A new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richer guarantees that it wasn't like this.
Elizabeth, not only "the judge's decided greatly", but has opposed itself.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister for Justice" (in the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "The French Government cannot cancel the decision" states the justice.
Mr. Richer also wants to demonstrate that Kakavand continues under the "est" monitoring of French information services.
Eliseo's adviser marks a number of phones, coalga and then reports the diplomatic and that the Iranian is currently in a Paris building managed by the Iranian ambassador.
The detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Eliseo does not escape efforts, use communications and "fucks" organized in the media to believe that the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The e-mails observe this activity with a certain irony and check that the manipulation brings its fruits, since several press articles transmit the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to the "medium-blitz" of the French officers.
What such "gratitude" should be given to Mr. Assad, the ambassador in Paris is asked.
"Despite their full declarations of praise, the French officers recognize in private that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then addresses the reasons that have led to Elizabeth to put up this figure.
The great effort to communicate "this aims to validate Sarkozy's opening policy towards Syria," he advises.
A policy started in 2008, which "in view of a number of critical voices in France and the foreign, was just cut off of pre-mature and dismerced".
When "reducing the Syrian role", Paris" shows Syria's skills that can grow if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The goal also consists of "seeming the seed of discouragement between Syria and Iran".
The ambassador and it knows of good source.
On August 11, François Richer trusted you: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But in all ways, if we thank him."
"It should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Eliseo.
In a communication, thank the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for having performed a "active paper for the freedom of our partner".
From midnight, young Koreans cannot play online
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "of the Cecience" that will impede adolescents to join online games after middle-night blocking their access, which has been indicated by government responsibility.
In December, a draft law will be submitted to Parliament to request online games to block access to these games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, which has been indicated by representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Multium children play all night and then it's difficult to study at school and take a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect its health and the right to dream," AFP Jo Rin, responsible for the draft law.
Online games will be available again at the morning six.
Companys will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, precisely.
The Government is also urged to ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games when the parents of the young ones so ask it, the responsible added.
Furthermore, it will be available to anyone who requests free informal programs that allow the Internet connection time to limit.
South Korea is one of the "the most" countries and the newspapers regularly give news about various facts linked to an intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the inadmissible campaign of global competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea obtained four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, where it was held to other 58 countries.
World 2018-2022: FIFA designates organising countries
In the middle of the storm caused by corruption suspects, the FIFA Executive Committee designs Thursday to the World Cops organizing countries of 2018 and 2022, a clear political choice where influenza and lobbying fights can reach primary technical criteria.
One thing is clear, 2018's competition of the FIFA will be celebrated in Europe, traditional bastard of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Netherlands-Belgica).
The 2022 e will be much more exotic, since the International Federation expects to win new territory (Qatar, ○a), after a stranger in the African continent in 2010, or to promote its implantation in the United States or the remote East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar's emission, Belgian and Netherlands Government Chiefs, Zidane, Beckham, ○yff) tests the economic and political interests playing in a World.
The transactions between bastards, therefore, may last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
The FIFA evaluation report is set out, English, Spanish and Portuguese candidatures (2018) and and (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of voting.
Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to a corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Themerii and Amos Adamu), could have destroyed the opportunities of his country, with football, which only accepted the World once in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the house on Monday by spreading a documentary that has proved to three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
It's enough to disappoint the FIFA and shame the English responsibles, who have been cast to a intense lobbying in the last weeks with David Cameron at the head.
The Government Boss expects to re-edit the hit given successfully by his precedent, Tony Blair, which had achieved in 2005 the JJ.O. 2012 organization for London.
This intense activity, will it be enough to restore England's resources before the EC?
It is not clear, since Spain-Portugal also has many strong points thanks to its stages, ready, his experience (Mundial of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Europe Copa in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadows of both countries could be ambitional.
Possible repressions against English and doubts on Spain and Portugal solvency are the only way to give points to Russia, converted into an outside of weight despite the laguns in their candidature (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and claimed a "disloyal competence in the preparation of the vote" in a direct statement to the claims of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They're getting out to relight their sucking traps, committing them," Putin advised.
For 2022, the United States, who have experience in 1994, seems to be the most logic favorites.
The first global economic power and the seat of the main FIFA patrocinators, the country seems to have benefited Japan and South Korea, which have developed a great project separately.
However, these new candidatures seem to be preliminary for two countries who have organized the campaign together in 2002.
Other risks: the conceition of the World 2026 to China, which was strictly desired by the FIFA, which would cause Asia to remain without possibilities for 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its basic project is in future stages, and it is it that the FIFA would promote its extension to new hours, but both countries have more risks than certainty.
Like Japan and Korea, it could also be harmed by the deficiency of payed TV rights (in terms of time distinction) by the European countries, the backspan of war for the FIFA.
Second mandate: test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had given it to understand that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less yet.
A mandate in Elizabeth leads to another.
Therefore, the current State leader will again be candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this is not well combined with the mystery often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that it is doubtful.
To one side and to the other side.
In 2006, though they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends didn't reject a third mandate.
On November 15, in serious tonne, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would take his decision "at some time in August 2011".
Thus, the fact that you treat UMP members on Tuesday night in Elizabeth, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused a certain revision.
Is this the official announcement of your candidature?
Not much less.
The Chairman only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited the number of five-year mandates to two.
He simply transmitted the facts, not an announcement.
It's not the first time to talk about the presidents, with a jokes ton, in meetings of this type.
"In the worst, or better, in the cases, you will still pass seven and half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010, "Don't think I'm not going to plan myself what's going to come after."
His fronts are no longer closer to the candidature, nor less.
They submit comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the career for the candidature in the PS, on one side.
But it is not the fact that Segolène Royal has ascended to the palette that brings Nicolas Sarkozy to sincerely.
In contrast, the fact that its candidature in 2012 is evident is that leads to many PS people to claim that the battle is organized before the planned.
On the other hand, the bad sondees.
For the first time, de electors prefer the candidature of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy ( 46% against 44%, is BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the subject in the UMP," the Prime Minister's environment repeatedly and immediately.
"If you think you can, you will not be candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
"You'll always think you can win," Alain Juppé corrects, resigned before the evidence.
Euro: The ECB looks obligated to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The final Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be allowed to identify the methods of output of the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
Because of the crisis of the European Sovereign Debt, Frankfurt's emissions institution cannot certainly be allowed to be so peregrinous if he does not want to risk a more complicated situation than today on European obligations markets.
The political cost would be equal to high.
Yesterday, during a pressing road, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has supported the active role played by the ECB in favour of the crisis of debt of the European States.
He did not mean if he thought that the central should do more, for example, increased its program for the purchase of State obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my European companions."...
The winter, in Brussels, during its audience before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more famous about its intentions, indicating only that the program for purchasing Letters of the State on the secondary market was "continued" and that "We will see what we decided" during June.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main type of inevitable at 1%, the lowest level of his history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of the Treasury obligations by the ECB has been duplicated last week until approximately EUR 1.350 million.
Furthermore, if it were the indiscrete market operators, it would have bought Irish and Portuguese titles again yesterday.
In total, the euro's central instruments have bought titles for a amount of EUR 67,000 million since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that the purchase will be followed (see page 29).
Economys also do not prevent any significant changes in the course.
Although loan operations for more than three months have been disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, they still carry out unlimited liquidity allocations in beneficial conditions and periods that varie between one and three months.
Economys expect this device to be extended today for a few months.
"I don't imagine I'm going to change your program."
"If not, it would be the risk of provoking new short-term pressures," says Michael Schubert, the Commerzbank economy.
"It seems more like a progressive outcome announced during the first quarter of 2011," he predicted by his side Norbert Brams, economicist in Sal.
Uppenheim.
As regards interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB should keep a buying volume of those obligations to maintain the market stability," adds Norbert Brams.
Taking into account the importance of the exposures of Europeans to the euro area's sovereign debts markets, the emission institution has no more option than to maintain its presence on the market.
"You must compensate any price the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that prevents a highlighted marking of the most fragile income by the States," a major obligation manager said yesterday.
Because, if the interest rates are placed in the clouds, the States will have even more problems to reduce their debt, or even to stabilize it.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
In Italy, the Government of Berlusconi leads to the time
After Italy has started the week in an anxious way, the situation has easily improved yesterday with the reflux of the obligation rates at 10 years.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
At the outcome of a position with the Ministry of Economy, regional presidents have heard Giulio Tremonti calify the situation of "unciphable" and expected a weekend "imprese" statements later denied by the interested.
In any case, the difference between the German long-term rates had reached the record number of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of cebra (CRQ) had been shot up to 263 points, providing a certain review in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German types was greater than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" for "the turbulences in the markets" and for a possible county from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economicist in the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the delay of the income associated with it, which causes the State to risk that the needs of financing are not able to face.
The latest previsions of Brussels have made a cold water chain for the government.
It is estimated that the Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on a number of 1.3% and 2% respectively.
In these conditions, the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of the BDP in the next year (with 3.9% of the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
The vote that new budgetary provisions may be applied after feasts, for a amount of EUR 7.000.
"If necessary, new outermost measures should be taken," opinions the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, O日 Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The bases of its economy are in order and their accounts in good state, as we have been saying for a while," Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator in the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the FMI.
"There is no immediate problem, or short or long-term, because, despite its considerable debt (119.2% of the PIB in 2011, NDLR), the efforts requested for stabilising in Italy are less than those required to other countries," comments Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD's head economy.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be held to a censure motion in the House of Members, after which elections could be predicted at the end of March.
In that case, a little favourable period would be opened to make decisions in case of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has repeated it yesterday during a pressing road in Paris: "I think we have already demonstrated on Sunday, by night and day, that the Europeans are clearly solid, decided, committed with the defence of their currency and their monetary area."
Although it was related, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the rate of European States' obligations has encouraged governments and ECB.
However, we can not yet talk about a standardization principle.
The Standard & Poor's Classification Agency announced that Portugal's debt assessment could be reduced, the most frequent white in the present speculations.
"So as in May, really lack of clearness and political transparency, which is significantly weakening on the systems," said the Economys of Exane BNP Paris.
Especially because "political rythm is much slower than market rythm".
Conscious of this hazard and the dangers he hides, the European countries intensify the debates to strengthen existing crisis output mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the Ministers of Finance which seem to be more directly affected and generally with G-20's homologs are a good way.
This also takes into account Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of the next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
In the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries in the market coliminator (see above).
As regards the European Financial Stability Fund (FEEF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has started on Tuesday in Singapore a resort from Asia to inform the remote East investors about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the goal of these visits is not to recover funds, it is certainly prepared for the land.
It is expected that the first ions of the FEEF titles be performed in the next month.
Yesterday, an official representative and trusted the Re-Agency that the United States would support a potential increase in mobilised funds through an additional direct commitment of the FMI.
As regards the countries in the first line, Portugal and Spain, these are prepared to adopt reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the work market.
These reforms are subject to the outermost measures with a closer effect.
Lisboa and Madrid want to go on a different way than Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid any coast to ask for international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and to decide the reforms that they consider necessary to enhance the trust in a long-term way.
The European Funds' capitalist partners finally have the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of public obligations markets.
On 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to start the idea that if the 750,000 million euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not doubt to return to the portfolio.
Economys of Barclays Capital, a first-line actor on the European public debt market, consider that an amount of about 100 million additional euros would be sufficient, "preferebly" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European mechanism for financial stability, currently charged with EUR 60,000 million.
An advice that, of course, could deploy European capitals.
In particular, market conditions are increasing.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in warning
Snows are still providing difficulties in employment, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are in warning because of the risk of snow and ice training.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments already in warning, tenteen from midnight to midnight and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group by night.
See weather France, strong snow falls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows easily in France Island.
Some snow layers are expected between 2 and 5 cm, pointly between 7 and 10 cm in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of low Normandia, France Island and Lemosin.
The snows are sufficiently strong as to cause difficulties of employment and to affect some economic activities, France Warning.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been made to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion axes and Saint-Brie-Loudeac.
The gendarms are, the secondary network of Britain is complicated, so they recommend that it not be driven unless necessary and that certain TER vehicles have been used during the day.
Wednesday, school transport was held in Picardia.
No specific measures were expected on Wednesday night to limit heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all drivers to carry out the highest ability on the roads and to adapt their leading to the situation".
The Director-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested aircraft companies to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights in the Paris Port of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the proposed snows.
The DGAC recommends air passengers to contact their line.
In Great Britain, Gatwick port, south of London, and Edimburg, in  ♪  ♪, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro del Grand Paris: first financial eraser
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the France Island has reached its vital point, there are thousands of millions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we talk about 23,000 million for the Grand Paris metro to build the Grand Paris Societé.
In order to initiate this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of EUR 4.000 million.
At the theoretical level, this sum will later allow SGP to receive loans on the markets to finance a part of its double bulk.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Corrective Finance Act, examined in the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the devices intended to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the tax on offices in the France Island.
First, we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Societé du Grand Paris".
Moreover, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
The second is an amendment of a tax on offices already existing "to modernise it, to increase its product and to determine that increase in the Societé du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No encryption is given in the text.
But it's far from 4.000 million.
"Tax resources are needed to be added to the 4.000 million euros of the allocation of funds that the State will mobilize and will be granted to the Grand Paris Society as the project progresses," we can read in the exhibition of reasons.
The SGP doesn't surprise this system.
"From the time income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover studies for three years and then receive the 4.000 million later, we explain."
"He shall be registered in the budget and shall be used according to the needs."
The SGP calculates that it will start receiving the 4.000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4.000 million promised are not in the credit, can lead to a lightly enhanced parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on 7 December.
Hackers winners and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks matter has a double value.
On the one hand, it shows an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandal to the hypocresy that rules the relationships between States, citizens and press.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes to international scale and provides a future dominated by the regression.
But we're going to pass.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of that each document created by a secret service (independently from the nation to which it belongs) is formed by press curves.
The "extraordinary" revelations and §s on Berlusconi's sexual habits reflect only what has been written for months in any period (excluding those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's syneticly ridiculising profile has long been given ideas to cabaret artists to create their schetches.
The standard is that secret documents should only be formed by public knowledge news is essential for the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to isothern publications, you will see that each work repeat (of the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templarios or the Rosacruz) exactly what was written in the previous works.
This is not only the fact that hidden text authors would not want to do unnecessary research (or they don't know where to find news about the inexistence), but because those who dedicate themselves to ocultism trust not only in what they already know, which reaffirms what they have already done.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret documents.
The reporter is perezous, as it is perezous (or has little anxiety) the head of secret services (if it couldn't be, I know what, Redactor of Liberation), which only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent the ambassador and Rome to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published last week.
Then why have such revisions caused the revelations of these documents?
On the one hand, they only say what everyone cultivated already knows, namely, that the ambassadors, at least since the Second World War, and since the heads of the State can be called by a phone or taking the plane to meet, have lost their diplomatic role and have been transformed into spinner centres by some restricted exercises.
What spectator you see research movies know perfectly, we just appear that we don't know it for hypocresy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly infringes the debt of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of diplomacy and Others.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most powerful secrets of the world's most powerful country's secrets is to consider the prestigiation of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "verdugues".
But we enter the true nature of what happened.
Earlier, in Orwell's time, it could be designed to all power as a Big Brother who controled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has become real since, by controlling every movement by the phone, every transaction made, visited hotel, self-pist taken, the citizen became thus a complete victim of the power's eyes.
But when it is shown, as it happens now, that even if the encryptions of power secrets cannot escape from the control of a hacker, the control relationship stops to be undirective and returns.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the winner of the citizens) can know all the secrets of the power.
How can you endure a power that can't save your own secrets anymore?
It is true, as already said Georg Simmel, that a true secret is a empty secret (and a empty secret can never be discovered); it is also true that all knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, because it comes from the public area; but revealing, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove all power.
WikiLeaks didn't hurt anybody to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is evident that in the future, States will no longer put any booked information on the network, as it would be like to publish it on a full road portfolio.
But it is also evident that, with current technologies, it cannot be expected to keep confidential conversations on the phone.
Nothing is easier to discover if and when a State Boss has moved in a plane and has been contacted with one of the homologs.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly that my prevision is at this time a thing of science fiction, and therefore, newly, but I imagine governmental agents who are discretely moved into diligences with incontrolable it, bringing messages that have been memorized or, as much, hiding some data written in the tacons of their shoes.
This information is then stored in one single copy in key-locked boxes: at the end of the account, Watergate's spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I wrote that technology currently goes forward as a cancer, i.e. backwards.
A century after the telegraph without cables has revolutioned communications, the Internet has re-created a cables telegraph (phones).
Videos (analogics) had allowed cinema researchers to study a step-up movie, progressing and backwarding, discovering all the secrets of the mount, while now the CDs (digital) only allow to progress or return from chapter in chapter, namely, to large proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in the airplane, with the movements that he carries, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the normal way that policy and communication techniques bring us back to horses cars.
A last comment.
Earlier, the press was understood what was in secret in the ambassadors.
Currently, the ambassadors request confidential information to the press.
Climate: France's chappies in their financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the financing promises have been quickly dislocked (fast start or early) carried out by developed countries.
And the French chappies have been discovered.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries engaged in providing $30,000 million between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has committed 7.200 million euros in three years and France ≥60 million euros (e.g. 420 millions per year).
The opening of the COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment with fast-start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press road, a great additional event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was resulting in and was actually valuable: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2.200 million euros in 2010, which is the situation in the right way to fulfil its commitment of 7.200 million in 2012.
But if we study the situation delicately, things are more complicated.
The Copenhagen Agreement must be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort is made without prejudice to the official development aid.
Unfortunately, there was no agreement on what it means "new and additional".
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have locked the procedure.
Currently, everyone chooses the reference that is more agreed to it.
For example, the European Commission has taken a reference in 2009: international financing is maintained and are added to 150 million in three years as a conception of fast-start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references to the year or level of official development aid.
Furthermore, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, the expenditure of the previous years or the total level of official development aid is not referring.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even reduce) while it intends to respect its commitment to "new and additional funds"...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and each chooses the calculation method.
Some, such as France, believe that each euro granted is equal to a donated euro.
Obviously, this is difficult to justifie: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are rentable (frequently projects relating to the reduction of loans based on more effective technologies), it is fair to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to an euro that is granted... as much, only the cost of the loan for the country granting the loan (e.g. the equivalent to a type of interest).
But France does not find the reasoning: "respect" its commitment of 420 million euros by 91.5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document to see it by its own eyes.
It is the only country of the Union that so often uses the loan.
Germany uses it in 46% while Denmark, Netherlands or Slovakia, among other things, respect their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union offers a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only offers ten centimeters and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good truck!
In summary, in its fast-start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions at the time and, on the other hand, in relation to the real financial effort.
With only 36.1 million euros, it can give the impression that it expenses 420 million "new and additional" as it had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (for it seems to be Bercy who has been occupied with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give when they can simply provide?) and in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not stupid...
The chapter of precise financing is a short-term minucy in relation to the total climate negotiations.
But it could be a more sand grain in the large but would be CMNUCC.
Let's hope that it's not that way.
Whatever it is, it is vital for this first year of pre-financing.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its assessment method for 2011 and 2012, in order to respect its commitments and the other countries of the European Union.
But in particular, France could make the debates on playing awards on long-term financing (other essential chapter currently discussed): we will not be released from the question of the "additional caracter" or of the method to calculate loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive in relation to this issue as it is with others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Environment Ministry, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, that will come to Cancún the next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast starts of France and its vision of the "additional charter" and the use of loans would help to improve the international confidence level necessary to progress in negotiations.
Warning on infants injected by children
A 10-year-old child comes on a day of 81 different chemicals, indicates a study published on Wednesday by the Association Generations Futures (the former movement by rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated," bought in Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and Seven foods that often consume a child of about 10 years in four foods and a tender day.
These foods taken as a model, which respect the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three of milk products and 1.5 litres of water daily) and golosins were examined in the search for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the plate is abusive: 81 chemicals, of whom 42 classified as possible cancers or ≥ 5 and five classified substances as safe cancers, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrin pollutants (PE), are studies of various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although almost all of the cases, the legal limits for each of the individual chemical substances are not exceeded, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to potentially cancerous and/or too is anxious," points the association.
For breakfast, bottle and milk tea contains for themselves more than a decade of possible cancer residues and three considered as safe cancers, as well as near a twenty residues that can damage the hormonal system.
The brass, imported from Brazil, as scheduled for the college, contains six chemical substances, including a funicide in France.
The same applies to the Green Jews of Kenya, including food, in which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide in the EU.
Furthermore, the Russian film, the tunnel on the lat, and even the bread bar or the cycle were associated with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the water of the griff, the analysis discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
At the dinner, the salmon road was the most "nutritive" with 34 detected chemical residues and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwaves was not completely.
The final risk that generates these "contaminant cocktails" for the consumer "prove" is subestimated, says the study.
The European Ecology-Les Verts Aliance (EE-LV), on its part, has proposed to implement a moratory on the use of pesticides to breach "the increase of civilization diseases".
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (AESA) indicated the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
