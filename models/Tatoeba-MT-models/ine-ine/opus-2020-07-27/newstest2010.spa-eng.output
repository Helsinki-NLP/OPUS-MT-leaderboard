The Chairman and Barack Obama will come to Oslo, Norway to pass 26 hours and receive the Nobel Prize of the Peace, such as the fourth president of the history.
The diploma, medalla and the check of 1.4 million dollars will, inter alia, receive them by the progressive efforts to strengthen the global diplomacy and cooperation between the nations.
The chief of the White House and his wife Michelle will come to Norwegian metropolis morning and will have much to do.
First, visit the Nobel Institute, where for the first time the five members of the committee who chose between 172 persons and 33 organizations in October.
Then, the presidential couple has planned a position with the king of Norway, Harald V, and the Queen of Sonia.
On the afternoon the visit will cool with a ceremonie where Obama will receive the prestigious galardon.
He will be the fourth Chairman and will receive it, even though the third who receives it in his responsibility.
The White House has already announced that when receiving the prize, he will talk about the Afghanistan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that it is being received the premium as a president of a country currently in war in two countries.
His war efforts increased even more with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not mean to mention any of its critics.
In the ceremonie, Obama will also receive the gold medallale, the diploma and the check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable parafines, but it has not yet decided to which organization in particular.
The President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which they will accuse, as well as the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and the other 250 invited.
Obama from the beginning had a better reserved to the premium.
He mentioned, for example, the feeling that he did not deserve it.
He also repeated several times that the premium is not only for him, but for all who fight for the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he mentioned that "a challenge to take action".

It is now arrested and held up to three years of prison.
Brno doesn't like the containers to separate the waste
In Prague, citizens can separate drink packagings and in the southern villages of Moravia can be found containers to separate the bathroom everywhere.
What about Brno?
There they need a few minutes to find their containers.
I don't want to do that in Brno.
I think, to be the second largest city of the Republic, assemblies are not interested enough for this problem.
Brno is completely delayed in the division of bathrooms, not only because we, citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but especially by the number of containers for those residues.
Have you ever tried, for example, to put a PET bottle in the centre to the appropriate container?
It's almost impossible, especially re held a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found until now is on the Moõské place, of la Poëená Huse.
Let Mr. Underka and your companions not be hungry with me, but that seems too little.
It is not necessary to mention that in other parts it is also not easy to separate the washing.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
By Vagance
What happens is that the containers are far away.
Don't surprise me.
I offered myself, after a party, to take a number of glass and plastic bottles into the basket.
But in the Kaunicova Hall I saw no red container nearby.
Fortunately, going to the travel, I found the right place.
However, the washing was already exhausted from the container.
It's still the centre of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?
What's happening is that the technology and the estate doesn't seem too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the extraligate hockey to the city, which has a lot of us throughout the Republic, and do not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is more.
I'm glad that I can compare my hypothesis, after navigating on the Internet a little bit, with official statistics.
If the EKO-KOM society is, Brno is the worst of all the region of Jihomo's country.
The "Paroubek" budget removed money from income and illness subsidies
After the left side, despite the Government's opinion, added funds for agricultors or officers, there may be no enough money in the budget for rents, disease subsidies or for building.
But not for the interests of the state debt or international debts.
This will damage all those governing in the second half of the next year, says the Minister of Hacienda Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for some groups, the Government was convinced that the Government would posterously request a loan for sensitive, rental or subsidies of disease. "This is only to address the problems for the future, it is to put mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when money is taken, interests must be paid increasingly higher and, one day, money must be acquired.
The State has no many options to get money.
If the State's social subsidies or costs are not reduced, taxes must be increased.
All who have added to the left now: bombers, teachers, farmers.
And later, too, your children.
People don't have to be concerned about income or subsidies of illness, they will receive them; from these accounts, 1.800 million have disappeared.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; the next year will not miss only 163,000 million but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase with interest costs.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer reach with easily increased VAT or reduced maternity subsidies, as did the government in its deficit package.
As a result of the allocation of money in favour of some groups of electors, the next year will also miss five billion billion to finish the construction of roads and railways.
It is particularly the sectors in which the invitation has already been held and where the construction process has already started, whose projects cannot be changed and whose price can also be reduced.
The maximum you can do is keep them, which is not even free.
This means delay or cease of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warn the carrier of the Karel Hanzelka Transport Minister.
The CSSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the CEZ dividends, which is greater property of the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividing is never safe or is an unfunded sack.
The last year of the CHEZ was 18,000 million.
Each year of dividends are liquidated by ecological damage, they serve to complete the account for rents or serve as a reservation for prepared rent reform.
Furthermore, with this truck, EU rules, the actual budget deficit increased by 5.7% of the BDP.
The carnaval of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to grant a number of compensations to the victims of communism and crime, or for the expenditure of deficits, including in the construction.
It is not clear whether the State will need those funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international dispute, maybe we'll have to pay it, Janota.
The Minister will then have to cover money within the resort or, in the worst of the cases, with the reserve of the government's budget.
It is also missing hundred million for the State Pokladna (State Caja), whose price is two billion and which has already been started.
The first step begins in January.
If the Coach Minister doesn't find the money on another side, the project will have to be stopped and there will be sanctions, he advises Janota.
Your future smart phone can work with two operating systems
They will count with a mobile phone where the user can, by pressing a key, change between several operating systems.
Reveled plans are promised.
Only pressing one key, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Exactly this option is the objective of the company and VMware, which is focused especially on the development of the computer software.
In your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate simultaneously, indicated Srinivas Krishnamurti from the VMware company at the interview for the Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of the last year, and several days ago it was shown for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
Intelligent phone analysis is no more fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated journalists how the smartphone works with two operational systems.
It was Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the systems are working at the same time, Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in their pooge.
The VMware company will cooperate with European operators and and ́s to test smartphone installation tests and these phones will come to customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains care for hotels
Not only telescope holders in Krkonoche are concerned about the tracks without snow.
The lack of snow makes people don't reserve cheap stations in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonosche, rooms for all winter dates are still available, including for Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but she still fears to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask our opinion, whether these Christmas will have snow or bar," said the maintenance of the computer portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to pass in Spindlerov Mlýn a Nochevie seem to be expected, should no longer doubt on reservation of the stay.
Those who prefer to cover the money and put the accommodation quality secondly can try to wait for a few more days.
Hotels of Špindlerov Mlýn offer overall weekly stations for Nochevieja.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will cede and offer shorter stations.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, he estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabi travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all the winter dates.
Now what's more interested in us is the Christmas week, which is still not complete.
The half of the offered places is still free.
That's why we have already prepared some Christmas stations for the last time," said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi Travel Agency can still offer the Nightway in Krkonosche, but there are less free places.
The first fourteen days of February are also selling well, the rest of winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stations is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoche.
People's waiting to see if there's snow.
No one wants to pass the end of the year in the mountain without snow.
If the tracks remain snow during the week, Christmas dates will also be overcome," she advises Schiefert.
Instead, it is a little easier to occupy rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Snežkou; the last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free places.
The interest increases during the Poland vacations in January and February, too, is selling well," reported the best hotel director in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighteen percent of the stations in Nochevieja are already busy at Omnia hotel, near the central parking in Janské Láznie.
Instead, the half of the beds is still free at the latest hotel of Janské Lázné in Christmas.
This January was a great surprise for us, since we found approximately 60% of the employment capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as the snow falls, the interest in stations in Krkonoche will certainly increase, mentioned by Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia Hotel.
However, now it seems that Krkonoche's hotels will pass the snow winds waiting.
Thursday, temperatures must fall and, if there are preciptates, in the mountains should be impossible.
But after the temperatures will rise again, Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové informed about the Hydrotheorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
US: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
It is comic that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the most intelligent man, repeat the strategy of his predecessor, which he himself took for the most stupid.
When he finally discovered his Afghanistan approach, expected to be anxious, it was shown that it was a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is used several times the wording "igual as in Iraq", but also wasn't vacilled to use the title of the Bush declaration of January 2007 for its own statement: "A new way towardsward".
It was he who criticized Bush's idea three years ago to send new military refuses to Iraq, the country suffering by civil war, and that criticized it as "unresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so there is no talk about Iraq today in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however, objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than he was able to wait.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the milagro to be repeated.
The captains of the field again asked him to increase the military quota, especially the commander of the General Afghanistan Operation Stanley McCristal. He, even despite the traditional subordinated relations, submitted to the individual fusilers in the White House to a hard critical.
He asked 40,000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president was washed for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he deceived the general over 10,000 military.
It has been achieved that Europe would promise you another 5.000, although he himself was already counting at at least 10,000.
The most difficult of the entire Obama strategy seems to be its goal, starting to return to Afghanistan's troops in 18 months and finish this procedure in three years. All Obama's teaching generated more questions from the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase is the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fractured wars in recent years, Iraq's society is well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is impossible to trust anyone and no agreement is fulfilled.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare for the Afghanistan security forces, if they are used to change the head every day if they need.
Political institutions, although formally established, will continue to be only a people of Potemkin and after it will remain the patriarchal tribes.
Equilibration of the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated because of confusional relations, even more complicated by Pakistan and Iranian influences.
Not if it is to establish a state that is "actionable", a minimum objective of all the operation, it seems to be very real.
The time of Obama's strategy shakes for its voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate, and now it is going to spread.
Only a romantic soul, who doesn't know anything about the reality, can believe that the soldiers sent to war to "come quickly home" will do some thousands here.
From the political point of view, fixing the date of the receipt of the troops is pure irresponsibility, since the Talibans will consider it as an indirect declaration of hurt and hurt.
The latest summary of the NATO showed that the Europeans are always less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians don't know, and they do not want to explain to their electors what the security of Germany or Italy has with the war with Hindu Kush has.
The other factor, which is able radically to affect the situation, is the development of the progress in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the United States will have to take a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to find the answers precisely when, if Obama is, America starts the triunphal retirement of the Afghanistan troops.
Each solution, however, will mean a dramatic reverse for the Afghanistan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is that three years are missing for the presidential elections and therefore there is a long time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs' guides will not receive the bonuses again
High executives of the Goldman Sachs will not receive the bonuses in effect this year.
It was announced to re-evaluate the hard criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 high guidelines shall receive, instead of money, actions that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
Furthermore, action may be revoked in case they had assumed severe risks.
It is held by the Regis Agency, Goldman Sachs has thus become the leader in the efforts to join the bonuses in Wall Street with the long-term power.
I guess that Wall Street is fully conscious of the longest way that he should undertake, he mentioned the former investor of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in details, added.
Goldman Sachs's criticism has been following almost $17,000 (approximately $300,000 CZK) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in this year is likely over 20,000 million dollars, despite the currently announced measure.
The high bonuses in the sector were, with the arrival of the financial crisis, delicted in the policy.
Great Britain announced on Wednesday that he planned to record once, with a tax of a fifty per cent, the bonuses for ́s bounties exceeding the 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prices in all less Physical categories
Five women, which is a record number, received today in Stockholm from King Carlos XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prices of this year, in specialized and in-specific categories.
Besides the four centimeters, he also figured among the premises a German writer of Roman origin, Herta Mıer.
The Nobel Medicine Premium received two biologists and responses, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his companion Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel in chemical received it by the Israelite Ada Jonath and the Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz by the explanation of the ≥ and function of the ribosomes.
The latest delivered premium, the Nobel Price of Economics, was received by ELIOR Ostrom and his companion Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a premised woman, was Physics.
This premium has been received today by the scientists Charles Kao for research in the area of optical cables, and George ́ith with Willard Boyle by the inventing of the CCD chip, which constitutes the basis for all digital, faxs or telescopes.
Each premium collected the diploma, Nobel's medal and the money certificate received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
In the case of a number of premiums in each categorie, the premium is divided between themselves.
The most traditionally expected Nobel, the peacemaker, received it today in Oslo, Norway, president and Barack Obama.
In its speech, he recognized the contradiction that he had been premised, since it is at the beginning of his career and also at the head of a country participating in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In order to defend its policy, however, he added that wars in certain cases are inconscient to achieve peace, although their price is high.
Minister Janota considers the dimission. Klaus invited him to Castillo
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning to the Minister of Conduct Eduard Janota, which is planting its residence in the Government, because it is not in accordance with the version of the state budget for the next year, approved by the Chamber of Members on Wednesday.
The budget and may also Janota's residence in the office will be the subjects of its Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
If he is, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public funds.
He informed the portfolio of President Radim Ochvat on the meeting.
On his stay in the function, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
The Law on the budget prepared to be signed by Klaus should be governed by the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163.000 million crowns.
The Chamber of Members, however, adopted on Wednesday the proposals from the left to the transfers of funds and increased money for officers, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government is not in accordance with the proposals of the social democrats, since in general they increase budget deficit.
A serious conflict of internal policies has occurred between the left and the Government and Klaus, and the de the other, and because of this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's office, which was agreed in primavery by the ODS, the CSSD and the Green Party.
Criticals are that the budget, in the version approved by the Parliamentary Chamber, actually liquidates the package of horrible measures imposed by the Government of Fischer to deal with public debt.
Klaus may, but he does not have to sign the law on the state budget; he stated today during a breakfast with businessmen that the politicians had long been taking on this "the serious problem", namely "the non-sustainable deficit" of the public.
It is he who today has no good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported in a larger consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the President considers.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is awesome and that the government should think about its future existence.
The President of ODS, Petr Netemp, said to ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic office with the support of CHSSD, ODS and the Green are obviously not working anymore.
Prime Minister Fischer repeated and qualified similar words of "fortunes".
The Chief of CHSSD, Jiří Paroubek, replied to Topolánek, saying that the deficit of the budget is awesome, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will overcome the 200,000 million crowns.
On Wednesday, CSSD said that the approval of the state budget for the next year was successful.
The populars were also happy.
Mandela in the new movie of Clint Eastwood, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans have that the new film of Hollywood, Invictus: Invisible, reports much about the country, its fight and its victories, although some critics say that the protagonist roles play them in American actors.
The story is talking about sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The inconscient fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and his first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in its biography by the actor and winner of a Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91 years old, asked him to interpret her in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year actor, who received the premium for his role in the drama of Eastwood on the world of the boxion Million _ Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement by the abolition of slavery, which ended being slave, of the billion president of the United States, and even of God in Evan the Almighty. But rarely represented someone who still lives and, for many, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statist spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end the apartheid in the South African Republic.
It was released in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Prize of Peace.
Invictus - Invencible is a Latin word and the title of a poema of the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pinaire, to help join the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racial and economically divided.
He thinks he is able to join his people to the deport, and therefore he is determined to join the rugby players, who belong to the outsides worldwide.
The South African team reached the World Copa in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years so Mandela's history would come to the Chinese.
He had no other purpose to play this role in such a way that it was as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, they would have meet with Mandela, dinner with him, be among bastiers before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to have the hand to Mandela.
I discovered that when I was taking your hand, I received your energy, it was transmitted and had the sense of knowing how you feel, said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pinaire, the captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players were predominant.
The actor said he had had six months to prepare for a role in the hard backby world.
A great surprise for him was when he finally met with Piner for the first time in his house.
I remember calling the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pinaire in my life was: "I look much higher in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of Director Eastwood, Invictus: Invisible received positive comments and also spoke of ambitions for Oscar.
The Daily Variety Todd McCarthy film critical summarized its evaluation with these words: "It was a very good story, a very good film."
In film records on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received a 76 percent of positive evaluations.
The secret of the spreading over Norway Solved: the Russians made evidence of a missile
On Norway, a special effect of unknown origin was observed.
The Russian Defence Minister ended recognizing yesterday that near Norway borders had proved of a ballistic intercontinental missile.
The missile, of type "Bulava", previously intended to be the proud of the Russian army, becomes the weight of the Russian Generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Unless it repeatedly presents the tests of the missile, it has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly or a mistake in the air occurred.
In the Russian magazines they write "Bulava" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that's not flying, but it's.
This, the 13th test, has not occurred at the beginning any problem.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred in the device.
Trying the engine was fixed at the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which flotted in the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the raising from a ship that is moved and is summarized at the same time.
It is therefore that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failing "Bulavá".
The Norwegians since the first time did not disappoint that it was a Russian missile.
Generals this time are defensed by saying that you can't just talk about a failure.
The first two steps of the missile endured, and the middle had occurred in the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately reported in the first stage.
Although no of the transactions had passed completely without errors, only six of the 13 were failed.
The success of almost fifty per cent full of optimism to the generals and therefore continue that "Bulava" will fly without problems on one day and that will even be able to bring up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, with a maximum weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The Legendary Fetisov signed at 51 years a annual contract with Moscow CSKA
The Legendary Viacheslav Fetisov will be presented again at 51 years of a professional hokey meeting.
The former world campaign, olympical campaign and winner of the Stanley Copa will help his CSKA Moscuu team and may be playing on Friday in the KHL's complaint against San Petersburg.
Fetisov completed his professional career at the age of 40 years in 1998 and currently presided by the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash has been wounded, we urgently need another defendant.
Fetisov practices constantly and has been committed to help the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, quoted the AP agency to Sergei Nemchinov, the trainer of the Moscu club.
It is still not clear whether the return of the player will refer to one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the courage of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
It is AP if Fetisov returns to ice tracks, it will become the longest professional player of the Russian hokey.
The legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty and one, during the whole season, and achieved 15 goles and 26 assistants.
The largest group of the five famous Fetisov players, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hokey players in the history.
By playing by the Soviet Union, he won two olympical hours, seven world campaigns, triunphed in the Canadian Copa and in the Young World Campeonate.
In the second part of his career, he also succeeded in NHL: playing with Detroit wined the Coppa Stanley two times.
Since 2001, he is a member of the Hockey Gloria Room.
Hyundai fulfilled the requirements of the syndicates. He will cancel all the additional work
The address of the car factory in Nošo agreed with the universities to cancel all additional work.
Exactly by the frequent additional work, the syndicates declared on Monday the occurrence of the hole.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vanek, the portfolio of the Hyundai car factory.
The address, however, wants to agree with the syndicates for this year a more Saturday turn.
We can't resign our manufacturing plan, since it is essential. Therefore we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday 19 December, which is, it will work in two turns, said Vanek.
Sedmička.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who work on the Sabbath tour.
The bonus will also be paid for the last Saturday, November 28.
See Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employers can cover the bonus for more hours or take a free day on December 28, for example, prolonging the Navy Festivals on one day, mentioned in Vanek.
Furthermore, all employees from the Sabbath tour will receive money for the journey and food.
Since the additional work was the most urgent and difficult point of comments and complaints of the syndicalists and Holguists, which stopped the production last week, the address last afternoon decided immediately to cancel all the additional work for December, Vanek mentioned.
The employees of the car factory have seen due to work two hours more than eight hours, and this situation has lost almost every day until the last week.
After signing the agreement, the syndicates will cancel the outcome.
Another negotiation between the manufacture and the syndicalists should be carried out on Monday morning.
The Chief of the Syndicates Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday, that if they engaged in compliance with the requirements and signed the document, they are ready to cancel the occurrence by throat.
The situation in the car factory was increasing last week, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously entered into wedding for the frequent additional jobs.
They also protested against the bad conditions of payment and the assumption of accusation.
The direction thought that employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and to provide cars.
Syndicalists in their statement of the emergency on Monday also said that none of the employees, who interrupted the production last Wednesday, had been punished in any way.
As regards the additional work, syndicates require the company to reduce it at least.
Moreover, this year re­new for this work a reward of 5.000 crowns.
The car factory in NochoHyundai has currently 2.000 employees.
Serial production was started last November.
By the past September, it produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the HIV's 'scale' virus
The Science Team of Czech and German tests of new compositions of moderate HIV spread in the body
The main benefit of this improved substance is that it is effective too against drug resistant virus.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the composition is not so effective in a common virus variant, as some medicinal products already.
AIDS disease can not be cured until now.
However, the life of patients may be significantly prolonged by a mixing of medicines that imped HIV replication in the body.
However, its use has many secondary effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely deleted, the called resistance virus will be created; against them, the medicines are no longer working.
The work of the experts of three Institutes of the Czech Republic of Scientifics, VŠCHT Prague and the Heidelberg University shows the possibility of dominating the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that metal carbon substances have effect on the albumin, responsible for the propagation of HIV virus.
Metacarbons are compositions of bovine, ≥ogeneous, carbon and cobalt.
These composities block the propagation of virus in a different way than all medicines used today, and therefore the problem of resistance can be solved.
In their work, scientists find new, "better" compositions, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the albumine of the virus.
Metacarbons have one three-dimensional: two polyhedron powders composed of bore, ®ogene and carbon atom are united by metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus
HIV protease is a HIV-virus albumin, and it is impossible for the vital virus cycle.
Without HIV proteasis, HIV virus fraction is not produced and no mature and infectious virus corporations would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists explain in a press news published by the Organic and Biochemical Institute in the Czech Republic Scientific AGEA.
In a article published in the Scientific Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compositions, where two pairs of bottles (see table) are united by a short organic series, which is still systematicly modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was performed in probete, and also against their resistent variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metal carbons on the common enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, but do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which medicinal products often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, other qualities such as bio- and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes makes it, that metal carbons are interesting composites for research with the aim of offering effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlína Reezáčová, the leader of biological biologic and biochemical chemical Institute and the Institute of Molecular Genetics in the Scientific Academy.
ODS attacked Fischer, he defended himself.
ODS Chief Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the next year is "wonderful" and the Government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, if he is, think about his future existence.
The ODS statements were signed by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say it's left time for analysis.
The President of ODS Petr Netemp said that the concept of the bureaucratic office with the support of CHSSD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously not working anymore.
See In time the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the House of Members he wants to be supported in the minority, which is to fight the growing deficit, or if he wants to remain in his position with the aid of the parliamentary left.
The ODS and social democracy towards the problem of public deficit are fully different, advertised Intime.
The House of Members yesterday adopted the budget for 2010, however, with the amendment proposals on the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Members increased money for public officers, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government rejected the proposals of ODS, since the budget deficit is strictly increased.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote went out of the hall and thus fulfilled the Government's desire, that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusion and uselessness
The Ministry of Hacienda, Eduard Janota, spoke of disillusion and feeling of inutileness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government would again appreciate the current situation.
In time, it is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten the discharge in case of approval of the amendments, the situation could have been different.
The Czech television Janota asked for a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He signaled that he's thinking about staying in the function.
The reason is its disappointment for the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, it is Netime in the Government, they have nothing to do with the nominated by the CSSD, which has made changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say, if the camera adopts other laws that increase deficit, such as subventions in disease, rents, or amendment of service law.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS have no fault
It is the subject of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The Ministers appointed by the ODS did not do anything bad, underlined Topolánek in the US text news.
He recalled that there are people who belong to TOP 09 in several ministerial offices, who voted against the budget.
In time, he stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the fight against the deficit of the public deficit, "is absolutely logical and correct, which is supported by the majority of the isisdist, which is currently in the Camera of Members."
However, it cannot account for the support and tolerance of ODS members.
I didn't think about it, when it is time, I would take care of it, and he told the journalists in the Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed for the Government exactly by the members of the ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a European Council at Brussels afternoon.
ODS sent to the Premier Minister's request
In time, the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister did not directly ask the ODS members to allow the adoption of the budget.
We don't feel like poor, we're not small children, he repeatedly asked whether ODS does not care about the absence of the head of the party in Parliament and the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
He didn't realize that my vote was missing.
When the mandate was released, he knew that in the following months it was particularly involved in the bulchevisation of the members' camera and the destruction of all the positive things, Topolánek repeatedly.
The new train time of CD will be less trains for almost the same tariffs
Czech drahy (Czech Ferrocarriles) will cancel or restrict some less used rapid and local trains and will strengthen some links.
The total traffic performance will be reduced to two percent compared to today, after the new train time comes into force.
Most tariffs include the basic and customer price will not change.
More opportunities to link capital will, for example, win the residents of the Ostravsko region, drahy for this line will add a pendolino carretera.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not go back to Bratislava.
In the Praga line - Písek - České Bu日o will be less fast trains, the direct links of Praga - Letohrad will be limited.
In the regions, the largest reduction in the transport planned by drahy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, in contrast, the transport will increase in Prague and the surroundings.
Two night trains will also be cancelled in the Track of Praga - Tabor - České Bu日 and some quick trains on the Praga - Písek - České Bu · it will be reduced only to a few days of week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line of Milo to Prague, the inhabitants of Milo have to change to Lysá na Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esco system, in the surroundings of the cities, its opening is possible through the electrication of the Lysá na Labem line to Milo.
Long distance links to capital will end at the Praga Hla nadraž station.
ChD will introduce more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Shumperk/Jesenic will be held every two hours.
From 13 December, the travelers will not return to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The account for the regional railways of this year: 200 million more than before
The rapid trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the demonstrable loss calls of Dráhy will receive the year coming four billion crowns totally, like this year. The local trains are charged by the regions, the next year will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more decent.
For fast trains and local drahy, they have a new ten-year contract, until now the contract was always for a year.
Drahy is happy with the system, and maybe so they have not increased the prices of a large majority of the billets.
Changes will be made only in a day's billets - CHD Net and eLiška's e-mail billets.
For travelers without customer cards, the CHD Net price will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, until now there was the only price of 160 crowns for travel between two regional cities.
Philippines are still arresting more than 50 people, children were released
Armed people have seized 75 people in the south of Philippines today, among them a number of students of a primary school and their teachers.
The AFP Agency, which previously informed only about 65 sequestrates.
All 17 children were arrested and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The sequest occurred in the South Augustan province.
They say approximately 19 weapons use rehens as a living scroll in the flight from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of residues.
The AFP Agency belongs to the New Popular Army (NPA), a weaponsed fraction of the Communist Party of Philippines (CPP).
The AP agency had previously persecuted the sequencers due to violence, which was the adjustment of the accounts between two classs of local families.
In the south of Philippines in the Maguindanao province, it was due to the recent murder, in which 57 people died, imposed the martial law.
Among the victims of killing on 23 November, with the elections of the Governor, were 30 journalists.
For the suspicion of the implication in murder, they arrested the governor of this province in the south of Philippines and their father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of a influent dynasty of the Ampatuanians.
On the Mindanao Island, the Muslim separatists also operate.
However, on Tuesday, they renewed peace dialogues with the Philippine government.
The RSA story refers to all the world, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next days, a new film of Hollywood, Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech is Invictus: Neporaženy), which takes part of the biography of the former president of South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the worldwide fighter against the apartheid plays Morgan Freeman, whom he has chosen for the protagonist role of the Mandela.
The second role, the legendary campaign in rugby Francoise Pinaire, interpreted it by Matt Damon.
Externally they are born of the reactions of critics and publics
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Saharov Price for the freedom of thinking, in 1993 he received, with Klerk, the Nobel Prize of Peace.
He was the President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great hopes, since it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa are prepared for the world's football campaign. At the same time, the media are embarrassed by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
The AP news agency, reactions to this new movie in RSA have been positive, despite a number of reservations against the distribution of protagonist papers by Hollywood's "small interesting" stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new movie.
For many years, I dreamed with the paper and prepared me well to perform it.
Many times I found me in person with Nelson Mandela, for - as it is said - to cover his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festival of the festival in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if we can remember the personage and message of Mandela at the movie.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to all the world, he added.
At the carrying of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book of the British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game, the nation was born. It refers to the South African lawyer of human rights during his first electoral presidential period.
Morgan Freeman at the movie is trying to join two groups of residents, racially and for a long time separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as a protagonist is also putting the tragedy of the National South African team of rugby and entering the game field.
By entering the grass in the tragedy, which is considered in RSA as something almost sacred, Mandela won great ovations for 14 years, especially the white public and the recognition of white people.
The football campaign may be able to help people join and form a nation, mentioned the rubbby Chester Williams, the only "black" player in the national team in 1995.
You will still see if you improve the stress situation in the RSA.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptics, as he said in a recent interview for LN, a rubby Christopher Dawson, who fled from his country to Britain.
The campaign begins on 11 June 2010.
Lounsko burns a transformer with a value of millions of crowns
The incendie has reached the morning a Transformer of the Cheps company in a box of interruptor near the village Výskov in Lounsko.
It is Lukas Marvan, the carrier of the Usti region bombers, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously, the bombers wanted to allow the transformer to be destroyed by the fire, but later they changed their opinion and the fire was extinguishing it with a mixture of water, smoke and a special extinctor.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the cortocycle of the transformator.
There were no wounds, it was Pavla Mandátová, the company's voice, the relief does not threaten the security function of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is of a number of million crowns, it will not be possible exactly before the fire is exhausted.
See Mandátová will need to replace the transformer destroyed by a new.
The ten years of Cheps' activity did not happen anything similar, this type's beauty are sprayable, added.
See Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the vote of the CEZ society for the North Czech Republic, the suppliers of the river were not cut down, and the fuel of the substation does not affect the functioning of households, offices or companies.
A.s. Cheps acted in the territory of the Czech Republic as the maintenance of the distribution system, of the carrier of 400 kV and 220 kV.
Keep in good state, renew and develop 39 boxes of interruptor with 67 transformators, which carry energy from the transmission system to the distributor system, also maintain the carrier of 4339 km long.
Janchura will present a complaint for a triple trip of ChSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will present today a complaint for a calumniation to three social democracy hits.
It is Michal Hašek de la region Jihomo’s country, Radko Martínek de Pardubisk country and el hetman de Olomoucky country Martin Tesařík.
Janchura mentioned it in 20 minutes in Radiojournal.
The request must be regarded by the company's efforts, maintaining regional railway transport in some regions.
However, all regions ended by signing long-term contracts with Tscheské drahy.
All three hits are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the steps of the pastel", but we only offered the offer for what they wanted.
Afirman, that we are more dear than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of České drahy, which were fixed last week.
So we don't have anything to defend us.
It's because of the calamity to the Student Agency company, he said to Radiojurnal Jančura.
He mentioned at the same time the evidence of all regions, which has not taken necessary measures in accordance with European law.
That is why it is preparing an invoice for the European Commission.
Hashek considers this claim for the continuation of Mr. Jančura's average show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course, I am ready to defend my good reputation and that of my region, and I call on the others who do it too.
I guess that at this occasion, too, it will be clearly demonstrated that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the field of regional railway transport, and uses false and arguments, Hashek mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that would invest several million crowns in publicity, whose goal would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiojurnal told her that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue after the new Year.
He needed that the campaign would be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional railway links and, for the responsibility of approximately 150 billion crowns, they did not convocate a tender.
See Jančura similar steps are in line with the European Court's opinion.
Janchura has been threatened by a member of the CSSD due to its criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we don't leave it, we'll be able to hold bus licences.
It was presented as a member of the CSSD, I know, what Mrs is it, I won't say his name, said Jančura to Radiojurnal today.
Neumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
Neumococal vaccine will end the customs since January.
As the first vaccine must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, opinions have already occurred, that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against neumococos culminate.
The Institute of Medicinal Products is already fixing the maximum prices of vaccines, which are entrusted by insurance companies.
Experts have also made it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January, children born from 2 August of the last year may receive freely the neumococal vaccine.
It is not having received a dose from the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before must also cover other vaccine doses.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and the fifth month of age.
Last year, the fourth part of the families allowed their children to vaccine their children against neumococs.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
In general, experts estimate that insurance companies will cost in vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually.
Without embrace, they will be stuck in the treatment, which is needed for unvacuated children.
Until now, the state has expelled all children's vaccination about 500 thousand per year.
The vaccination was started by Janota's named package.
Neumococo is the cause of medium otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Nemolocale infections in our country die each year are investigations in hospitals 28 children not less than 10 years of age.
Furthermore, in Czech Republic, the neumococal vaccine was introduced to children in approximately 40 countries.
Is the vaccine mandatory?
However, at the same time there are opinions that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January, it must be held by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovský, the leader of the Civil Association of Nahlas.
Its association has propagated neumococcal vaccines since a long time.
Experts at a international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way we now have to undertake, mentioned Kalovsky.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against neococos.
At this point we don't think of it absolutely, said his portfolio Vlastimil Srszeň.
The voluntary vaccine has its disappointments, doctors
The Presidenta de la societat de pediatras Professional Company of Practical Child Medicines Hana Cabrnoch admits that la vaccine voluntarian has su desventajas.
If all children would receive the vaccine, it could be reasoned for the reduction of the dose number. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand the political decision that the vaccination has started as a voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that from the year coming more than 80 percent of young parents let their children vaccine against neumococos.
Neumococal vaccine is also a big change because as the first vaccination in children is inherited by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should cost more money in the profilaxis, to stop the treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
The doctors will have to buy vaccines for themselves.
However, the pediatres are concerned about the purchasing of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as the state gives other vaccines.
Some Members, however, feared that insurance companies could "taking the money from health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that the pediatres will invest in the vaccines 40,000 per month, which is a notable amount.
It'll be nothing easy, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an artist and involved "in the steal of a museum"
The son of the renamed northern American artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused to try to steal rated pintures in $20 million and $12 million from his father's museum.
The police of Pensilvania that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while he loaded 90 tables in his vehicle and his relocation.
Afirman that Frazetta and another man used an excava to irromp in the museum, in the region of the Mountains Pocon.
Frazetta father, 81 years old, is aware of his representation of characters such as Conan the Barbaro and Tarzán.
The News Agency has informed that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer suggested that a family dispute could have motivated young Frazetta.
The Agency informed that Frazatta, 52-year-old son, declared to the police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to transfer all tables to a deposit".
The Agency said that Frazetta father refused to have granted such permission.
The employee party defenses the increases in tax in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and expenditure in the pre-budget report, with the criticism of opposition, undertakings and syndicates.
The Conservators said that Alistair Darling "loss" had a chance to show its seriousness on the deficit's degree, delaying the decisions until after the elections.
The Deputy Minister also received hard criticisms for harming low and medium-income workers.
Among its main proposals, the expenditure of social security is decreased by 0.5% and a top of 1% in the public salary agreements since 2011.
Coal for Social Security
Syndicates have complained that low salaries workers are punished with a recession generated by others, and they have warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security expenditure, which will increase about three billion pounds per year, has enraged the business community, which is a tax for employment, when the focus should be in economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those wining more than 200,000 pounds per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
CLASSIFICATION OF THE FIRST INFORMATION OF THE PRODUCT
Social security with an additional increase of 0.5 % from April 2011
Economy will be more than expected than 4.75% this year
New tax of 50 % on bankers' goods
The 1 point of the tax on companies for small signatures has been rejected
Tax decreases for cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
A person wins £30,000 £90 per year and wins £40,000 £190, while a person wins £10,000 per year will win £110.
The Ministers said that their objective to reduce the deficit to half for 2013 was "faithful decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be over 5% of the highest salaries.
The Ministry of Hacienda, Stephen Timms, refused that tax expenditures and delineated expenditures were a " sand grain in the wilderness" compared to what was needed.
"These are large numbers. It will allow us to reduce deficit to half, which is absolutely essential during the next four years," he said to the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he trusted that the economy would grow again to the end of the year.
However, the prognoses of the labour party regarding the future economic growth, which will affect the quantity of demand and the rapid reduction of deficit, have been doubted after the Minister of Affairs has seen obligated to change the first numbers.
In its statement, he suggested that the economy would probably be at 4.75% this year, far worse than the decrease of 3.5% pronostic in April, while the demand for loans would be £3 billion over the estimated estimated.
"Unperformed opportunity"
The Conservators, who will launch a new public campaign on Thursday, warning about "the debt crisis" of the work party, said that the projection of loans for $789 billion for the next six years was insufficient.
The Ministers had failed to present a reliable plan on how they would make money, added, "cinically" the difficult options until the elections to be made in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," the Minister said in the shadow of the Ministry of Aviation, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it and they disappointed it."
"All important announcements will be made after elections, win who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Working Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police of future coverages will be protected, in contrast with the proposals of conservas, which would seek a greater deficit reduction to a shorter period.
However, the democratic liberals have made that the money recovered by tax increases and cost recovery would be used to support the costs of the next year, not to reduce deficit, arguing that the projects were "casts of sand".
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that the time chosen for announcements, such as the increase in inflation of certain subsidies by incapacity of the next month of April, mentioned earlier, would leave the Minister of Affairs exposed to electoral manual accusations, since the money could simply be recovered next year.
However, the workshop insists that the most needed people are being provided and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"President"
Although the ministers did not publish expenditure data after 2011, the economy said that it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be made for a middle-term.
The respected Fiscal Study Institute said that the numbers of the Ministry of Affairs included substantive coverages in many areas, including transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"This is actually appealing the pain forward," said your director, Robert Chote.
"All important announcements will come after the election, win whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser of Deloitte counters.
"This has been the previous report before the budget. The markets are accounted of this."
The FBI investigates the "detentions of and detentions in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention of five men and suspicious of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The Pacific ambassador told the BBC that the men were arrested in a house in Sarghoda, in the east provincy of Punjab.
The FBI said he was investigating if they were the same men who disappeared from his homes in Virginia, USA, last month.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United States said that he was also looking for information about men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistanian descendants, one of Egypt's inheritance and the other of Jemen's origin.
"If they are North American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and in what kind of circumstances they are holding," said the portfolio Ian Kelly.
The FBI portfolio, Katherine Schweit, said that the agency was in the knowledge of arrests and was in contact with the families of disappeared students.
"We are working with the Pakistan authorities to determine their identities and nature of their business there, if these are actually the students who were disappeared," said the portfolio.
The Pakistanian Embajada said that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said that the house was already in the view of the local police and that there were no charges against prisoners yet.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hillary Clinton, refused to make comments on detentions, informed the news Agency Re. But he said that the U.S. had to "work closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to reclut and train people".
The families of the five students announced their disaster in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
International Amnisty condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran have always been equal to deficiencies during the last 20 years, a report of the International Amnisty Campaign Group.
The report describes "the models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
A man cited in the report said they had hit him and burned him with cigarettes, and another said that they threatened him to violate him.
Iran has raised criticisms of his history of human rights.
The officers have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of persons arrested and twelve murdered in Iran after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad caused greater road protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Twelve persons have been condemned, and tax officers say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The representative of the BBC in Teheran, Jon Leyne, now located in London, says that during the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamenei, recognised some abuse accusations, ordering the closure of the detention centre of Kahrizak.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance to criticism, if our responsible.
False confession
Amnistia International cited the report of Abraham Mehtari, a 26-year-old informatic student, who suggested that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the result of elections.
"You often hit me in your face" is your words.
"They burned me with cigarettes below the eyes, on the neck, the head... they threatened me to execute and humiliated me."
Amnistia said that after five days, she signed a confession and left it and left the street, still bleeding and semiconscient.
In August, the broken presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some manifestants arrested after the election had been tortured until death in prison, and others had been violated.
Iranian officers rejected violation accusations, but admitted that abuses had occurred.
Amnistia also quoted the case of an ex arrest, who suggested that it was found in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnistia recognized that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authority had established committees to investigate the disease of the post election and the response of the Government, but said that the mandate and powers of the bodies were confused and the disclosure of the Parliamentary Committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent more manifestations.
A ski track was made in the city's park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to convert a Bristol interest site into a competition track.
The Pista at the park event attached 16 semiprofesional snowboarders and snowboarders who competed for real premiums.
At the top of the penetration at Brandon Hill Park, there was a short spring ramp, in front of a trace of 100 meters of length.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was very scared.
It looks below a beautiful view of the town's lights.
Here are some of the best snowboarders and snowboarders in the condate, real talent," he added.
The premiums were delivered to the best trucks or hands performed in the track.
After the event of Thursday evening, the snow will be cut off.
Still they and us
Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Laico State.
In a time when its voters have asked to prohibit the construction of minerals and that there is a generalised warning on the proposed islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, a North American Academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of the Muslims (which are actually integrating) in one of the most openly latest societys in the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirators of the last work of the author "Why the French don't like the watches" ("Why the French Don't Like Headcarves") (2006), a elegant and delicate study of a problem that divided and concerned the country during a deep and medium, and whose effects are still understood today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen has a broader and ambitionary perspective.
As a good antropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are saying about islam in France, but what is really happening.
There have been months in mexican, schools and institutions that now provide to the 5-6 million Muslims of France, which Mr. Bowen calls "islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who plays debates between teachers and students on the questions they are more interested.
Should a Muslim marry in a mixture or at a meeting (or both)?
Should young Muslims teach them about homosexual development and rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-muslim man?
Is it lawful that a Muslim uses a system based on interests to get a hypoteca?
These are apparently world-wide issues, which support, daily life things, which concern the means more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imagines, teachers and intellectuals, none of them in rename, with the possibility of Tariq Ramadán, a academic and arabic museum born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern lake society.
The argument could not be distributed completely.
Conservators doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr. Bowen interviews tend to be in agreement with Salafi's homologs, partyers of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influent presence among the Muslims of Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French laicism could be compatible.
But adaptation re-reacts mutual concessions.
Ask how far the French political strategies (and the intellectual elite that so ferozly defenses laicism) are really committed with pluralism.
It suggests that the Muslims may have a more unfair treaty than the Catholic, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments with Lac Republicanism.
More than a growing pragmaticism, he feels "a value adjustment".
Can the Islam be French? After reading this book, one intends to say, "Yes, but not yet."

Even at present, the zoological springs are still still a million of the area of a wild adult. The climate is almost never suitable: a pool coat resident in Singapore was made green by the algas that grow within the areas without hair of its pool.

Ellis recalls reports of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to the super-especies.
Although it is in Norway, the United States and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter chasers and the Motoring Indians use high-powered appeal fusils to destroy their prisons.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two jailing nations where ice will take more time.
In his new book, "After the Ice" ("After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, an ancient editor of New Scientist, provides a clear and scalofrian report on the science of the Arctic and a supercoge of how the future can be transformed in that place.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither scientists of atmosphere nor oceanographics can explain the speed of changes properly.
It's not because of lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioners at the end of the 19th century and the principles of the 20th century for the first time indicated the movement of ice mass.
Then the cold war's submarins draw a map of the ice moving corners below the ice mass.
Satellite explosions and series of songs mounted in the icebergs are a useful supplement, but refreshing individuals campaigned in the cold are still performing many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, decreased world of the flat system inside the artic ice, formed by salt water flowers that are compressed while congeling.
But from the beast on the surface to the microscopic miracles of the inside, they are all condemned once the ice of the soil goes away, what it seems to happen at some time between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marins between the 6.000 crowns in Arlington's tubes
Pfc. De'Angelo Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours in bus to put one crown on the tube of a soldier who had never known.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cementary to decorate tubes, it was a day to deal with men and women who once stood in their boats.
In a few months, from where they are shiping us, these could be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we are, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to put crowns in the veteran tubes in several sections of the Arlington Centery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Crowns Worcester Company in Harrington, started the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundreds of tubes in the Arlington Cementary.
In what is a 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen are traveling each year in different cities on the road to office events dedicated to military and terrorist victims.
Worcesters also found an unfinished organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the Arlington Cementary Tubes, areas in the Pentagon, tubes in the National Cementary of Fayetteville in Arkansas, the Battery Park in the town of New York and on the memorandum site by the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation gave over $150,000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, said he did the journey to Arlington in honor to her husband, a dead military career.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was her way to give a recompense to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family tube.
Heavy clothes, volunteers walked to ○ of the widespread praises and hills of the cementary.
The volunteers were guided to older tubes of the First World War, the Second World War, and the Vietnam War, because they did not receive such visits as the new tubes, they said the organizationers.
The atmosphere was joyful while the children played and the couple took their hands, while wearing the fresh pine to the sepulchral stones.
Each crown was of a deep green, with a small red lin attached on the top.
Nearly there, Section 60, where most of the veterinarians of Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, remained silent.
The United Services Organizations (Association Pro the Soldier) gave 1000 crowns to decorate the section, but the shadow atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others reaped, and families and friends supported each other in the glacial air.
Some read in a loud voice scrolled names in the stones, while others claimed to see small white and black plates placed in the mixed bar, for those whose stones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who played the tears of their eyes before her son's tube.
He spent eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the Tube of the Sgto Marine Artist. David Shane Spicer, who died in the fight in July.
No one should ever be able to see why we are free. My son paid for it, he said.
"Some after my death, I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officials arrested a Government contractor and
The Cuban Government has arrested a government contractor and has distributed mobile and computers in the country, the officers of the State Department held on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Alternative Development Inc, with a seat in Bethesda.
The company works in projects for customers such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the United States Interest Section in La Habana are looking for the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested by almost any thing that is considered "of danger".
All activities called anti-revolutionary activities, including light and critical protests, include the risk of arrest.
Anti-governmental graphs and talks are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an inciting blogger community, addressed by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, which often writes about how she and her husband are followed and attacked by government agents.
Sánchez has requested in several occasions permission to leave the country to accept premiums, but the permission has been denied.
The detention of a contractant and - may probably cause tensions between the Communist Government of Castro's brothers in Cuba and the administration of Obama, which has been looking for a "slow time" approach to improve the relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to meet the news of arrest on Friday night.
The new policy and stresses that if the Cuban Government takes concrete measures, such as freedom of political prisoners and the creation of most space for opposition, there will be reciprocity from the United States.
Mobile mobiles and computers are legal in Cuba, although they are new and cooked in a country where the average payment of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban Government granted the citizens the right to buy mobile only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, since a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily payment.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in dear hotels and for foreign visitors from the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of a e in Cuba is inu.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the United States Interest Section in La Habana, said that most of the citizens and prisoners in Cuba are among crime reactions such as drug traffic.
Berbena said she couldn't provide more information about arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly uncertain.
A activity that would be legal in any other open society, such as distributing free mobile mobile, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the United States Programme of the Human Rights Watch, which recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, itself Cuba", a reference to the location of Raul Castro as a leader of the country, to substitute his older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused are often arrested, processed and imprisoned in one day.
He showed that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just when both countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistanian functioners design a complot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistan authorities neutralized the presumptuous brain of a complot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill troops and troops, demonstrating that they hope that the case can help discontinue a network of terrorist recluters, who replace the Internet for radicalized young people.
The researchers said that they were persecuting a mysterious figure known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments accepting terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah directed the men once they were in Pakistan, helping them reach the remote area in the Pakistan tribe, which is a family place for the Qaeda and their terrorist training fields.
But a Pakistanian intellectual officer who had been informed about the case showed the Sabbath that Saifullah could not convince the commanders of the Qaeda that men were not part of a complot of the case to infiltrate into the terrorist network.
Therefore, they were isolated for several days in the east city of Sargodha, far from the imponents of the northwest mountains, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of an operating in the surface.
For this reason, the officer, who has spoken from anonymous due to the delicateness of the case, was depressed.
The officer said that men were not inmuted and were even trying to achieve the appropriate approval for the fields of the Qaeda when the Pakistan police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are interrogated by the FBI, stresses the critical role of recluders in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps, what is most important, determines who are confidential.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, intellectuality and Property has set the main priority to infiltrate people within the Qaeda.
The reclusors of the organization act as guards, not allowing those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
The analystes said that Qaeda was particularly focusing on American reclutes.
But for the organization, they represent a huge attractive, because of their potential to have access to objectives and objectives and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an older analyz for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also been much more careful in recent years for those who admit because the intellectual and responsibility agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than following the model of recruitment what many have already followed?
It has been transformed into a model based much more on the web.
Tens of thousands protesting in Copenhagen, requires a climate "action"
The Sabbath tens of thousands of manifestants went here through the streets by negotiating the negotiators working at the Center of Bella Center Conventions.
The manifestants said that 100 000 people participated in the event, but the police thought that the amount was closer to 25,000.
The event was pac. Although a couple of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
In a day when a little time in the conversations on the climate patrocinated by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the city by supporting pancarts in English saying, "No planet B" and one in Spanish he declared, "the Earth says "anything".
A number of famous people joined the protest, including the Danish and the Danish model Helena Christiansen, who said that Peru, the country of his mother's birth, made me aware of the troubled issues that the country must lead due to the impacts of climate changes already occurred. "
This is part of the reason for which I decided to join the great manifestation, to spread the word and call on the leaders of the world, to present a righteous, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not a easy task, but it is to be done, there is no way to excite it for more time.
The police prevented manifestants to get too close to Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 persons, mainly because of the use of masks or by carrying bottles.
In accordance with the Danish law, those activities are held during demonstrations.
There is a testimony, which requested not to be identified because of being involved in the climate discussions, sporting activists and black masks have placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is near several ministers.
They were by the buildings, he said, adding that they started as called, but they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the centre of conventions, people gathered around the television screens to watch the walk throughout the afternoon.
But the protest seemed not to penetrate in the consciousness of key officers such as Your Wei, China's head of climate negotiator.
When he was asked if he thought that the manifestation had a constructive impact on international debates, he answered in English, "It was not really the situation."
Then he continued to say in the mandary, "as the place of the place is great, I can't hear what happens outside."
He indicated that it depended on the perspective of each person to determine whether the walk was being injurious or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the public in general and of various sectors on the subject of climate change.
On the other hand, "that can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of others.
Test data reveal persistent racial differences
The Federal Book of Qualifications last week on Mathematical performance was a very good news for the public schools of the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the systems with a better performance of the country, the book of qualifications showed that fourth and eighth degree students have given a faster time during the last two years, regarding the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains in the recent numbers of the National Evaluation of Education Progress is the continuous difference in performance between African students and white students, both locally and at national level.
The average scores of the fourth white students of the D.C. during the last two years increased from 262 to 270 (in a scale of 500), but their African parents only increased three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Africans of eighth degree remained essentially fixed, decreasing an insignificant point statistically from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the results of the test, because the size of the sample was not sufficiently large.
During a six-year period, the table is no longer encouraged.
The difference separated from white and fourth students in 2003, when the first ENPE was known in the District, was from 60 points of the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only been reduced to 58.
Some educational lawyers in the District expressed anxiety last week, since the advances held by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Master Adrian M. Fenty (Democrate) were mostly impulsed by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the total to them at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, Jeff ́th, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that is aware of educational justice in the District.
I don't give pleasure for a difference of two or three points, said the member of the Council of the D.C., Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-For acumulation), who has a daughter at the fourth degree of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an asylum critic of Rhee's administration style, said that the message of the test scores is that the city's secondary schools have an unexpected need of attention .
They always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what concerns is that we don't dedicate neither time nor energy necessary for our average schools.
Rhee said that the District needs to continue to find better ways to deal with the needs of the students of low performance.
This is, for example, training some teachers to use a new reading course, the Wilson Reading System, directed to students of the higher levels of primary and medium-school, which did not dominate the early reading foundations in their school courses and are considered behind their parents.
Mathematics every day, a mathematical curriculum from Kindergarten to six degrees, which highlights games and experiences of real life, which was introduced into the District under the Ex-Orient Clifford Janey, which believes something about the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we need to continue working to offer the best interventions to those students who are under the level, Rhee demonstrated.
Others say that the results of the ENPE stress the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the general performance of the system and even provide additional money and resources for low-release schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here is a species of scattered dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studied town tests.
The solution of the conventional policy is to address their resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
The objective can then generate political impacts against that important cronogramme.
But the problem, of course, is that, as other urban superintendents, it is trying to touch the medium-white and black class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build an excellent school system.
We have to strengthen our barriary schools, so all families, without taking into account where they live, have confidence that their children can be able to a good public education.
Janey, now overseer of the Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end with the difference in performance is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to competite with self-schools.
It has to reach almost 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, who has reached an agreement with his teachers' syndicate last year in a year of 185 days, which considers a "a" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Make the higher education a part of more future
The tourist bus arrived at the Gettysburg University with a strong result.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descended and parpaded for a moment before the white columns, the ladrillo fabrics and the esmeral praises.
Graciela's parents had just graduated at a secondary school of El Salvador.
Even so, Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never put a feet in a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the registry costs $38.690 per year, her was less than the invitated who were impressed than the potential student enthusiastic.
Yes! Here I will be! Greciela, who would like to study medicine, when the leader announced that they had entered the science building.
Caray, really? said thoughtfully, when the leader talked about the low proportion of school teacher-students.
The Pennsylvania University was the seventh that children had visited at their trip of three days, and had already absorbed completely their deliberated message: The question is not whether you're going to university.
The question is what.
Although there is growing concern for the large number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who leave secondary school or are pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education that needs to meet the average class.
In fact, one of the five of these "second generation" is graduated at the university, a notable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexican and Central Americans, entered into the United States without finishing the secondary school.
Their success stories are important, researchers, because they indicate the way to follow a generation that will play a role of great importance in the country's work force.
Those who analyze the higher performance say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an intimate trend to succeed.
Many parents also have high objectives for their children and find ways to compensate their family lack with schools and schools.
But safeguard programmes can also play a role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach university, especially if efforts are supported at time.
In view of children of low income, whose parents have no experience and ability to help them navigate through the system, it is deducted that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a research at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from the infant garden to the secondary school.
The federal programme that financed the tour by Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than 300 million dollars per year to local school systems to implement university preparation programmes, which begin when low income students are at the average school and continue until the secondary school ends.
Since 1999, the programme has assisted more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent of the university, is the United States Education Department.
The Ministry of Oil of Iraq reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has reached important petroleum companies to rebuild its infra fragil during two substances that ended the Sabbath.
The 10 agreements that the Ministry of Oil of Iraq reaches with foreign petrol companies suggest that China, Russia and European petroleum companies are prepared to play a main role in the restoration of the Oil Industrie of Iraq, Muti; for deity of wars and sanctions.
Companys and companies have been remotely raised in only two of the 10 substances.
Seven companies and companies were paid to participate in the second submarine, which eats on Friday.
The only one that presented a offer was lost.
Two companys and companies reached agreements for awards understood in June.
The poor representation of oil and oil giants in the opening of the Iraq petroleum industry was aware of the analystes.
Iraq finally opened his doors after six years of war, and instead of companies and companies, there are Asian and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Petroleum Forum, a online news center.
It will take long before something else is offered in Iraq.
The security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombs on Tuesday, and political instability while military and responsibility turns away, have probably prevented oil companies and the risk of more energy in Iraq, which has the third most important preservation of the world's crude, have been analystes.
Companys and companies were in some cases in disappointment because rivals, in particular Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the government, have work costs to be considered less and are more intended to take risks because they do not respond to the public.
Exxon-Mobil and O°O Petroleum Inc were the only companies and companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main signatures and signatures, such as Chevron and ConocoPhips, which have been linked to the Ministry of Oil Iraq and have provided technical advice in recent years, have been removed with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts granted this weekend.
The National Corporation of Petroleo, the property of the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and achieved large investments in contracts for two main awards.
We know that China is in the way to become a main economic and technological power, showed the portfolio of the Ministry of Petroleum Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be at the couple of its competitors and will comply with its commitments to Iraq.
The pre-selected companies for proposals made offers that later were confronted with the Barril subvention that the minister had to pay to increase the production above the current levels of each juice.
The main planner of Al Qaeda was apparently murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a suspicious attack in the Pakistan border with Afghanistan has killed a main operating planner in Qaeda this week, said on Friday, the officers of the contro-terrorism and officials.
If it was confirmed, this would be the second death attack against a high-range terrorist leader.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men who thought that it had fallen on Tuesday when a couple of missiles affected their car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the North Waziristan province, was sources and Pakistanians and officers of the region.
The local authorities said that the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft of the type operated by ≥ within the illegal tribe zone of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, directly to the Afghanistan border, when the car had the impact, a officer of the Pakistan civil intellectual agency said, speaking on a phone from Miran Shah.
The officer said that the suspicious local military soldiers were predicted to the place and quickly confiscated what was left of the "fullly destructed body".
The local authorities were unable to verify the identities of victims, but two anti-terrorism officers and two men men mentioned unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
It was described to Somali as a high-range military planner of the Qaeda, who led operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was dedicated to conspire throughout the world, said a high officer, who spoke from the anonimated, quoting the delicate nature of air and air attacks within the Pakistan territory.
According to its central role, this probably included conspirative attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide of the superior command of the Qaeda and translated it into operational patrons for potential terrorist attacks.
The second officer said that Somali had quickly ascended into the rows of the Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups of the region.
It may not be a known name for some, but it does not decrease anyway the threat that caused us and our associates, the second official.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of the Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military faction in the tribe area, and three other high-range agents.
The time of non-pilot aircraft attacks led by the ≥ has decreased since the summer, from a average of approximately six operations per month to two, is a record of The Long War Journal, a website addressed by an unfruitful organization.
The reduction may be due to a tactic improved by terrorist groups, which have taken measures to limit their vulnerability while killing unexpectedly suspicious informants, the site was defeated.
Maximum sent by the United Nations in Kabul to reject
The maximum sent by the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would reject its position in March, completed with a tumultuous mandate that was seen damaged by corruption accusations extended in the presidential election of Afghanistan supported by the United Nations.
Eide's output occurs when Obama's administration has decided to send about 30,000 extra troops and troops to Afghanistan.
The UN sent said that it supports the increase, but he is concerned that the cronogramma and response for military retirement that begins in 18 months will stimulate other NATO governments to restore their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghanistan security forces and send the correct signal to Afghanistan so that they can trust the international community, Eide pointed out in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomatic also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officers cooperating with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civil sector, afermo.
Eide said he was not released, but simply fulfilling a promise that he made to his family in March 2008, that he was only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon, so I had time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it's better to start looking for a successor, Eide manifested.
When I arrived here, there was two months empty between the output of my precedent and my arrival.
Ban has started searching for a replacement, if the United Nations officers.
The officers say that they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who has recently addressed the United Nations mission in Bagdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who has previously conducted United Nations peace missions.
The position of Eide in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegated Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September to promote President Hamid Karzai in the presidential vote of the country and to cover evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the inevitations, but he said that Galbraith's accusations, who was dispedid, "surely hurt the mission, because there was a lot of scepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said that he proposed the appointment of a high civil representative to coordinate the efforts of assistance by the United States' forces in Afghanistan.
He also encouraged the United Nations leadership to allow its successor to make more personal contracts from the United States and other western countries, which are provided to the Afghanistan mission, in order to increase their confidence that their money is correctly used.
Eide expressed its frustration for limitations to its powers in Afghanistan, stressing that the United Nations engaging regulations dismissed their ability to capture talents.
That is how the United Nations rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, she manifested.
That's catastrophic and can't continue.
Gates: I will face additional sanctions
The Defence Secretary, Robert M. Gates, said on Wednesday that world powers will soon introduce "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, because of their failure to introduce conversations on their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, leading to a group of approximately 300 troops in the north of Iraq, during a trip of a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the perspective of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, as a response to the question of a soldier on the probability of such aid.
One of the things I am worried is that, if we have had something from Iraq during the last six years, it is the inherent invisibleness of the war.
Obama's administration is considering a package of sanctions addressed to Iran's military and political elite, but Gates pointed out that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
I understood that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and desincents," "to convince the Iranian government that they would really be less safe with nuclear weapons", because "they people will suffer greatly" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement of the Porter of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face "creasible consequences" if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that he wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peace purposes.
In discussions in Geneva on 1 October, he pointed out that he would again negotiate on the restriction of its nuclear programme and would accept a substantial part of its rich uranio reservation, instead of the fuel that is unexpectedly needed for a medical researcher.
The administration has pressed for that agreement, as a way to build confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
However, since then, Iran seems to have been removed from the tentative agreements, in part, experts, because the Iranian command has been divided in relation to the possibility of compromise with the United States.
In fact, I believe that Iran's endurance with the international community on some proposals which were actually accepted at the beginning of October has joined the international community, including Russians and Chineses, in a way that it has not been in terms of significant sanctions against the Iranian.
President Obama set as a date limit on 31 December to answer Iran to the proposals, before other options were replanted, even procured by what the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, called "devastating sanctions".
In a statement made in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations claimed that Wednesday was called "infunded and fair basic accusations" from some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said he had the will to continue with the conversations with the United States and other five world powers, "to achieve a close, long-term, solution."
Gates, who was going to return to Washington on Friday last morning, met with the Iranian Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurd region of Iraq rich oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdo officers in Irbil.
Tensions continue to be high between Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to borders, rights of property and participation.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for the conflict, to avoid any delay in the United States projects, to reduce the number of troops and troops from 115.000 to 50,000 to the end of August.
Gates also tried to deal with the Kurdish anxiety on the decline. The officers and officers cited the words of Gates to Massoud Barzani, the President of the Regional Government of Kurdish: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We won't leave them."
In an older China, a road change
Wang Weijia and her husband grew around by propaganda cards that were talking about the fact that "the Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby but means another tube."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shangai's government officers, alarmed by the lower birthday and the older people of their city, suddenly changed this summer and began to inhibit young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: no way.
We've already given all our time and energy for only a kid.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31 years old, a human resource administrator with a 8-month son.
More than 30 years after a single child's policy has been introduced in China, creating two generations of notorially discouraged children, unbelieving unclean children, appealingly "small emperors", is a demographic crisis in the country.
The average birthday has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six of when the policy has been effective, is the Division
The United Nations demographic, while it is expected that the number of 60-year-old residents will exploit from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is very higher than the average of approximately 20 per cent.
The unbalance is worse in the rich coast cities with very worshipped populations, such as Shangai.
Last year, 60-year-old and more accountable people have almost 22 percent of Shangai registred residents, while the birthday was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shangai Family Planning and Municipal Population Committee, has demonstrated that the feet couples must have children to "help to reduce the proportion of the older people and to attain a future lack of work."
Shangai is going to be "an old (not so rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he advised.
A gradual alivio
In the constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of a single son of China is probably the most polemical mandate introduced by the Communist Party until the date.
Parents who violate the policy are faced with a huge degree, until three times their annual deterioration in some areas, and working discrimination.
Chinese officers have assessed the policy for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have claimed abuse in the establishment of the policy.
In rural areas, some officers have committed pregnant women with a second child to submit aborts.
Furthermore, many couples have made abortions to be the sex of the fat, leading to a high imatural proportion of women.
In recent years, demography officers have gradually covered their position on single child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more excuses to the rule, including urban residents, ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and woman were unique children, and in 2007 many of their hard-line limbs were decreased.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor of the Demographic Research Institute of the University of Peking, said that central government officers have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single son.
In July, Shangai became the first Chinese city in launching an aggressive campaign to invoke more birth.
Almost the night in the morning, the cartels that commanded the families to have one child were replaced by copys of regulations that detailed who would be genuine to have a second child and how to ask for permission.
The city government sent family and voluntary planning officers to visit couples in their homes and slide brochures under the doors.
He also promised to provide emotional and financial orientation for those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officers say that the response has been very little abusive.
Deceptive Reply
Although officers of a rural city outside Shangai insist that they have observed a moderate increase in the requests of couples who want a second child after the campaign, the most urban citizens do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115.000, for example, is still receiving from four to five applications per month.
Shangai's disappointed officers say that, despite the campaign, it is still expected that the number of births in the city in 2010 only reaches about 165.000, directly greater than 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu community planning Committee in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want children.
They want to give your first son the best.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, of 26, said that they would like to have two children and are legally able to do it.
But as many Chinese, they have only the insufficient medical and life insurance that the government provides for them.
Without a network of social protection, they support that option would be irresponsible.
Western people wrongly see the unique child's policy as a question of rights, said Yang, a building engineer whose wife is pregnant for seven months of the first child of the couple.
Yeah, they're stealing us the chance of having more than a child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples quote psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resource administrator, said he wanted a single child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to take care of us all.
We are not used to care for others and we really don't want to care for others."
Chen Seiian, 42 years old, owner of a translation agency, explained it in a more constant way.
For parents with two carriers, of average class, who reduce the birthday, he aspired, it is to have enough success as to be selfish.
The people of between 20 and 30 years grew by seeing the battle of their parents during the first days of China's experience with capitalism and they don't want that kind of life for themselves, she manifested.
Even one kid has a long time from the parents, he has sustained.
A mother has to reject at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "you have to restore your apartment," and the strategy "he must have a curriculum prepared for the best guards when the child has nine months."
Most of your friends are willing to guard this once, said Chen, but not two.
Our is the first generation with the highest level of life, she manifested.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A group of the United Nations has a plan to reduce the reductions
The United Nations climate conference, which is still characterized by challenged positions and mutual rehabilitations, took a renewable attention on Friday with the publication of a document that predicted ambitious reductions of inver-effect gas during the nearby 40 years, with industrialized nations on their backs, most of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate inver-effect gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way to follow.
But it was seen as an important progress in a negotiation that remains without time, with more than 100 world leaders that will come to Copenhagen next week.
A United Nations ad hoc working group does not speak of how much money the poor countries would give to the poor to be held at the short and long-term global heat.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economys and the main emergency economys would cover their carbon production, and what would be the limit of the global increasing temperature that political strategies would be willing tolerate.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, high representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who edited the document of six pages, summarized a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the maximum United Nations climate officer, Yvo de Boer, described as "the great panorama".
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut off their estimates for 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Jointly, the countries would cut off between 50 and 95 per cent up to 2050.
The European Union also stimulated the discussions on Friday, promised to provide $3,600 million for the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change from waters and dry waters to deforestation.
Thursday, the same type of verbal artificial fires that have dominated the conversations last week.
The special climate sentence of the United States, Todd Star, is the request for mandatory coverage of inver-effective gases for industrialized countries, compared to the volunteers of the main economics, if they were not financed by the developed world.
The manual indicated that Obama administration has adopted a stronger line with China, as regards what Bush administration officers did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without the main developing countries to progress and take measures, Steern, who also regreted that the text did not have enough to ensure that the recovery could be verified by external observers.
Staren made its comments one hour after the Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei, would have lacked the maximum climate negotiator in the United States "common feeling", or was "very irresponsible" because he said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically with the global recalling.
With the future economic tragedy of the main potential of the world in the game, failure lines have made a eruption both within the developing world and between the industrial world and the outcoming economy.
The current battle is both to save individual economy and to save the planet with China and the United States, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries of the world ignore the empertitive science to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate of Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are discussing who should cost the costs to limit inver-effective gases, even when the vulnerable countries have been more aggressive in seeking to contain the major responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemonia is developed, Ulate, who also works as regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of the most vulnerable countries on the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally mandatory treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants said that the discussions would produce a political agreement.
The Small Insular States Alliance, with 43 members, prepared a proposal for a preliminary treaty of 24 early pages on Friday morning.
Arturge-Metzger, who is heading international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the empire of the small island nations has "invoked political pressure on the entire political process" in part because they are now united and require the action of emergency economys, such as China and India.
The discussions took a new emergency while the delegates focused on the fact that most of the public issues should be resolved before the Governing Boss conclude a treaty.
High-level officers, such as the Indian Ministry of Environment Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Minister, descended from the aircraft and walked to the Bella Center's passports, at closed doors and press conferences, to be able to distort the claims that will be arbitrated for the next week.
The absolute disorder of the Property (which 13,000 people every day come and leave from the centre of the convention, the activists who touch the guitarra present burlandosis nights of the countries they are selling, and preliminary proposals are made in hand instead of mail) is a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all the key ministers are here at this time, and Wednesday 60 government heads are in Copenhagen.
Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, President of the Global Conservation Policy, said that we are in the older lines.
The heavy weights are coming.
The first train at 225 kmh of Great Britain refines this feeling of Monday
On Monday 5.13 in the morning, a silvestream will perfore the darkness to indicate a train output that marks a revolution for traveling in Great Britain.
The first high-speed train of the country will reach the 225 kmh, when it passes as a stream from Ashford, Kent, to the St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, on board of the first interurban Javelin service outside London.
He expects the new service to finally connect to British to a international rapid, reliable train network and connect the large concurrences of Midlands, North and London.
The disadvantaged separate areas would become suburbs, business travel times would be shortened and the change of aircraft and cars to railway would reduce the national car rentals, as well as the congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of thousands of billion pounds that are needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and fear of environmental damage can still breathe the high speed lines of Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a viability study to the Government, will submit his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, assumed by the Times.
This will provide you a detailed ittary of the next planned step for the high speed network.
The new line that London at the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metric radio in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be polemic.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radio of 25 meters of a definitive road.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a higher speed network than the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in primavery.
The preferred option you are offering is a configuration in the form of Y, in which one high speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided in or near Birmingham, with a branch that leads to the west from the Peninsula to Manchester and Others to the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
Only one line would come in.
"It seems to be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railway.
Once finished, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tragedy, which would not be insulted before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a little more than one current hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 402 kmh, converting to the British network to the fastest Europe.
The initial road is designed to support trains of 400 mt length, transporting 1.100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a line of London-Birmingham.
This means that a London terminal would need to get 200,000 passengers per hour.
In view of capital space restrictions, an existing station is expected to be extended to the high-speed network.
Experts of the railway industry stress that only the St Pancras International or Euston station offers this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he thinks that the scheme should be conducted, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until a general election.
Even if the work is running, the network should be built in sections.
At the beginning, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines by the carriers in the north of Birmingham, maintaining the travel time between London and London over the three hours.
This is considered the crucial point necessary to ensure a change in train aircraft, a reference point for railway revolution.
contributors are with the hypoteque by a naranjal of £75,000 of a Conservator
Alan Duncan, the voter of the Conservator Party, covered the contributor thousands of pounds per year for the cost of a Naranjal who built in the house of his electoral.
The voter of the party's premiums, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaint that the members lived "for rations", increased their hypoteca in £75,000 to build an enmar in roble in their second house in Rutland.
They allowed the contributor to load the additional interest, summing hundreds of pounds per month.
The authorities of the Communities Chamber adopted the applications at their time and were not consulted by Sir Thomas Leg, who conducted a review of the expenditure of the members.
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, has a two-site house in a city in its electoral place of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The low plant includes a kitchen, a room of stay and a meal, but the honorary office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, a winter added to the house, described in the plans as a "national".
The neighbors described it as "a winter for entertainment".
Mr Duncan was not asked to make any reference on the increase in the loan during a recent investigation of the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the Communities House on its previous hypotechary agreements.
Last month, the Committee decided to violate the rules after an investigation of its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a 17406 pound of his ownership from London at the house of his electoral employment, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before he became a member.
The documents distributed this week show that Mr Duncan was requesting about 1.400 pounds in hypotechary interests until March last year.
In April, their applications increased more than £800 per month.
The rate of interest of Mr Duncan's Real Bank's Hypothics did not change at that time, suggesting that all increases would finance the loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard BRE's standard hypertechnological type decreased by 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, the type of which is now located.
The latest document issued by the Common Chamber Authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to request £50 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his work as a president of the Opposition of the Chamber in September, after a reporter on the film said that the Members had to survive after the expenditure scan.
"It is basically nationalized, you must live in races and be treated as m**rda."
He admired: "I'm putting my money in my garden and requesting a small fraction based on what is proper.
And I could ask much more, but I don't. "
The Member, a million for his former profession as oil trademaker, was first questioned about its expenditure in May, when it resulted that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he agreed with the salaries office that this could "be considered to be responsible".
A activist covered a bullet with the form of the symbol of the sterline library in Mr. Duncan's cespedia as a protest, after it was revealed that he requested 4.000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when you were asked about the increase of the hypoteca, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primary improvements, approved both by the salaries office and later by the Legal."
He added: "It is not to flee and crime or cook the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, there are rules, authorised and all.
It couldn't be in any clearer or simpler way."
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Adventure of the Beach of Brighton
Brighton's palaces have found a new impulse for winter months in a calendar of the Interactive Adventure.
Furthermore, an alternative religious group who encourages the spiritual exploration to creativeness invited 24 owners to decorate their packets for each December, using wildlife as their theme.

"We want religion to be more relevant for people, in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we like the Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in emotional ways.
"The idea of the event calendar of the palace eats as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incrediblely creative and vibrant place and we are trying to test and represent it to the spirituality."
Massive climate mobilisation in Copenhagen and worldwide
Tens of thousands of manifestants protested this Sabbath on a ambitional and vinculating agreement to fight global heating worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police stopped several hundreds of people.
Approximately 30,000 people, the police, hundreds of thousands, the organizers, were thrown by the Danish iron capital in claim of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach at Friday 1 January 2013, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the Climate Conference, the increased climate mobilisation throughout the world, represented by these manifestations, contributed to "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents were quickly cut off after the beginning of the manifestation in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all black clothing, broken off with a dogs and martyrs, reported a journalist of the AFP.
The anti-disturbance police is quickly and firmly interviewed.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 persons in total, if it is, particularly members of the Black Blocks, ultra violent groups already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the manifestation organizers, claimed the conditions in which hundreds of military men were detained "without distinction" and underlined that a hundred of them were "immobilized on the street on the Sabbath on the Married night and sitting despite the intense cold".
The manifestation, quite peaceful, went out of Parliament and took the Bella Center, the seat of negotiations.
The manifestants stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A scenario was raised to accept the invited speakers. The former South African arzobishop of the City of Cabo, Desmond Tutu, ends a victory.
Most manifestants arrived in the car and train of the large European cities, but many Asian, including Chinese and Korean, were also present as some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of them with heavenly clusters responded by forming a first concentration morning in Copenhagen to the Convocation of Earth Friends to form "marines to Âes" by "justice and climate".
Today, we are taking the streets to ask compensation for the debt for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a military Philippine of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue saying, there's time, the Beninese song of Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that are dry, water courses that can be walked as never before.
For the first time in the history of the climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the antiglobalisation movement approached the organizations.
The French Commissioner José Bové, the figure of antiglobalisation, explained that I came to Copenhagen to "unify climate justice and social justice": "then the fight against global heat is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Asian region, which gathers many very vulnerable islands at the heating, gave the initial pointapie to demonstrations.
Organizators are held, about 50,000 people went out on the street.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, in the majority of their students, broke red clothes and shield panneels with lemas for solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of manifestants who claimed to act energyly against climate change.
In France, the manifestations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marsella (South), Lille (North), Burdeos (Western) and Lyon (East).
In Ginebra, tens of people were concentrated.
The separatist Abjasia chose president, although Georgia claimed "fraude"
This Sabbath Abjasia, a prolonged separatist region of Georgia recognised by Moscow for more than one year ago, chose the president; however, Tbilisi claimed "fraude".
Some 130,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Osetia, another Georgian separatist region recognised by Russia.

In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216.000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After his separation from Georgia during the conflict of 1992-1993, which ended with several thousands of dead, Abjasia demonstrated through this election that is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new age as an independent state, declared to the AFP Svetlana Kvaria, a 54-year history, which was likely to have voted to Bagapch.
She was among the electors who went to the electoral table at a capital school, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palms in the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with suspicious landscapes at the border of the Black Sea.
Great tables shown in Bagapch near the president and the Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places of this small territory of 216.000 inhabitants.
In Gali, at the West of the country, the leader of the country, Archba, accepted warmly the Russian responsibles who came to control the development of the slavery.
In a short ceremonie, he said: We, the people of Abjasia, thank Moscow's support, and very particularly the decision to recognize Abjasia's independence.
I hope that its country is quickly recognised by the United Nations, Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, raised its wodka vessel.
On its hand, the opposition represented in the election by former President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscu last year, as a result of the control of the 10-year-old railways.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, states that it does not support the current power or opposition.
Most of the 50% are needed more than one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this shadow, a second return of two weeks later will be organized.

History and geographical allocation is strengthened from the reform of secondary education, see Chatel
The National Ministry of Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be transmitted in the Saturday Information (JDD, if its French Section) that history and geographic would be "fortalecidad" from the reform of the general secondary education, despite being removed from the mandatory education in the second year of scient bachillerate.
From now on, all students of the first bachillerate will have four hours a week and the same programme for a common culture, Chatel.
For the Minister, "may with hypocrisy" is, therefore, he is, "the branch C is no longer a citizen's branch", but "in general, call the best students."
The branches General Teaching and Literary can't be underlined by C, even underlined: "I didn't even hear that historians or intellectuals were angry because they had removed history and geographic in second bachillerate in the technological schools."
A IFOP survey published on the Sabbath in L'humanité revealed that approximately seven French ten (69 per cent) disapproved the governmental project to remove the mandatory history-geographic education in second of Bachillerate C. Numbers of intellectual and teachers, the left and some of the electoral representatives of the deity also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister agreed that "not speaking" would remove philosophy from the second bachillerate C programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of educational training, while 16 organizations (studiants and syndicates) called on a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which sacrifices them, the pedagogic training of the future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, the Minister explained a test of admission to their discipline, and at the end of the year.
In addition, they will practice in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year before the school as teachers in practice.
If you do all the practices proposed before the concurrence, you will already have a great experience in the school, which is, more than 300 hours, has been aggressed.
Finally, the Minister notes that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in the National Education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Superior Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain in a way convincedly the climate development
Fifty minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summary, the challenge that he accepted the Sunday morning, Jean Jouzel, president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street General Higher School.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Prize of Peace, invoked the "Ernest" conference route, a day composed of a series of fifty-minute expert presentations, filmed and opened to the public, informed a journalist of the AFP.
We wanted to do something that affects people and transmits them more to know, explained in the 22-year Edouard Hannezzo conference, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school stain.
We had some twenty participants among the experts of their discipline and chose them on their carism side, he needed.
About global heating, "We can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said the AFP Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphs in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientist role, he stressed expecting the public to understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a scientific document extremely serious".
Videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school site from December 15.
For February, the next day "Ernest", followed by others to a bimestral rythm.
Delay in payments: disturbance between prison guards, action is intended
The prison guardians invited on Friday to a "general mobilisation" to pay the payment before the finishing feasts of the year, the extra hours and the extra hours, which was placed up to eneropore budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Work Force (2th guardian syndicate) requested the staff out of service to join the manifestation on Tuesday morning before the claims and "lock them" to claim the robe of their hairs.
The Penitentiary CGT (3th syndical of the profession) invites them to "meet themselves in general assemblies in the various premises to achieve massive mobilisation" because the "sound and inacceptable" style of the incomplete of the payment in December of the "external hours, early nights, Sundays and festival days" worked in October.
And the first guards syndicate, the Federal Autónoma Penitentiaria Union (Ufap/Unsa), "convocation to general mobilization... in order to increase disappointment and anger".
The Directorate of Penitentiary and the Ministry of Justice explains that extra hours increased much in 2009 and not all were accountable, but they ensure that the saldo will be abonned in January.
On the last hour of the day, the Cancilleria informed that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to guardians guarantee that the payment would be carried out next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernization of our penitentiary system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I asked the Penitentiary Direction to implement immediately a set of measures to ensure that this situation, generated by a bad evaluation of the number of extra hours, will not again occur in the future.
The payment of December will then be low, except for the staff of the address that enjoys the benefit of the famous primes for functions and objectives, and that "every commits the fault to budgetary requirements", Ufap/Unsa deployed.
It's a real scandal, said indignatedly the interregional FO union of Marsella, announcing its decision of boico to the new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not work on Sundays and Festival Days if the month of October is not paid in December, the same will happen with extra hours, also threatening FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time we increase the tasks and missions without taking more effective, it is more than regretable to attack the staff's salary, estimates the CGT of Burdeos' penitentiary.
Syndicates are held, not in all regions, because some have more happiness than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected, the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he does "better gifts" than those receiving
The Chairman, Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first Christmas in the White House, admitted to the television presentation, Oprah Winfrey, that came to a simple conclusion about the gifts: "I do better gifts than those I receive."

U.S.: The lawyer of Polanski asks again to disapproval the cause
The French-Polaco Roman Polanski Chinese lawyer reckoned again this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western of the United States), which disapproval the cause against his customer, who is under home arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse over 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer of the Director of the "El Planist", claimed to three judges of the Appeal Chamber of the Second Californian District, serious procedure errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel declared: I claim that at the same time the charges are disappreciated, since the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "scalofriendly resulted".
If he was, Judge Rittenband (after that time) would have spoken with a fiscal who would have commented that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before saying judgment, which is a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was published in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, searched and desired), from the mouth of the fiscal concerned, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed to celebrate a sentence that would allow you to submit the evidence of its argument if the Court disapproval the case.
The accusation, on its part, repeated the argument expressed in the first instance, which is that there could not be seriously assessed any disapproval of the charges in both Roman Polanski had not been submitted to the court.
The Chinese, age of 76, fled from the United States in 1978 before his sentence was dictated by "illegal sexual relations" with a less than 13 years of age.
Since then, he has never been riding the United States again.
Phyllis Asayama said that Roman Polanski "should be here to be presented in the audience."
For this reason, we want to transmit the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused ones, that there is the possibility of escape?, asked Asayama.
For her, the cinemaist "demands a favor to the court, even though he has its authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce their sentence, also highlighted that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee.
Hummel was not the only one who asked to disapproval the cause against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
It states that your client no longer supports it every time it resurrects the case of Polanski, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by order of North American arrest.
After more than two months after the tricks, he was sentenced to home prison at Gstaad's cab, waiting for an extra.

The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," is your son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday " are very positive", he assured his son David on Friday when he came to the port of Los Angeles to join his hospitalized father since several days.
News are very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going out very well, declared to the press David Hallyday at the downstairs of the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after the 13.00 p.m. (21 h GMT).
The son of the song, the son of the song, assured himself that he would be "when before" to the Cedars-Sinai hospital of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered Monday by a infection resulting from the discal hernish operation on November 26, in Paris.
The musician is "in the coma induced from that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid suffering and to be able to handle your treatment," the press service indicated.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subject to a coma induced by the doctors of Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered Monday by an infection, followed by a discal hernish operation on 26 November in Paris.
The song was operated again on Wednesday night on Thursday because of serious disappointments made by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French school in Los Angeles, whom you attended her daughter Jade, to present a school act, confirmed a ́AFP ́grapher.
The Boss of Ortopedia and Traumatology of the Hospital of Pitié-Salpetrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the song.
The manufacturer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurociruian who operated the song last 26 November in the international private clinic of the Monceau Park in Paris.
They told us that it was a massacre.
The chirurgs in Los Angeles said that they were injured, said Camus.
It's talking about a possible request, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus stated that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too quickly to Los Angeles with the authorisation of the Paris chirurg."
I talked directly to the doctor, and I was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem to travel, because I was operated twice discal hernium, he aggressed.
Shortly before in the RTL, he indicated that when the song seemed to have gone "with no canule, nothing", then his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very known in the art environment.
He operated the Marie Trintigant actriz in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where Delajoux worked at that moment.
In 2007, I also interviewed Charlotte Gainsbourg actriz to reabsorb a hematoma based on a brain blooding.
It is a doctor with a bad reputation, condemned by justice in several times by bad practice, as well as by fiscal and staff fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Order of Medicines, accused him of being "a man without slaves" requested "regularly" before the Order Council, and is "leaving to be recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday by his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention was "without any inconvenience" and that the results of post-operational studies were "normal".
The operation " couldn't provoke bloody and thus didn't need drenage," he aggregated.
Anyway, the girdle of the song, whose health problems are multiplied since the summer, entered a parentesis.
Any doubt, to repeat the round on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as it was intended, I seem very risky, said Camus.
The UDF association lifts up the tone and warns the New Centre on the use of its seal
The UDF association (UNION for the French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democracy Movement) of François Bayrou, repeated this Friday before the intention of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, of launching an OPA (Publical Provision) on the sign of the former giscardist party, intimized him to remove it from all supports, just to be requested.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to restore the UDF center, since he believed that François Bayrou was not in position to defend his political inheritance after he had stretched his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Defence Minister, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
As support for its management, he received the aid of Mr Hervé de Charrette (ex UMP, current NC) who re-registered the property of the UDF mark, because it was the first to register it in the National Industrial Propriété Institute in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF association office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou that they did not want private verses of this, breaked the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the member intimate to reject them to the center and to transfer the rights of the mark's own rights, only for a legal request.
In these last days, you have made many statements suggesting that you would propose your political movement to restore the UDF center, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Central Aliance.
They also believe that it is proper to continue using the name of the movement, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in its military material and on the page of presentation of their site, support the signers of the letter.
As they already know, they have no right to use the sign, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to return "the name of the UDF immediately from all supports, as well as from (su) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (la) mark to the legal rightshearted."
Without doing this, justice will be invited to comply with the law and rights of the members of the UDF, the signers shall be warned.
In the letter, they need that UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and they recognize that Morin and his friends "elected" went in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre does not have, if they are, any right to use the UDF sign.
They also recall that the latest UDF convention voted in 2007 for three years with its accession to the MODem and the creation of a office responsible for defense of "the material and moral interests" of the movement based on Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charrette, guard the office, "when he registered the mark", he was no longer "member of the UDF from three years ago", but the UMP.
Use scandally and fraudulently the UDF acronym register absence to perform it by its account.
This indiscretion is being transformed into crime, they claimed, before we get out of the NC strategy: "We believe in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make its own name than to get out of the anonimate by taking a fraudulent name to the unrighteous."
Caso Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged by deficiency abuse
This Wednesday, the Court of Nanterre decided to submit judgment to artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the multimillionary Liliane Bettencourt, it was used from the state of the octogenian deficiency to expoliate her from a part of her happiness.
The 62-year-old photograph of the spectacle will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 by deficiency, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum penalty of three years of prison and 375.000 euros of debt.

But the Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered that the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt was subject to a medical exam of three medical professionals.
The inheritance and main employment of the Oreal has always refused to undertake these examinations, even more in the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Fisheries during the investigation.
The doctors designated this Friday shall submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which they should find out whether Liliane Bettencourt has suffered deficiency states and during which periods.
I think you'll accept it.
I'm going to talk to her, Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kieman, said when the audience is out.
By its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was delighted in the decision of the court.
It's a good news... The research will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we should protect, was aware.
Since two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter initiated criminal action against François-Marie Banier, a multifactic artist, accused of having been used for years of his mother's deficiency to gain billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or art works.
By its part, Liliane Bettencourt always refused to have been manipulated by the dictionary, whom he considers a long-term friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the proceedings of the action interacted by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' advocates, in some cases, resulted in a great family confession.
In this way, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt took into account three letters that her customer would send to her newspaper (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she said he was disloyal to the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt adds, the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter I wrote to Banier between one and two times per day for fifty years.
Since his wedding, I could never again talk to Francoise."
On its part, the Office of Nanterre considered, once again, that the applicant was not able to appear, as far as a judge of the guards had been refused in these last days to make its request to open a procedure for the protection of the judiciary for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "he has full ability to appear before justice, is not under protection and has no tutor.
Nobody else can appear in his place," advised the representative of the Public Ministry, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that once the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be made.
General Revolution or End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the large French companies, our fight for the development of business intellectuality would have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the leading of the large companies in relation to their employees repeals the position of the companies in relation to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is that co-operators are attached to "values" specified from above as it was intended to impose consumers products thought by manufacturing techniques.
By putting the customer in the centre of the company, the marketing revolution gave place to market conquist strategy... although the author's temptation to impose products that are not related to customer preference factors is regularly repeated.
A dismobilization of employees can end in a mortal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the point of iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives.
This dismobilization commits seriously the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially I+D and, more, of business intellectuality.
In fact, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all involved parties... have a proactive behaviour and a prospective vision"; it requires the employees a commitment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of a author address.
For this reason, we invited a general revolution, which would consist of putting collaborators in the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion investigations have a relative utility
Will internal opinion investigations, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, encourage the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I could check that, in front of a new situation, and after a lot of flights, all companies ended to do essentially... what they always did!
- Secondly, because the author, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most guidelines have a simple vision of human behaviour.
As they come from the large engineer schools, they interpret psychology mechanically.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the ancient conducting theory that "neurocities" and" recently reactivated, and that the Study Institutes and Media have spread largely to their backs.
In this way, suggesting that it is possible to handle the "commands" (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent research from Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr restores the directors in a mechanistic management position, which is unadaptated to the world today.
Install and measure mobilisation factors
In contrast, the management revolution needed for the good function of modern companies should adopt a finalistic vision of human behaviour.
You have been able to integrate in any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for the employees, the commitment with the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make real part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies resulting from Motifuncial Analysis adopt this concept of the motivations of employees.
Studies showed that they judge their company based in a standard dock that allows them to evaluate what it offers to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and me of mobilization factors, companies' guides can control, predict and predict their "social performance" and reject human resource management "in the place".
In this way, they create a favourable area for the development of a strong and effective business intellectual.
Oslo speech: by the "just war" Obama receives elogies from the de
This Wednesday, the North American, satisfies that the Nobel Price of Peace 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, claimed the speech Obama had spoken on Thursday.
The conservators, who had discredited the delivery of the premium to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential talk, as well as Sarah Palin, former candidate to the presidency during the elections of 2008.
I was pleased with what he said, Mrs. Palin said, the main figure of the republican party's headquarters at the US Today magazine, and she appreciated herself to have addressed the theme of war "at times necessary" in her recently published memories.
In my opinion, war is, since then, the last thing northern Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
He's got to stop terrorists, he noted.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his preacher George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, was dedicated to this Thursday in Oslo to justifie the resource to force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, thought that the president had done "a very good work" in Oslo.
I think the talk was really very good, the former President of the Chamber of Representatives, which especially appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At the moment, the talk appeared to me very historical, Gingrich declared, during an interview in the "The Takeaway" radio program.
The former electoral representative, which some consider as a potential candidate to the Republican investment for the presidential elections of 2012, was pleasing to listen to the "left president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee " that they would not be free or could deliver a peace premium if the resource to the force was not existing."
Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's talks and current cronista in Washington Post, Obama called "a very north-American talk".
Besides being presented as "the world's citizen", as "always doing it," "he spoke as a North American president" when he remembered the Europeans "they live in a security bullshit that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson acknowledged.
Among the little of not very convinced, a Bush's era halcion, the former ambassador in the United Nations, John Bolton, qualified the speech of "monoton, pretensive and missing inspiration" on the Internet National Review Online site.
At the left of the President, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed when he saw Barack Obama by justifiing the resource to force.
When we cover war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justifie the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the left center pressured the president.
The Angeles Time, although still believed that Obama received the Nobel preliminaryly, qualified his speech of "superproduction" especially for a speaker known by his talent.
Oslo's speech "should be used as a road sheet to guide international decisions in the fight against conflicts, poverty and oppression", commented enthusiasmly on the Californian journal.
Obama "pronounced the discourse that was necessary", recalled New York Times, judged it "at the time of shame and building".
Road transport: three marathonic negotiations to ensure ship supply
Following three marathonic negotiations, the travel sector syndicates and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only patronal organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement that ends the consignment and threats on maritime supply.
The signature session on Friday night, the Secretary of Transport State, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" by the agreement, after several negotiations started on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left on Friday with the hope of signing the text quickly at the last hour of the morning.
Even when three patronal organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) were retired by giving a port.
But one of more than six hours starting at 11 hours was necessary to all agree and the text is signed at 18 hours.
The conflict "had been very dangerous for businesses" and "further fear of disturbing the end-year festivals," Bussereau stated.
The text provides an increase of 4% for lowest salaries (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for higher (international transport).
The tariff per hour exceeds EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06 for low salaries.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disappointment, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, let's order our soldiers that there are no more shorts or blocks in the supply centres.
But there can always be some disconformed revolt, he felt.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, recognized that it was "good agreement", although it was "difficulty to grant increases to high salaries taking into account international competition".
If it is, the increases will be in the range of EUR 170 men for low salaries and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
It is a common agreement and respecting the assalaried, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides an increase in the 3% movement costs and the celebration of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will enable, in particular, to address the issue of an extraordinary payment and the modernisation of the collective convention.
Bussereau recalled that "a lower of 100 million euros in patronal burdens" was subject to an amendment of the Government in the 2009 Corrective Finance Act, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The signature of TLF allows the agreement first to apply to enterprises attached to this organization and, secondly, to the whole profession, if the Minister of Works.
It'll be "with the most shortest," assured Bussereau.
Opposition of patronal organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR claimed that it was a "proof negotiation", since the 100 million euros had already been promised to the sector to compensate part of CO2 tax.
The Secretary of Transport State forced us to negotiate in a emergency situation, not as a conclusion of an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who want to eat paus at the next dinner of Nochebuen, Unostra was regreted.
For the OTHRE, the agreement is a risk for "the stability of many SMEs in the sector during the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, disconformed syndicates with the RATP proposals
The conflicts in the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, because on Friday, the second day of breakfast between syndicates and the RATP address, there was no agreement and the syndicates remained inadequate in respect of their first request.
For this important weekend of shipbuilding, Saturday and Sunday will only have trains between 10 and 20 hours, due to a train of each two in the central tram ( between Defence and National) and a train of each four in the other lines.
Interconnection with SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change train.
The Lafayette Gallerys, who expect 2000,000 clients every day, were glad that "the RATP is trying to make service to the big tents."
The RER A cross from Western to East the Paris city.
The RATP trame runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Valleye.
This Friday, approximately one of the two trains held in hours of point, and almost no train in valley hours, as expected.
Thursday, there was no disorder in the Andes thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the French Island.
In this way, at the alba, the St. Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less competitive than normal, especially by the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, explained that it had been raised "a hour and a half ago to reach the time".
The Station Saint-Lazare was not saturated, indicated the SNCF, which had planned the supervision of police and order forces.
The RER A that operates the SNCF resulting from Cergy-Le-Haut or with a destination to this were arrived or parted from the St. Lazare station to join the meters.
The new general assemblies of workers in the holiday will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analysed, "no satisfying" are the syndicates, of a responsibility that was held on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects of the RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
This is not what the drivers want to claim a premium to them, it is said Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even sets its first proposals between parentesis, commented indignatedly by the CGT, pointing out that the address "is not able to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved."
A new Monday is expected to perform "a more analyz on the conditions of exercise of the profession," the RATP needed.
What also led to the syndicates to say that the company "doesn't care for the users of the end of the week."
On the morning, approximately 150 drivers invaded a committee in the seat in Paris.
Then the address, which was until then refused to dialogue during the hole, suggested the "to quiet the waters".
The conflict could be extended to the RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independent have submitted an admonition.
Syndicates ask for a premium of EUR 120 to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Indipendents) and complain about the degradation of work conditions in this line with a million daily passengers.
The RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, cover from 2.200 to 2.700 brute euros and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, by hours with alternative tours, Sundays and Sundays.
Turkish justice solves the procured party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Friday for the resolution of the main procurement party of the country, a decision which immediately caused anger manifestations in the Kurda community, south-east country and Stambul.
This decision could very complicate the government's task, which just had a hand to the Kurd community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Partie of the Democratic Society (DTP) was resolved because it had become the "focus of activities that affected the State's independence and its indigenous unit," the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, stated to the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unique, although only a majority of seven votes was needed to get the resolution, Kiliç indicated, and he agreed that 37 of the leaders of the party, including their President Ahmet Turk and Mr. Aysel Tugluk, are parts of the political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity of which Turk and Tugluk enjoyed, and the confiscation of the goods of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 in Parliament (550).
His leaders warned before the sentence that the Members would leave Parliament before being parliamentaries without a party-label.
The decision comes on the basis of a procedure laid down by the Supreme Court of Justice, Abdurrahman Yalzinkaya, in 2007, which accuses the DTP to obey the "principes" of the Kurdishan Working Party (PKK), which was considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
A number of observers believe that the DTP is the legal political escape of the PKK revolves.
However, the party assures that it does not have "organic links" with the PKK, but it refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls the government to negotiate with him.
The Court's sentence intervenes at the time that the Government holds a hand to the Kurd community, proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP leaders said that a resolution could generate a recycling of pressures in Southeast Anatolio, where a large number of manifestations against the conditions of detention of the PKK head Abdullah Öcalan, have been degenerated in the case of police during the last weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of manifestants were gathered before the DTP sites in Diyarbakir, the large care of the Southeast population in their majority of courses.
The Forces del Orden dropped lacrimogene granates and used water canons, while the manifestants lanced Molotov bombs or stones with honeys.
In Stambul, hundreds were also concentrated closely.
After the verdict, Turk suggested that the decision of justice would "profondise the disappointment".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by solving a party, stated to the press.
The Government, formed by a party resulting from the Islamic movement, also regrets the decision.
First, we are opposed to the closure of games.
So nothing is solved, declared the Minister for Energy, Taner Yildiz.
This boicote decision completely opens the democratic opening launched by the government, commented by the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can, of course, wait for a PKK reaction, aggressed.
This Thursday, the PKK has been adjudicated to an attack in which seven soldiers died three days ago in the North of Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks of the last months.
Snows can start suddenly
A really fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is absolutely something that you want to make life impossible to the citizens, comments the ECF's winter road maintenance director
But with this, their employees can prove and dominate the entire vehicle technology.
At the end of the week, the eurologists may first announce it.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the FES acts in accordance with a mine plan.
As soon as the snow is promptly in Frankfurt and the temperatures fall under zero degrees, 20 of the called tramos A with big vehicles with salt, explains Brauburger.
Includes, for example, main arteries and avenities such as the Neue Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also access to the body of bombers, the roads of public transport, peatonal zones, and we travel with tents, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES's service begins around the three of the morning
They must cover approximately 1.040 km, if necessary, in a maximum of three hours with humid salt, which is better attached.
That is why the FES starts around the three of the morning, "with that the roads are free until it begins the traffic of the points of time."
The hard thing is when it starts to be unable to be around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," comments the winter road maintenance director, "for then no one is ready to clean space for the vehicles with salt."
Immediately after that, when you are not snowing anymore, it touchs the secondary and private roads, which also belongs to the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority has its sideways and secondary streets.
That's where the troubles are generated, you know, Brauburger.
About the five of the morning, it is running to the FES's infantery, mostly the dangerous and cross points are cleared.
Generally, the FES could not be charged by the entire carriers for bicycles.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose view mainly to the pools, comments Brauburger.
As they return quickly rebalds, the salt vehicle is running as soon as the temperature falls under two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The dinosaury’s nutrition
The Tawa findlae had the same aspect as many other carnivor dinosaures: a two-meter-long animal and 1,50 meter height running over the two strong back foots, had a broad head with ash and curves teeth, short arms with bottles in the form of hoz and a long cola.
If the species had lived a few million years later, this would not have been something special.
But the Tawa findlae was one of the first dinosaures with these corporate features, reporting Sterling Nesbitt from the Texas University in Austin and colleagues in the Science of Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what now is New Mexico, which then was in a dry area of Pangea supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window to the early evolution of the dinosaures, comments Nesbitt.
We show much about the genealogic relations, the propagation and the characteristics of the first dinosaures.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists started an excavation in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes, in one day, we have found a dozen of dinosaurial bones, this is something without seeds of the Triaxis, reports Randall Irmis member of the Team of Natural History Museum of Utah.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the rest of five spectrums were gathered together.
A finding confirms the theories about the ancient history of dinosaures
The name "Tawa" comes from the god of the Hopi Indians' sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt is a detection of: "The Triasic dinosaurial fossiles are extremely rare, generally only individual fragments are found."
Other experts in dinosaur are not totally such an enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirm some theories about the ancient history of the dinosaures, for example, comments Martin Sander at the University of Bonn.
The current opinion flow was the dynamics appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaures is very controversy.
So the experts discuss, for example, about which the sauries were divided into their three most important genealogic lines: the carnivor theropodes of the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the square square pools known as "langue hair" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivors (sauries with bird pelves), who belong to the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
The analysis of Nesbitt and its colleagues is, Tawa findlae is a primitive theropode.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, commenting Nesbitt.
For example, in the Tawa crown, researchers found indications of air bottles, such as the seeds of the theropodes, the birds.
Thanks to the air bottles, the breathing of birds is more than those of the mammifers.
In the case of Tawa, also the bones of the vertebral column were apparently full of air partly.
Tawa is the theropode with the oldest and primitive air balls, comments Randall Irmis.
Since the line of the later giant sauropodes also had air and light bones, the common frontiers of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three halls towards North America
Since the most primitive dinosaures were still known in South America, researchers deduce that the Sauries had come for the first time.
Thus, the three genealogic lines were separated from a beginning and spread from South America through all the rivers of the Earth, which then still formed a single earthquake, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team met with Tawa the rest of two other non-intimate terapeuts.
The three cannot descend from a single emperor pre-cessor, the investigators argue.
We believe that at least three holes have been given to North America, commenting Alan Turner of the American Natural History Museum in New York, with the Science study.
Of course, there are also opposers.
An even older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of brothers of the dinosauries, lived in the current Poland, comments the palettetologist of Bonn Martin Sander.
Your opinion could give a distortioned image, because simply in South America are keeping many dinosaures fossiles, while there is only something to discover in other continents.
The question of how the dynamics have achieved evolution of a sideline of the reptils to the dominant earthquakes of the Mesozoic is still an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triaxis, dinosauries still had their vital space with many other reptils, such as the ancestors of the current cocodrils and the pterosauries and many other saries.
Before the end of the Triaxis, the dinosaures spread around the world and developed many new species, while the parenthood was extinguished at the border of the Triaxis towards the Jurasic.
The successful stories were not eternal
There are two chances to explain this change, comments Martin Sander.
It could have been given a massive extinction to which the dinosauries overcame for calcium, but the other reptils were not.
Or the dinosaures were better adapted, so they could win the contristants in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a consequence of a species' growth, which had also developed in the Triaxis and since then had a weak existence: the mammifers.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatures.
Teachers of the University of Toronto, Cambri, Vienna or Berkeley, in California.
They participate in Napoles teachers, Quebec, Edimburg, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police outcome of the occupied casino at the University Goethe of Frankfurt has been affected worldwide.
278 professors and catedrics of the University of Goethe, although also higher education centres in all Germany, Europe and South America, are sold with the students in protest in the Westend Campus.
In a German and English published statement, "on" is the police development promoted by the Directorial Board.
Werner Mıer-Estler, president of the university, made the building occupied by students and teachers in educational field because the walls and works of art were promoted.
As a result, five students suffered disappointments.
Material damage, the signers judge, does not justifie "the violent solution of the courses organized by the same students and catedrics by a police command".
The output represented a "inacceptable attack" to the freedom of research and investigation.
The approach on the vandalism served for "the delegacy and criminalization of the protest" and denied the attention of the content.
The Directorial Board has refused to initiate the necessary negotiations.
The teachers require the immediate recovery of the reckoning.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legislated Protest
Youths of the Green Syndicat and the German Federation of Syndicats are also solidarized with students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of an increased concern for the future, commented by the National Youth Secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kähne-Hörmann (CDU), the Ministry of Sciences of Hessen, however, defended the action of the university and police director.
We're grateful to the university director.
Destruction and occupation are completely inacceptable means, commented in a current Stunde issue on Thursday in the House of Wiesbaden province.
We are comprehensive with protest, but we are not comprehensive with vandalism, expressed Peter Beuth, delegated by the CDU by the Provinced Parliament.
The view of opposition factions, the SPD, the Green and the left, is different.
The CDU used as pretext the walls painted to criminalize the protest, expressed Janine Wissler (Izʹda).
Instead of studying the arguments and needs of the students, they are developed.
The Izda has presented an invitation, in which it is requested to present a report on the police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible for Western visitors.
Selected, one of the ten of Moscue, was a strongly preserved place in the Soviet Union for secret weapons research.
Today, the community of 216.000 inhabitants, which is 37 km from the centre of Moscow, is considered as the "Silicon Valley".
There are important research and production centres of micro-electronic and nanoelectronic.
Since September 2008, the representatives of Selenogrado have contacted Riedberg's center office in Frankfurt, university institutions and companys of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and now, Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg signed in Frankfurt a "East Cooperation Protocol".
Moscow Vice-Alcalde Juri Rosljak and Selengrado's colleague, Anatoly Sōnov, headed Russian delegation; by Frankfurt signed Edwin Schwarz Planning Service Boss.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized companies from the Research Centre of Natural Sciences will travel to a seminar in Selenogrado.
Science Switch
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also affects commercial relations.
FIZ firms will have the possibility of putting a foot on the growing Russian market.
In turn, Russian scientist companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selected is the seat of important Russian research undertakings and institutions.
There are, for example, the Moscovita Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronica consortiums.
The community was founded in 1958 as the "Socialist Planning City" for arming research.
Selected (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landing of forest mountains, where research facilities were located.
Frenos de Stuttgart
The Size of Stuttgart 21 is not placed for nothing as high enough.
For the partners of the project, "the new heart of Europe" is simply and suddenly addressed.
S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous building project, which will predict the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region a decade of chaos of irremediable building sites.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with ries, which ended in the middle of the city, were considered in the 19th century's then engineering fossiles, which acted as frens of a modern railway traffic, since anciently there was a great amount of time to engage back-to-forward remote engines.
Rotate, stop in dry way, but it must be done.
And therefore, the terminals were to be disappeared: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a station of pass, which is almost half of the traject of the trans-European operational lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, of the slogan of "Europe's heart".
The S21 will really be started, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with the reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have learned that in hessian capitals and bavarian capitals it is almost impossible to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals, of course, have no more input and output problems, since there are reverseable engines with tractor unit and car of the driver at both extremes.
However: Stuttgart 21, including the new ICE-building trame to Ulm, will already be started.
The Federal and Communal Policies have provided that way.
The railway continues also because the risks of the major infrastructure projects of the Republic are the contributor and not the State.
From the urbanistic point, the project is still justified to a certain point.
New urban space is created, providing from many green areas, probably from the graphs generated by the designer's computer.
For the railway transport system, S21 is damaged.
Step station and vial support are considered for transport of people, which has been assigned to the enormous typical growth of 1980.
At that time, no competition was given for low cost flights.
However, modern transport policy should first be involved in strengthening the transport of goods, since railway transport is considered more ecological than the cars carried out on roads.
However, the new building traces are good for load trains due to intense gradients.
More serious is that S21 also affects indirectly many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros should be buried in the Zus.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between ten and fifty million.
It is safe that in the next depth the money will be missing in other cross and close passengers on the network.
In total, sixty larger projects are found in the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 km of long riel to the Rin valley.
Since 1987 the trace is built slowly.
It would be urgent here to walk the accelerator as it is due.
However, S21 acts as freno.
The stream of the Rin valley will be the bottle bottle for international goods transport: a ≥ the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the sentence on the port.
The Federal Government leaves the autonomous parliament of Wiesbaden whether he will present a reckoning to the failure on the flight of the Hesse Administrative Court of Justice.
The coalition of CDU/FDP seems to have committed experts the legal investigation of VGH judgment on more than 400 pages, said the Minister for Economics, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had founded in writing at this date, that in the case of the construction of the North-West landing track planned in the Frankfurt port, the Federated State would have to regulate the flight of night.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as provided by the Federal Government, would not be consistent with the mandatory legal protection of the sound population due to air transit.
Coalition must be decided until 4 January, whether it will present the resource for appeal against this sentence.
The opposite criticized this postergation and pressed the representatives of the Government to reject the reckoning to the National Court of Justice in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD Group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises of Night Air Trade, which they had done before elections. Instead, this could be taken as a lack of word.
It's pretty difficult, if one allows him to fulfil his word, the leader of the Green Tarek Al-Wazir said, repeating the FDP slogan "We do our word."
Minister Posch ○ the re-evaluation of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the Federal Government would have been acquiring by distortions of the right and trucks, so that they would still get their night flights.
An exhaustive legal investigation would need enough time.
Coalition wouldn't want to act on the basis of a "First Quick Print".
We need a legally inappropriate decision, said Stefan Mıer (FDP).
As the opposite represents it, their group's situations would never have been regarded to the night air traffic.
U.S. Aids are returned.
Great and saddened by the crisis are dismissed from their state attitudes.
The Bank of America returned only once the aid provided by the Tarp Rescue Fund for a total of 45 billion (approximately EUR 3 billion).
The Citi group also plans for State aid, a report from the United States NCBC.
With this institutions are intended to be released from the restrictions they had taken from their hand with the acceptance of money, such as bonus payment to directors, as well as high tax payment.
The "Bank of America" had achieved approximately 19 billion liquid money to the conversionable goods.
The rest of the sum took it from the own box, which had a lot of means, among others for the sale of rubber.
The director Kenneth Lewis thanked on midnight, especially the contributors and the contributors: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult moments.
The house had wrongly calculated the effort to absorp investment in the climate of financial crisis.
The Citi group also intends to get money on the capital market to be able to be free from its obligations against the state.
The NCBC informed of the source of known circles that, for Thursday, it could already announce the increase in its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi Group did not want to make comments.
In June, they had already returned their Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick selection
At the end, everything was faster than you thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF administrative advice (German TV channel) is pressed on the Nikolaus Brender editor to leave its position, the channel can present a successor.
Yesterday night, the groom was intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of ZDF's main study in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the European Parliament, officially so that it would not be predicted to the procedure.
However, it was certainly also affected by the non-damaging of the ZDF Markus Schächter director if this proposal would not be also approved in the administrative advice.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs nine of the 14 members of the gremium.
The result of the vote has not yet been concluded with the end of this and it.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the administrative advice with his proposal to renew the contract of Nikolaus Brender for five years more.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's destitution was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Why the majority of the Union in the administrative advice for weeks before the election had indicated that they would not support Brander at its position.
The opposition against the head of the editor was organized by the President of the Government of Hesse, Mr. Roland Koch.
He rejected another mandate of the Prestigious Editor, with the argument that the ZDF information in the direction of Brender would have lost audiences.
Not long before the elections had been protested because of this, in which the political influence on ZDF was struck.
At the end, 35 public law specialists had been enrolled in the debate, which qualified Koch's proceeding as an inconstitute.
But he didn't serve anything.
About the Person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political, pedagogy and romantic philology.
Then he worked in the südwest and in the newspaper "Frankfurter ́dschau".
In 1983, ZDF was changed, first to the "heute-journal" information.
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal reporter of the editorial head; 1991/92 responsible in Washington; up to 1998 director and leader of the "Morgenmagazins" programme; up to 2001 the ZDF External Policy Director; since then the ZDF study director in the capital.
The Green Political Party announced a constitutional demand after Brender's destitution, which was still chosen as a journalist of the year by the Medium Magazin magazine.
The opposite of Koch in the administrative advice, the President of the Government of Renania-Palatinat, explained last week that federal states should change ZDF's state convention in such a way that the proposals of the Director ' s staff could not be locked by a majority with political motivation.
A retrace of partial politicians from ZDF control gramms was rejected by Beck.
The successor of Brender, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended before the administrative advice with a smart game: he criticized strongly the gremium for Brender's destitution.
Thanks to this periodic evidence of independence, both Schächter could appoint it for the head of the editor without the face, as well as the administrative advice could vote on it, without being suspected to give him the post to a sequence of a party.
In the estimates of the Frey partys, the liberals of the left are all of the ways offered.
College careers are divorced
Partial success for students: after a year of holidays related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the Federated States finally ceased. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university directors, both of them agreed to improve the conditions of study in cases of license and master.
Students in a future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of tests: basically every carrying module should end with one examination.
In addition, it is intended to examine the labour of students, and it wants to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and Universities also want to simplify the recognition of the results of reviews between Universities within and outside Germany.
Federated states are committed to confusion more flexible the rules of the rules together for carriers of Bachelor and Master.
Regulations of the Federated States that differ from this should no longer exist.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of the study protests in June, Ministers of Education and Culture and universities directors have continued to talk about the improvement of ability to perform and complete a career (studiability).
Now for the first time, it was spoken of a specific content.
The so-called acreditation advice agreed to drasticly reduce the amount of the reviews: "Each module ends with only one exam," it is said in a 30-page document, which is intended to regulate partly the approval of university careers.
With the "sensitive reduction of the burden of examinations" it is intended to avoid development in a wrong direction, which would be sensitively affecting the studyability, thus the Director of the Acreditation Council, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in a future, the "studiability" must be the decisive criteria in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be exhaustively examined as regards unnecessary restrictions for students in the election of.
the courses.
Students would have the right to get more spaces, which can and promote their own initiative.
These rules would be governed for new careers, but also in the review of existing careers.
These must be "recredited" again every five years, but this would mean, that it would be late until 2015 to examine all careers.
The responsible for this would be 10 accreditation agencies throughout the country, which are under the supervision of the acreditation Council, which is installed by the federal states.
Ministers of Education and Culture encouraged the federal states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of materials and examinations are not too strict or urgent.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with the ministers to adopt such measures.
Until now, only Renania-Platinada has ensured to facilitate additional means for the subsequent development of the Bolonia process.
With this money, universities must implement programmes of protection and study advice, as well as strengthening studies and external offices.
The Federated State and universities intend to have 10 million euros for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wants Parliament to take a news of university law.
If it should be sufficient for a single review for the end of a carrying model.
Configuration of the career should be made more flexible, and the recognition of assessments at other universities is also wanted to be ensured and facilitate access to Master.
Until the end of the next year, all careers about their "studyability" are intended to be examined.
On Thursday, the government and opposition discussed again the conditions for study in the Federated State.
In addition to the skills, there were also critical decisions.
In the joint directive at the federal level of the University Groups Juso (Young Socialists), it sees that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be carried out "after closed doors" of the ministers and university directors.
Later after education's springs, students now as major involucrates should also be able to view.
The President of the College Director Assembly (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, supported students: "We need the experience of the students," said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which HRK decided on a common reform document.
For the University of Education and Science (GEW) Bonn's agreements were not enough: the syndicate requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor the possibility to a later Master career.
Furthermore, federal states have to ensure that for the present generation of Bachelor students there are in a future enough study places for Master with the best possible studie conditions.
Federated States have a lot more teachers.
But about a greater access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not make comments.
More than a feet note about Herta Mıer
"Income and exit from Germany is almost done without control" says the first line of a poema of the Lire Werner Sîner in unbalanced language fragments, in which the experiences of arrival to Germany lived by a disident, who won its freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Sōner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked at the beginning as a German and English teacher in Bucarest, and then as a reader in an editorial of infant books before he moved to Frankfurt in 1982.
In 1993, Sõner gave him several premiums, he provided the memorable lessons or conversations of poetry in Frankfurt at the University of Goethe, and since 2002 he is director of the Forum in Hesse in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
God who talks very much last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "Germany Literature in Romania in the speech and the deformed speech of his security documents"
Visiblely unsecure and confused, Sõner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Roman secret service Security against German-Romanian writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In combination with some of the presents in 1989, Sõner had received the German Price from the language.
Recluding attempts had started slowly at the beginning of 1971.
"This is why I am someone who has not been adequately defended against the intentions of provoking security fear," finali · Sʹner.
The warrior Werner Sōner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time of the concession of the Nobel premium to Herta Mıer and its literary polymy with the dictatorial dominion mechanisms, the literary scene is covered and, in particular, the community of German authors originating in Romania for a case that shows the abismos and the wickedness of a political system, based on control and spionage.
Werner Sōner is, so it is known to now, not only is the author but also the victim.
In his record of Safety IM Walter had played a role, scientist Michael Markel said after the confession of Sōner, and he highlighted the influence for him positive of the Walter IM.
He had apologized or defended it at all difficult points for him, said Markel.
"I feel the moral need to do this," he said.
The statement of Sõner in this way and in front of this public was unexpected, however, the confession of an ex-dissident and his work with the Roman secret service does not surprise so much.
Germany would have been a comfortable resource for spies of the Safety-Spitzel had been, wrote Herta Mıer already in July in the weekend "Time", after having read its own 914 pages document.
The involucrates will certainly have speculated and in some cases have known what names were hidden behind Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to the revision of Stasi documents with a procedure controlled in Germany, the treatment with security control documents is still very difused.
A systematic statement has been seen boicoted and difficult in the past years.
A national advice for the clarification of the Security Records (CNSAS), related to Birthler authority, was formulated in 1999, and the delivery of the documents since then has been best added to traces.
Since 2005, there is a law regulating the administration of documents.
An interview, after the concession of Nobel's premium to Herta Mıer, proved that the influence of ancient Security members in Romania is still very large. In this interview, an ex-Chefe of the Security of Temevar spoke desperately of the condecorated.
"He has psychosis," at the end they asked her only once.
The inflammation of power seemed to be shown without returns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the case Sõner, as many times when there are silent faults.
Why right now? Who was caused to be harmful? The quiet reaction of the listeners against the confession of Sõner is expecting that the continuation of this story will be more governed by the concerns of knowledge, not so by the adjudication of faults and by the view of view.
For the genesis of Herta Mıer's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel's prize, it is more than a simple note at the feet.
The Campeons Liga as a garnition to fill the stomach
When the new trainer of the Futball VfB team of Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied with a color plastic ball of the provider of his team, a Mercedes taxi of the C a fourth hour after the middle of the night, he impressed that a member of the elegantly clothed service would be out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports article manufacturer would have distributed samples.
The man of calva characteristics had contracted a chopper, because he did not know the city yet.
Moreover, he could also drive the car himself: for the end, there was no alcohol in the game, and he wasn't born of joy to the 55-year-old man.
It was a pleasant wheel, but tomorrow it would start again.
I'd start it for the first time.
In words of his own, which had been taken only three days ago: "It's true that we are reaching the eights of the end," namely, in the Campeons Liga, thanks to triumph 3:1 against Urziceni, Romania, "but we can't let us blind for success: we'll have to fight brutally against the decline."
The "much more important task" expected them on Sunday next, he disappointed.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real class" in the daily liga.
And remove the weaknesses, which have been clearly evident again, after the fast three goles of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sort
The final eighth of the Campeons Liga (parties from ida on 16/17 and 23/24 of February/flight parties 9/10 and 16/17 of March) shall be sorted on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy was limited by the flaming entrance of the Babbel successor.
Not only in the suspect salvation, who had soon inspired the unconcerned professes of Stuttgart trust in themselves, prepared to deliver and enjoy the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strong points, I insisted on them to be more launched, explained the Gross resource of their success reception that sounds so simple, but that with the Babbel therapy had no effect anymore.
He spread a certain magic, accepted Babbel's party, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse arose in the football, sometimes happen things that wouldn't have believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a pause of several weeks due to an avan-in-law until he becomes the best local player thanks to his dynamic, tried to describe the "fenomen" perceived with the proverb "fresh wind" and the way to work by the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes in the background, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the present situation."
And this was what I had missed, obviously, when Babbel was.
VfB Stuttgart hasn't been tested yet, warn the Sport Director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more than all constants.
Like Gross, the players and the administrator also abstained from overvaluing the triumph against a weak defence for the lack of relief and completely overwhelmed from the Roman guests.
They also had won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had arrived the sad wake up, Khedira thought.
And Director Horst Heldt warned that although a season objective had been achieved, the other was still very far.
We haven't overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt was not pleased to celebrate at his birthday number 40, even after the first victory at his seat from three months ago, he was due to the end of the week, which had been updated again in the form of a television interview, transmitted just before the start of the game, which had granted the portfolio Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that take others, and not Jens, Heldt's hard criticism of Lehmann.
This had reproached deficiency in the direction of the direct advice, which had decided to change a trainer by the pressure of adolescent fanatics.
Also that it would have removed his free day after the games, Lehmann qualified it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "mars for pure egoism," he rejected Heldt, and announced consequences for the last.
Probe you will no longer be friends forever, both quarters.
But at least they agreed with all others in that, without the previous efforts to the team of the substituted trainer, the spectacle of great force of game and battle would not have been possible.
Babbel and its assistants had "a major participation in success," they said Heldt and Lehmann to the unit; and he also agreed with the man of the plastic male.
Peace of the world campaign of heavy weight
Burning fear in Berna: Once and again, the Rector Kevin Johnsonn was providing the world campaign Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his weight title in the WBC version.
The judgment of the judges was unnecessary.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko is still a worldwide weight campaign.
The 38-year-old campaign in the version of the WBC association wined on Wednesday night on Saturday in Berna to e日 Kevin Johnson by single decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko was its third successful defense of the title since its return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already two times a global campaign of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it could not be performed the nock that everyone had expected.
Klitschko extended his balance to 39 triunphs in 41 professional fights, two times he had to be overcome due to his disappointments.
Rector Johnson had to accept the first wound in his fight number 24.
Before approximately 17000 spectators in the Berna Arena, Klitschko, with a 2.02 meter station, he wanted to dictate the battle above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, which before the pleasure had announced the end of Klitschko's era, was squiring once and again from the world's campaign's golp, so Klitschko could not lead its dangerous right target.
In general, the passive Johnson did too little for a retractor, and just tried to pass the rounds.
Although he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his golps only rarely reached the world campaign.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the battle, the retractor had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "terrible zombies" that "he can't do anything."
When weighted, the campaign was allowed to provoke on Friday to remove Johnson's sunsets from the nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth triunph after Klitschko's return
Also in its fourth fight after its return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained inventory.
After a pause of almost four years, he wined the nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his "su" circle from the WBC, which had to be delivered before without fighting.
That year later, Joan Carlos Gomez, from Cuba, and in September Chris Arreola, of the United States.
In this battle I only received a hit, and I'm very good with physically, Klitschko explained his quick return to the ring.
But your dream is still gathering all four important titles in your family.
Your brother Vladimir is a global campaign of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the cinture belongs to the British David Haye, after this destruction in November to Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 metres of stage.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
The company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the Wembley Station of London.
The case Kunduz
The front attack of the opposition: the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Defence Minister, Gutenberg, as a result of information about Kunduz.
The SPD and the isysys require an explanation to the canciller.
Hamburg/Berlin – After the most recent revelations on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition has reproached the Defence Minister, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), having misguided with reasoning.
In the "Tagesschau" news issue of the Sabbath, transmitted by the ARD TV channel, the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "the sciences didn't say the truth" about the death bombing of two convoyes.
In such a case, usually it is said, he said lies.
The killing order would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Group for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, which Mr. Gutenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it had been known that in this attack it was not only to destroy the sequestrated trucks but also to kill two Taliban leaders intentionally.
In the air attack of the United States, requested by the German Commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, in accordance with the NATO investigation report, they died or were disappointed up to 142 persons.
The Green, the SPD and the left moved the Sunday to the Federal Angela Merkel Cancer (CDU) to speak immediately before the Federal Parliament and to explain what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs. Merkel must declare whether an intentional murder strategy is part of the federal government policy of Afghanistan, and if cancery, armies and information services have adopted this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and its colleague of the Green Renate Künast.
Ulrich Wilhelm, the Government's carrier, is determined to criticize.
The cancer had no influence on the concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, said.
The Sabbath had also made doubts on the presentation of the Minister on the reasons for the exemption of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the State Secretary Peter Wichert.
The SPIEGEL information has been provided, both of them had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the convoy attack.
Officially it was said that they had refused the existence of NATO reports and had hidden details to the Minister.
However, from the surrounding of the two high-range officers, they had even indicated to the Defence Minister the existence of several reports, including two pages of Colonel Klein, who was at the command, and a report of a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have requested in a letter to clarify the matter, reporting the newspaper "Frankfurter Generaler Sonntags Zeitung".
It hasn't been answered until the moment.
The Ministry was not manifested on Saturday with regard to the reproaches made to him, and it pointed out that this would be stated in the Federal Parliament's Research Committee, which will be made next Wednesday.
Unirical Worlds
In surveillance state, some people see pictures and hear voices that others don't see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental and drug-dicts, the limits between imagination and reality are disappeared.
As it happens during the dream, everything's fine.
When we are in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can deliver ourselves without work to the most wild imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, who experiments similar states to dream during the watch, or watch and hear things that others don't see or hear, most times in the modern west world are considered as crazy or drugdict, or at least as manic.
But such images and voices are not only in mental or drugs.
The fault has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, painting tables or writing news, sometimes make the limits between dream, foolishness and reality.
The warning states of one-modified conscience can appear in the most different ways, in the best of the cases we call them visions, and in the worst, foolishness.
Although decadenants and effects can be distinguished, processes like the visions of the mystery of Hildegard von Bingen, the psychodelic experiences of the Prophet of the New Castañeda Carlos, the states of chemical possession, and psychosis and hallucinations can be transmitted.
Halucinations or deliries occur when the balance of neuronal communications substances in the brain has been discovered – over all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonine and acetylcoline – and interaction between various parts of it is disturbed.
Severely often a squizophrenic psychosis appears complete hallucinations and inflammated thoughts.
Severity has no power over him anymore
The relationship between foolishness and dream has been occupied with philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristoteles designed hallucinations as a form of dream in the state of watch, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatricity, in 1861 found a "great similarity of the state of crazy with the unirical states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the disappointments, all allocated formations, and spies of this".
It's the 2001 hour when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Your body is of two dimensions and scandally colored.
Severity has no power over him anymore, it's flirting near the rock of the room.
He feels a bitch.
After him, figures of demons with wings, with red mouths like blood, deforms, refining the teeth.
They're pursuing it, pating it with heavy and flaming boats, throwing it up against the walls, he feels pains throughout the body.
Strengthing and malignant items are from the walls and radio.
He can't support them anymore, the voices that insult him and hurt him.
Henning T. throws two cables from the stereo, the worms to form an ahorcade nud, and fixes them in a hang in the thickness.
It gets up in a bottle and puts the nud around the neck.
Skip.
The yard is swimming.
What a lesson it uses to you!, the voices in a coron that turns the timans back to him, "Go to the clinic and make them cure you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first about 20 years ago.
The cause he produced it was the LSD.
His diagnostic is psychosis squizo-afective-paranoid, is also maniaco-depressive, takes drugs, against depression, mania, esquizofrenia.
He has lived with his sickness, he's married three years ago.
In psychosis, I have experienced the most terrible and deepest distress, says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls at least once in the life of skizofrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In an aggressive squizophrenic psychosis, most of the times the affected people are no longer able to distinguish between the outer world and the inside, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, magnitude deliries, distortions in the relationship, or persecution.
Specially extended is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
It is also often optical hallucinations.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish the importance of what it is not, the brain can no longer filter the signals of disturbance, consciousness is seen inappropriately.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens computes to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Catedric Thomas Fuchs, a doctor of the general psychiatric clinic of the University Hospital in Heidelberg.
The squizophrenic is located in the center of the acoustics, everything has a meaning towards him.
At the same time, it comes into a passive role, such as in a dream, it feels abrupt by the attitudes and can't organize them actively.
That is why the squizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, to wake up, impossible.
Have experienced a hallucination once in life
In contrast to in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensoral reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as."
Paranoic thoughts and hallucinations are in reality supported, the distance of experience is in reality.
For researchers is still an unknown reason why our brain makes cabriols.
See Fuchs, the states of opposition can bring any person to contact with the reality temporarily.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
It seems that there is a genetic provision for squizophrenia, but studies in them have shown that there are also other determining factors in addition to genes.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimum brain damage.
We assume that the neurological maturity of the brain is affected in a early stadium of development, such as ≥ a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it is still an uncognite way that change in the neuron system is produced, which is also not absolutely shown for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays a significant role – stress or traumatic experience can be the detonants of a psychosis when there is already a previous provision.
Similarly, alucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, because they interfere with the brain transmission system.
When the brain is heated
The illogic thing of all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very dear medicines to be released from them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says the cathedral in psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as a pleasant or not often depends on the viewpoint.
Kasten collected reports on hallucinations and visions since ten years and analysed the results of the book Die irreale World in our Head (The Inreal World in our head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms of psychosis accompanied, but also, often, of many other diseases.
Among them, with psychical distortions such as the deterioration of personality or depression, are also often diseases such as ́na, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer and craneoencephalic traumatisms.
in surprising way and in certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, ifever Kasten, consist of memories that usually are repressed.
They survive when the brain areas where sensoral perceptions are processed are hyperactive or low cohibed; when our brain is heated, but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can cause this state as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimulus, stress, loving or other brain states.
In younger ones, it has given up to one third of the questionnaires to have at least once in life a Halluzination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, lived in a small city of Mecklenburg-Pomerania O’al and attended a secondary education college.
A running girl.
If it wasn't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during the recreation, a boy gets a long and dark hair.
When she answers her, the other students look at her understood; no one, besides her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the tired girl is a little strange lesson, but Sarah K. She knows she's not dreaming.
She's wake up and looking and listening to that boy, as she looks and listens to the girl sitting on the side side.
You can even feel your presence, at least some instants.
It's a pleasant feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes you wonder if you're crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
For nights, appearances are alarming.
Views are often a load.
When he is in class sometimes can't follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while the rest explains the matematic equations in a way and audible way.
For nights, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room that the dream comes, which often comes late and is short, he doesn't know if he is awake or dreaming, if the images that see, the muckles or girl with bloody shots in his arms and legs, appear in front of their open or closed eyes.
Leave me in peace, call them to the figures.
You didn't tell your parents and friends anything, they would think she's crazy.
Otonio 2009. Sarah K. He's 20 years old today.
He adopted the last year selectiveness and lived with his boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations have disappeared.
Since you've entered Internet contact with the Kasten psychologist, you know it's not crazy.
False is also a work of art for desperation.
See Kasten, when a person is here socially or suffers a restriction of stimulus, it is very difficult that after a time, he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and it is the same to seek entertainment.
Sarah K., a single daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at 13 years of age, he learned that the man who calls Dad since he has used the reason is not his biological father.
"Every experience," says Kasten, "is in the brain, the real real and sound is projected there. "It is hard to distinguish between visions and reality.
The hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not distinguishing in the main of those of an aggressive psychosis.
In contrast to the squizophrenics, psychically healthy people are to recognize their visions as irreal.
Kasten recommends that your patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special happiness.
Limitation between dream and hallucination
In this world too focused on consciousness, imaginary experiences are generally patological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Cathedral in Heidelberg and Chief of the Psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic of Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but also causes something positive and creative – foolishness is a work of art of desperateness.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the called honirism, a special form of consciousness, which is felt as if it was a dream.
Honorary hallucinations are almost very filled and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that later cannot distinguish from being awakened.
Oniric conscious states arise extremely related to a trauma or a disease, such as patients with polyrradiculoneeuropatia, who experience a motor paralysis completely conscious. Die bei full Bewusstsein a motorische Lähmung learn.
It is Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of one or the world due to a total and permanent motor incapacity, this substitutes a very dangerous real situation by a own and imaginary world that is disappointed from the reality.
A form of limited situation between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change is produced, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving sense and interpretation to an inappropriate situation in itself that our own creation capacity allows us to do nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Peter Cornelius’s artist also describes his honourable experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a action of human salvation.
He was 49 years old when his consciousness was shiped in several days after a cardiac vault operating with heart transplant, while his body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
There was a world that was created by him and visited strange places of other times:seeing sealed in the bed, a greater guy on the board of a sanatorium in a train, a robot watched for his health.
He was seen in the high Medium Age, around nobles that produced drugs from blood.
A Greek on a motor dropped him in his country of origin, surfed his hospital bed in the Alpes with snow snow and met a mafia Korean.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For you, these internal travels are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, describes your experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental travels are, many years later, much more clear, even in the unrelevant details.
Clearer and intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the time of the rest of our daily experiences, adds the psychiater Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, honirism, psychosis, hallucinations and consumption of drugs shows the fragility that is the internal reproduction of the outer reality, even when we are wake up.
Each change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the physician Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call real."
A experience that, on the other hand, can be fully enriched.
Snow can come
Burda
Children will be responsible for the editorial for 27 years
The new editor Kallen has reached a temporary solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in hands of his two children, commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – The Hubert Burda editor sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become 27-year-old inheritants and are firmly willing to enter the company, confirmed Burda, 69-year-old, to SPIEGEL.
The details have been adjusted as a precautionary measure.
The following question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are for that.
One can't put 7.500 workers in front of their children, if they are not enough for it.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda met on Thursday that will be removed from January from the Presidency of the Joint Directive and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed by his follower.
This member of the Kallen family is 52 since 1999 member of Burda's address.
At the beginning, he was responsible for technology.
Later, he was responsible for the treasury and thereafter reached the responsibility for the company's possession. After Jürgen Todenhaver's outcome, he also was charged with direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family takes care of the editorial.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who now was 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to, "saving the differences of 10, 15 years", says Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With the view of the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffle, Burda showed that family companies are not also in the abstention: "This has always affected families who are allowed to be concerned about the capital search, which have been condemned wrongly and thought they could rise as well as the largest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I've never had "ground deliries", Burda.
I don't seem as a political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world liga; these businesses have been made too big.
Integral Beauty
Everything - in the matter of beauty and welfare - you can wish at the reach of your hand.
This is what it seems to have been proposed The English Court, which just insulted in the commercial centre of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mimo of the body.
The spa, held in the eighth plant, counted with prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - which is responsible for the laser depilation-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and steady treatments; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or, which has a gimnasio, or L'O'tane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a section of food, where the tethry is highlighted, with more than 130 different classes than this infusion.
enjoy a relaxing massage with your couple while looking at the incredible views of the capital, or getting the relax area for two hours to mount your own "beauty party" with eight of your friends and relaxing with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a copy of champagne are some of the possibilities that provide Spaxion.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and more new face-, body- and therapy treatments.
Like, for example, the cavitation to fight celllitis or vibratory platforms.
The gimnasio also relates to these machines, as well as with a "trensors" who guide customers' steps, offering them a completely customized treatment.
Everything begins by introducing your personal key on a tactyl screen, faced with the machine.
So several videos show us how to perform our exercise table correctly.
Your director assures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching) are enough to exercise all the body muscles.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to pass through the peluquery, the signature Luis & Tachi has a room where hair recovery rituals are offered in a customized way.
Innovation and employment seem to have been the premises of this city spa, which will be opened every day of the year, from 10:00 of the morning to 22:00 of the night.
Miscellaneous
It is near Christmas and it is never more to consider the looks of the stars to adapt them to our festival clothes.
The form of listening, very important to highlight the silute, is one of the variables we should take into account.
There are a few suggestions.
The song Fergie chose a very complicated and excited speech. It's not very advisable.
Endsa and Barcelona, with the car
The end-track company, together with the Barcelona Assembly, has created the 'Live Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote vehicles in the Catalan capital.
The 'Live Office ' (Logistic for the Implanting of the Vehicle El ́trico) will define and coordinate the road sheet for the implanting of the car and will reach mobility agreements, management, coordinating, presenting subventions, etc.
On the other hand, the project MOVELE will develop, promote the car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, it is intended to impulse what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Citizens'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implanting of the car the ́thric in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla are subject to the project.
They are the three cities selected by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to impulse the vehicle's implantation.
The enterprise ends has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalogue Generality.
It is therefore intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Catalogue Autonomous Community.
Among these would be the activities linked to energy, in particular to energy.
It is not the only initiative in which it is finally involved in the promotion of the vehicle's trailer.
The company participates in European standardisation groups and has a series of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT Verde.
Zapatero comes 'a quiet hour' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, appears "a quiet hour" for the Spanish car industry, which, recalled, is the main exporting sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Information of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has implemented throughout the exercise to support the car sector.
"Unless the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, we would have a delay panorama today, to close some of our main productive plants," said the President of the Government.
"Gracies to this plan and to the following marks in Spain, in a very high sector, we can have a quiet hour for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integral Automotive Plan (IPA), assigned 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 assistant companies, which mobilized a investment of over 3,000 million euros.
The Executive Boss explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized the governmental measures to support the request, in appeal to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and carmarks.
The President, this plan has allowed a 6% reduction of the average marketing of new vehicles on the Spanish market and has promoted a "fortful increase" of the matriculations, which increased "a 40%" in November.
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first and first of the International Room of the Classic Vehicle will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and affairs of the Mount of the Engine.
This initiative will be developed during 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Cristal Pabellon of the Campo de Madrid House.
It is an ex-official surface of 200,000 square metres in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only classic motorcycles and cars can be found, but in ClassicAuto Madrid will be found articles of any kind related to the engine world.
Thus, among the former packaging accessories, exchanges, components, textile accessories, plugins, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will make the delights of collectionists and curious.
Among the participating companies, including Mos and Good Old Times, will be selling cars; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sales and car restoration; or Classical Cochera, Mercedes Benz specialist.
External ability tests
Furthermore, the trade activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: celebration of concentrations, sport exhibitions, ability tests, presentations and concurrences.
The ability tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out in a circuit that is able outside the ferial road.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sport
Mazda wants to demonstrate that sport is not renewed with respect for the environment.
Therefore, just inserted in Mazda3 the engine stop and start - baptized as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horse.
This second generation of Mazda3 highlights the good note achieved in all its.
The ends, the end of the vehicle, the habitation, the behaviour, the mechanical, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are supersalent in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving place, we check that the front bottles present a excellent ergonomia and submission.
Also, the tact of the volant is exquisite.
Following the total form of the instrument table and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend to create a future internal design, with a large number of buttons and commands and calling colors in red and a.
This style, in part, refers to us, which also is presented by the Honda Civic.
So we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, are contrary to the subsequence of the German products, and in particular the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to fight.
With the habit, this Japanese compact provides more than enough habitation for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All of this is summed a wide maleter and regularly.
The engine's auto-stop and starting system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-liters gasoline engine and 150 horses and with the manual shift of six walks.
This engine is an authentic delicity. Sursal for its finger, for its reduced soundness, for the performances and for the achievement of consumption contains.
And it is that although the most requested Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not perform a high number of kilometers per year should not remove this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both by their high comfort of walking and for their consumption.
In respect of the equipment level, the selected version for the test is the name Sportive, which includes a larger number of series elements.
From the series equipment, especially the carrier exchange assistant (RVM) who removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive internal speech, board computer in a large size screen, parking sensors, independent climate sensor, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17 pounds of alignment.
Furthermore, if it was shortly your equipment, this version included the Pack Premium, which adds EUR 1.500: bixenon adaptives and BOSE sound system with disk loader, including other elements.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts of the category.
It is particularly highlighted by the quality of the materials employed, by their behavior and by the high level of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not perform a lot of kilometers per year will be able to choose by this i-Stop version, only associated with the gasoline engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only income of this model is its high price, which is located between the 21.770 euros of the Luxury end and the 23.270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
By changing this high number, Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
Lujo 'Primeira'
L. A. covers the red lamp of freedom of the hand of Penélope, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars lighted more than ever in the models such elegant as 'sexys' at the edge of 'Nine'. (Fotos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', so sophisticated as usually, chose by a dark 'lady'.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without a chance if you see some kind of attachments or navigate through the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when the Time magazine appointed him one of the products of the year.
To see it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
In contrast to smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low amount of men, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the iPhone data plan.
Since the company has succeeded, the company has taken two new devices: one thought for Twitter, the other with a free life data service instead of paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday in Le Web event, is the European version of invent and its third encarnation.
It's equal to limited as its contrapartition and .. but it comes with a surprise.
The maintenance price of approximately 12 euros per month includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what to refuse the data when the border is crossed or unexpectedly search for a WiFi cafeteria (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of a fixed roaming is incrediblely attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operations have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience, a physical doctor needs to understand them and a good hair to read the little letter.
The repeated ear tirons of the European Commission to achieve adequate roaming tariff for all Europe have only had a perceived effect.
Outside the country of origin, there is fear of using data, and rightly.
Let a device like FonPeek (not stop being interesting that takes the name of Fon when you do not have Wifi) gets this type of tariff means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortise their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book trading and other consultations on the Internet.
No contracts and no gates.
It's a connected device and it's paid for it by buying it, not monthly.
And that's what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a bought option with life access like that Peek already has in the United States.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope it's because I think it's a more fair model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's fatic color
The yellow is, of course, the preferred tone of the first lady and.
If you have already arrived to Barack Obama's property as a president of the United States with a clothes and a cover of this color, you have chosen the same to join you in the second important moment of your life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Price of Peace.
Michelle Obama has taken a very similar model at the same time: besides being a similar - green-amarillo with reflectors-, the acting was two times composed of three pieces - dressed, jacket and covered the same screen, and was adornated with a great border or .
That's how, in a first view, it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the star of the Princess of Asturia and had chosen to repeat clothing.
But the screen in which the two carries are confectionated makes them very different.
If for the acquisition of a fat encampment, Oslo is a tree with printing.
The plugins have also varied: green hairs of medium tacton again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And it is also different: a collection at this occasion, melena switchs the previous.
75% of the mother's work has had job problems for their maternity
Discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This shows that the study of the "Fecundity and Training of Women in Spain", established by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The investigation between 9.737 women from 15 to 75 years of age does not doubt: 75 per cent of the mothers have seen limited opportunities in the work area due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences at the beginning of the couple's withdrawal and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the house, work partly, or have an unstable job, start first with a couple, progress the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with sustainable employment, mainly in the public sector, are delayed with maternity and have less offspring.
"The women between 35 and 49 years of fixed work have the first child, average, 3.7 years after starting with employment, which increases to 4.1 women with strict jobs have needed more time of their vital traictory to achieve them, which has led them to put up the union and arrival of children.
Furthermore, the type of work exercises a lot of influence on maternity even less on the packaging calendar," explains CSIC Margarita Delgado research.
The level of studies is one of the factors that distinguish the age of women when married and having the first wedding.
The survey is, how older the educational level is, the age to which they are married and the first child.
The difference is also maintained between women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who have elemental and higher studies have been mothers for the first time from 25.1 to 32.1 respectively.
"There is also set out another division between women depending on their study level.
While those who have elemental studies are married and have their first child before getting a stable job, the average or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stability work as before the marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado states.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to his enlightened ambassador list: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actriz will be converted into a picture of different products of the mark, showing the universal lema of 'Because I love it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Christle', one of the most elegant acteurs of the international panorama, is one of the other famous figures of the Oreal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spain Penélope.
Before it, the latest incoming in such a select club were the Evangeline Lilly ('Fromidos') and Frida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male paragraph, the cosmetic mark also relates to luxe ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomia de Grey') and Matthew Fox (committee of Evangeline in 'Laughter').
British Mode Premies
Britains have a lot to say in the world of mode.
His highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - gathered together in the annual delivery of their premiums, which was celebrated in London, the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed at the meeting.
The former Jerry Hall model and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent Poker
Manuel Vicent gives a thirteenth of the radiographs of writers who have passed through their literary life (and, in cases, also by the other).
He doesn't do it in the pre- and fearful genres (biografic appearance, life and work), but seeking something similar to the ignition nuclear of the creator character.
The journey has its excitings and Vicent does not disturb suits or illusions.
Besides a pleasant pleasure, the book is a conmove · invitation to reading and reading.
Here I leave you some instantanes.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulsation, the same thing I felt without giving him a name: the pleasure against the acetic destination, the moral without fault and the innocentness without no god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, a happy Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellectual, between impotence and ignorance, with a delightful poetical humor, without meaning, like the sheet of the neck that he was going to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that endured thirty years, in which the meat joined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege consisting of reaching heaven to the path of perfection."
About James Joyce: "The "Ulises" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meters cimes of the universal, which must be scaled by the north wall, from which the best alpinists are once and again."
About William Faulkner, "It was a strange guy.
At the same time, he said that he was inherited by a territory of the condeal and others who were a son of a black and a cocodril.
Both dreams were great."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the cry from a bridge from that Munich character to take his echo to the bottom of the 20th century under his literary form and made it in a traveling from himself and calling to posterity with a violent speech to the guyanes."
About Dorothy Parker: "Every day he put his knees and repeated: 'God dear, I beg you to stop writing as a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tube, these verses of Spenser were held: "The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the gate,/ the rest after the war,/ after the hard life enjoys death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the team he also brought his depressions.
The husband accepted normally that she told her that Eduardo VII spyed her between the azalees or that the birds sang in Greek.
The case of such a patient and loving man has never been given to a neurotic whose literary talent went before his foolishness."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do but try to inocular Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try to get Baroja through Faulkner's weapons?
What did this do but abduct the fame of that man to serve him as a pedestal?"
Cobard Agression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother passed by our apartment in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of 15-18-year-old youths passed with her and our dog, an exemplary of massive race, rescued from the dog and with no more than six kilograms of weight, and, without meaning, two baths that left the evil dog.
Our indignation is great because we haven't found entertainment in a free attack to a small and undefensive animal, which was truly attached.
This must be added the summon that caused a lady that passed quietly and that, when he invoked these individuals, she came to fear for her physical integrity, because an energy that attacks a animal is able to do itself with a woman, a child, an elder, or, finally, with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The event occurred at the five of the afternoon of a Tuesday everyone by a traditionally quiet village.
The dog was crying all day.
Indeed, we made a complaint in a nearby Commissioner that we doubted that it served for a lot and not to generate sensitivity, just claiming that the murderers were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denunciate this fact.
We don't understand that it's happening among young people so that they're considered fun to deal freely with an undefensive animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We don't know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the cow
Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Vial Security Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the cask, mainly among the younger engineers, reported both today.
This initiative seeks to conscious the importance of use of the cask, since it is the only element of protection that can avoid disappointments in the head or, even, death in the case of a accident while it is in motorcycle.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was part of its commitment with travel security, that "is going beyond design and manufacture of more safe products every day" and suggested that it also contributes to this objective through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign of promotion of the use of the casco in the motorcycle, under the lema 'To be or not to be', will have a first stage in which cards will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycles, with a view to reaching the maximum diffusion.
To end, Michelin highlighted that vial security "is a constant concern" for the company, since when being a two-road vehicle manufacturer, one of its main purposes is developing more safe products.
Up to the sale of light trades
Nearly two years later, the market of light commercial vehicles begins to see something light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 units which were registered in November in Spain represented an increase of 12.6 per cent in 2008 and, most importantly, the first increase after 22 months of decreases is represented by the patronal numbers of Anfac manufacturers and the Ganvam sellers.
The good data, not you, should be put in quarantine because the reference to which the comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% in respect of the previous year.
Consequently, despite the recurrence of the last month, the registrations collected in these 11 months are 40% under the previous exercise.
Since January, 95.853 units have been sold all vehicles consisting of the saster chain of light trades: tourists derivatives, pick up, furniture, light cars and light trucks/case.
Furthermore, the nubarrons who are more affected by their request have not disappeared because, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay nearly 100% of external financing cases.
Thus, the restrictions under the closed grif of credits must include other factors such as increase in pause levels or persistence of the bad economic situation.
Before this panorama and in contrast to tourisms, they have soon served assistance for the purchase of 2000E.
In addition to individuals, autonomes and pymes that are going to buy a light trade of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 ions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been testified.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they again remembered the need to give special attention to these vehicles and to industrial vehicles (carriers and buses).
The sales association pronounces a 2010 compared to the end year, which calculates a fall in sales (turism and 4x4) of 19%.
Aid to the emergency frenade is already mandatory
Like the ABS locking anti-blocks and the ESP Stability Control, the emergency breeding aid systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, it is already in all light commercial tourisms and vehicles of new registration, while for the rest a shortage period is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, introduced by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of peatons, even though, by their way of work, can also help to avoid many collisions at a time.
The assistant to the emergency frenade is to increase the pressure on the breasts in case of a emergency, which the system detects by the driver's bathroom.
But this does not always keep that pressure until the end.
A study carried out by the Bosch car manufacturer, the third part of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to steal the brain before the collision and half of them did not use the whole force.
Until 1.100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, however, requires the maximum frenade system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
A study of the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, could be avoided by the year up to 1.100 mortal accidents in which peatons are involved.
The reduction will be even greater - it will be calculated that one of the four injuries would be avoided with damage to people - when the called intellectual brain systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles and warns the driver, as well as easily acts on the frens.
If the driver reverses, helps you increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not repeat, and even though the collision is inevitable, the device does the maximum effort to minimise damage.
General Motors delayed the plan for Opel until January
While the workers of Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will be started in the first week of April - on 8th, probably - informs Javier Ortega, the manufacturer, and warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, intends is that each of the points of the plan has been previously consensuated by the parties concerned.
And this can make the final document that will be subject to the first and afterwards to the Governments of the countries in which there are factors, delay until the beginning of 2010.
However, from GM it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be taken in the next days.
This is not strange that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the manufacturer and is to make a decision as soon as before.
GM admit to contact some new possible buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also encourages to purchase Volvo, but covers the option of the Netherlands Sporting Car manufacturer of Skyper, which is supported by the Russian Group Converg.
In the case that I had not agreed with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to China Baic.
The decision to close Saab for the end of the year is maintained if it is not sold.
At the Porsche Boxster Spyder flight
To develop its last, and joyfully, Porsche's engineers took the Boxster S as a base and achieved that it was no less than 80 kg, which left the base in only ≥75 kg.
This led them first to prevend from the automotive weight that was supplied by one of the lone with manual ≥ 21 kg; using aluminium gates like the GT3, 'caen' other 15; removeing the climatiser, 13; reducing the fuel depth from 64 to 54 litres, they wined 7 kilograms more; mounting sports ≤ 12 and with 19 pounds light, 5 pounds.
Finally, rejecting the CDR-30 audio system has offered six other kilograms and changing the gates' towers by one screen, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the double embrage PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with six speed manual box, mainly by secondary routes in California, in mountain traces with actually revised traces
Your behavior can only be qualified of intakable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car does not weigh the asfalt with aploom.
Instead, all the contrary: it was time that we did not test a model so small and light that at the same time it would translate so much security in the step by curve, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete, able to heat his muscles in a short walk during the time necessary, until we order him to print, to frene, to recover and again express his engine...
What we ask you, thanks to your address, as communicative as necessary, what we indicate with our hands on the floor is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with a chirurgical precision.

The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very achieved and can be powered with the "sport" option and ≥ a system that changes the engine brammy, already stretched in the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, either from stop or in recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asfalt of the roads we passed through with the Boxster Spyder was very punished, but the car was worth the bags.
Electronic aid only made presentation in all the traject; and that we found in some of the curves ice on sunset and greenhouse, both in the morning.
Finally, an ultraleger car, of the most funny drive that one can on the market and that is something more than a simple change of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, with a price of EUR 70.831.

Basconium is given a victory in Israel
The Laboral Box reached a triumphant for 82-91 in his visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra canch, despite the numerous lows with which the Dusko Ivanovic team was counted, and in this way it was situated in the leadership of its group, after the great action of Mirza Teletovic, which with eight triple noted was the best of its team (29 of assessment).
The victory team suspected to supplie the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Guertas or Micov with large doses of implication and collective work, even though he had to suffer until the end to do with the victory.
Moreover, the big acid from the perimeter, with 16 triple noted, had much to see in the final triumph.
The party eats from face to agrogranes, which have been placed from the beginning in front of the marker.
That the first four of the victorians were from the perimeter, it had already made a preagging that they had gone to the Israeli candle with the warm munchs..
English and Teletovic were the main artists of 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was more than the same, but the Alaves team chose for the inside game of Barak and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with shots and applause in the return to which he was his house, to continue to expand his benefit to rest (34-43).
Teletovic had already started to highlight as the best of his team with 13 points, although the "minor six" valuation of Splitter had already claimed that he would not be the best night in Brazil.
But the party, despite being stuck at the rest, was not determined even much less, and the macabeans wanted to remember the victories who won't any of them in his bed, and with the 'man of Elijah' they were able to get into the party.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'amarillas' to return to the ́so (50-49).
More Inconvenients
The people of Ivanovic, wounded but not less dead, needed to hire a couple of games with acerty to pick air, and in them the ametralla of Mirza Teletovic arrived, which with three nearly consecutive triples and the help of English and Fish returned the marker to a quiet rent (54-67), which could make the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The alavess went out to leave the skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone remove what was deserved for the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team were not resigned and kept their team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite that, and with Splitter eliminated by failures, Ivanovic's people did not predict themselves well, defended, and even though the Israelites approached the final minute (80-85), the party had already owner and the victory was first escape from Tel A's season.
Lesions impide from battle in Unicaja
The Unicaja was extremely lost in Greece before the Olympiacos and gave him the leader of the Group B of the Euroliga, in a party marked by the low of the caaches, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malean team was not afraid of the environment of the Package and Amistad pavilion and also of the rival, perhaps of the most powerful Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed you to dream the andaluces. A aggressive defense and three three consecutive triples, two of the Omar Cook base and one of Guillem Rubio, departed to the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos seemed surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, returned to Marker 22-20, minute 13, when a action, battle conceit, between the two bases and the Beverley and Williams, assumed the decalencing of both players.
The Greek set eats to work by showing his superiority within both areas, where the lowness by the lesion of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal missing of Carlos Jiménez, were lacking the cakes.
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian Learn Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the benefit 44-32, minute 19.
Unable to mount
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, which, despite the 19 losses, was higher and even coming to compare the difference between the meeting disputed in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the leadership of the group to ball.
The Unicaja overlooked the absents and the last low of the Scotch pivot Robert Archibald, lesioned during the meeting.
Despite all inconvenients, the Unicaja for Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left something of hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was almost impossible because the Olympiacs when he applauded and gave its superiority in centimeters inside the area were inconsistent.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, was able to remont the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja disappeared, delivering the leader to Olympiacos.

Brazil sets date at Zelaya output
The Brazilian Government has set a term for Manuel Zelaya's stay in its ambassador in Tegucigalpa.
The Chairman shall leave the diplomatic liaison by 27 January 2010, when its mandate was officially completed.
Francisco Catunda, responsible for Brazil's ambassador's business in the Hungarian capital, confirmed the Globo TV that "Mel" knows that it should go out before that date of the ambassador, where it remains re-served since September 21.
"He has a conscience that he has to go out on January 27, at the end of his mandate, needs to seek another destination."
It also cited the former mandate, who confirmed its intention to exit the ambassador before the appointed term: "My position is to exit as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said via telephone.
After the elections of November 29 (in which the porfirio Lobo election was chosen), Zelaya assured that he would stay in the Brazilian ambassador until January.
However, this same week he tried to find re-eye in Brazil.
The operation finally was distressed by the Zelaya with the political asylum who wanted to impose the "fair" Government of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and rose since the early past, where the inflation of assets has been the dominant tonic on the markets, the uncertainty is again on the markets, which should not be surprised because it is its natural state, in a environment where the agents make decisions on the future by incertain nature.
The medication used by Central Markets to stabilise markets was to monetate debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving free liquidity bar to nearly 0 types so that the financial costs purchased assets to disregard.
The centrals have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically been completed and, without questioning their liquidity policy, they begin to throw some sand in the areas as the ECB did with its summer at the next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain the economic recovery without so-heterodoxa measures, and we are assisting a reversion of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatilities of the Bolsas and the differences in the good corporates have returned to repeat, even though they are very remote from the paranormal levels that have reached at the beginning of the year.
States were obliged to socialize private risks and the public debt returns to the affected verse.
There is a flight to quality again, and the U.S.A., Japan and Germany have been the resource chosen by investors, providing an extension of the differences in the Eurozone countries in relation to Germany.
Spain had only been affected by this instability episode, but in that it reached Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new review to the lower ratification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, something of uncertainty is not wrong to rebuild the defensors of the moral risk that rebuild consciousness on the responsibles of the global economic policy because they have distorted the destructive effects resulting from the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, where it is to decree a new day of thanksgiving action.
However, Dubai pains a tribal fight between the emirates to recompense the power in the emirates and Greece we have already seen before.
A Government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that takes the hand.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It does not mean that the Ecofin will save Hungary from an incomplete of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a Member State of the euro to comply with its commitments.
What is logical is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public funds.
If, as we expect, we meet ourselves before a normalization episode of transitional risk premiums, after some in positions falling, it would be within the expected.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt increase as well as the good European corporates should not be concerned.
If European differences decrease and ours continue to expand, it would be Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
The standard & Poor's is an announcement. When our advanced indicators are forced to the majority of studies to predict their recovery scenarios and to revise their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the load with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, there is no longer a lot of hope of life to their warning.
Again, you have the whole pint that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish actives, even though at the moment "providence, friend conductor".

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday in the subcommission of the Congress of Members in which the energy strategy of Spain is discussed in these days in the next two decies.
After his intervention, which followed the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galan gave the press a few pins of what he had put on the subcommittee to the closed door.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 5 billion euros until 2020 and more 6 billion billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear centres are being opened today.
If not, the necessary investment will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95 million.
Yes, Iberdrola considers that investment should not be intended to increase capacity in generation but in distribution networks and international interconnections
Since 2020, the issue changes and will have to increase power.
It is focused on gas plants and carbon plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, in particular, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that there are 18,000 new MW, that is, yes, with other "support energy".
Galan, who considers that the draft Sustainable Economy Law, which has just adopted the Government, is online with what his company has come to complain, did not want to make blood with the real decree to induce national carbon consumption, which oppose climate change policies.
In its opinion, there is "a clear long-term statement" in this regard, despite "puntual measures", as the President of Iberdrola called them.
Whether or not, Galan considers that investment decisions, despite long-term, should be started to take because they are late in maturity and is needed a stabil recompense framework to overcome them.

Acion disputes with his first autopise inside Hochtief and Bouygues
It fights for its first autopise in concession, the market in which it already works as energy and water manager.
The work in the game is the one of an evaluated tunnel in $1.700 in Australia (approximately $1.047 million).
The French Bouygues and the Hochtief sister are its rivals.

In the hope that their offers will be presented in the next month of May, the planned investment amounts to 1.700 million Australian dollars (1.047 million euros) and at the last stage compenses three consorties with a significant presence of European builders.
The Baptized Group as Transcity is led by Aciona, the only Spanish in liza, and its companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, sitting in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Contrary to the Aciona team, the Northern consortium plays, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French Bouygues Constructor Group.
The third and latest consortium that has passed the grip is the named LBRJV, where they hold capital the Australian Leighton (the branch of the German constructor Hochtief, who was participated by ́S), also the local Baulderstone (the brothers' ownership of the Bilfinger Berger group) and the specialized gala signature in the Razel civil work.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it is a clear income difficulty if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction signature.
A strategy followed by the Hochtief or Bilfinger cited, as well as Asian references, which continues to be adequate assignment for Spanish giants in the sector.
Only S has achieved a position in that market at ≥ 30% of its participation in Hochtief, the property of the Leighton.
Millionary Activities
It focuses on a geographical area of maximum importance for the sector, in which it already presents its activities as energy provider and in the dealing business.

The subterranean peague road, promoted by the Office of Infras of the city of Brisbane and called Northern Link (Northern Link), is called to join the West Coast of Toowong with the circumvalence route in Kelvin Grove (see map) for 5 km of tunnel. It is the greatest action to reduce the congestion in Brisbane trading.
The calendar marked by the Action sets the adjudication for the summer of 2010 and the start of work in December of the next year.
Although this payment step would be opened to the traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel comes to design in 2005.
It will include two carriers per meaning, electronic peaging system and a full ventilation system.

Many of 63 million to France Télécom for competition
The competence regulator in France has imposed a bank of 63 million euros to France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
This institution has limited the competition in fixed and mobile phone with the signing of agreements, price plans and faithfulness programmes to consumers at the border of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopolie and still a state company collected more than 560 million euros in charges since 1994 for putting their competitors in work.
The penalty imposed yesterday has actually been increased because the authority watching the competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is, therefore, repeated.

Playing the Champions has reported 476,4 million to Madrid and Barza from its origin
The Campeons Liga has become a source of income for clubs since he was born in 1992.
So that Real Madrid and Barcelona have income 476,4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that has won more money in competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the EUFA Campeons Liga does not only give glory. It is also one of the main income sources of the major clubs.
That is how the competition has divided 5.362,5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created at the 1992/1993 season, EUFA data are given.
The Real Madrid and the F. C. Barcelona have been well stopped from this department.
The white club has been the third of the continent who has increased money by participating, and the only, with Milan, who has won three times the trophe.
The catalan, the victory campaign and the last winner of the extinct Copa of Europe in 1992, is the fifth of the classification.
The list leads Manchester United and the Bayern of Monich, the two teams that also make more money for the past Liga de Campeones.
And that, despite both front of the Barce.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money to the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, by the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Layout
This paradox appearance is explained by the complicated cash distribution procedure applied by the EUFA.
For this exercise, the agency presiding Michel Platini provides 1.090 million income by the Champions League.
From these money, the EUFA will dedicate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs participated in the pre-classification round (including the Atletic of Madrid) received 2.5 million.
Furthermore, those who were able to participate received 3.8 million only because they were, and more than 550,000 euros for each party.
There are also bonuses to win (800,000 euros) and papa (400,000 for each team). Octavofinalises will receive three million each; eight quarter finalistes, 3.3 million.
The last four will pay 4 million each.
The campaign will win 9 million, in front of the 5.2 million finalists.
Thus, as a conception of strict payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barza, on the other hand, was 2.5 million to win the Supercope of Europe in August.
But it is that there are also the variable payments, which are assigned to 337.8 million.
This money is distributed is the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is of the main, and accounts for four places assigned.
The previous year's campaign remains with 40% of the allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the quarter.
The other part shall be paid to the number of games played in the e of this year.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa group decreased yesterday the details of the purchase of action to purchase a top between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.

The Jeresh group gives a 15-day period to communicate their interest in sale of titles.
The CNMV has not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company had appealed that he had contacted the regulator.
If it was done, the payment would achieve the 611.7 million when Sos capitalization was 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, your address continues to re-react.
In an attempt to stay at the margin of possible purchase offers and of the legal vessels of their former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordan as a director of internal audit.
A decision to make it the first woman who takes a high charge in the food company.
It is a place of new creation that will depend directly on the Chairman of the Group.
And it is not excluded from polemics, since the company continues to be impressed in the legal battle by the assumed deviation of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar society.
In fact, it cannot be dismissed that in the next months, new fund discharges are discovered
With regard to Salazar's credit yesterday, the former consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Norriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) declared in the National Audience and adopted 212 million without knowing their destination.

New tools to perish cars
In these days of time and accidents, they won not only car rentals.
Each day, thousands of cars who have suffered a sinister are lost up to a taller, where a expert must evaluate the damage suffered and what will be the cost of repair.
No signature is equal, and the estimation of the costs of parts and the worktime can be a long and complicated work.
Calculate manually the cost of a repair between 200,000 and 300,000 euros, including work parts, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest informatic tools, the question would be decreased.
Therefore, almost 100% of the experts use this type of systems.
Provider of services and solutions for assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collect information provided by manufacturers, so that they will then develop and offer it to their clients in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American Solera group, is the leader signature; 80% of the assessments are made with their products.

Furthermore, the amount of data to be treated does not stop to increase, until in the last five years there have been launched versions, variants of remotorizations as in the previous fifteen.
As a new car goes on the market, these companies are starting to work.
It is a very heavy work, because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle has to catalogue and introduce its price.
Furthermore, each model makes a "intelligent" graphical image where "pinch" different parts of tourism can be made.
If it is a model of ventamasiva, the work may be ready in a week if the process goes very quickly.
If you are a minor car, you may be in three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information about 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among most models there are information about Porsche, but not from Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As regards the mobile park that you have, they are over 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation and the design of the databases, Audatex has eight world-wide centres (Spania, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific marks.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in preparing these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this huge information flow allows these companies to make different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but there are also tools for the management of destruction parts or to calculate the vence or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide to report on the value of users in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it is in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to make an idea of the type of support they can provide for professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, as the AudaPlus star product, the standard solution for the evaluation of the rating, intended for experts.
It includes low or heavy industrial cars, motors and vehicles.
Besides the cost of the pieces, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or painting bars.
This tool is paid is used for each evaluation.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75, for clients who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
After all, each guaranteed company, which performs thousands of experiences, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it went out of the mounting line only with its bastard number.
AudaGlass is focused on the moons of the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the Internet professional sector that allows you to raise up by the vehicles declared totally.
Your statistics service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemography analysis or to identify diversions by homodell marks.
For example, how many models of a specific mark have passed by the taller because of mistress or how many have suffered serious injury during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Commercialize, inter alia, Gt Stimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.

Four Steps Tax Budget
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user receives a budget in only four steps: identifying the vehicle, searching for recycling, creating budget and generating budget.
Easy to use is an essential conditioning for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, which in the larger or less measure are more reactions to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, which are 666 tourisms, 109 all-terms, 137 motorcycles, 78 cars and 44 trucks.

Once the model is identified to be repaired by its bastard number, a real graphic image of the model is presented and then the necessary change is selected.
The user may include variables such as the price of the work, recharges or downloads, and then you can print the budget to deliver the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but more than a reference catalogue.
The main difference between both systems is that the board oriented does not include estimated worktimes.
The cost of use of this tool for the payer is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
