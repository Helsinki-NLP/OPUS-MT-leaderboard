What's the cell? The word of the cell comes from the Latin word "cell", which means "small space", first used the scientist who observed the plumage structure through the microscope.
The cell is the base unit of all living creatures and all organisms are composed of at least one cell.
The cells are actually so basic and necessary to study life that we often call them "life citizens".
The life system of homeostaso is maintained by sending nervous signals through the body, thus ensuring normal and insufficient blood transfusion.
