Rehabilitation of the Republican Party against Obama
The Republican leaders rejected their policy for the need for fighting electoral subjects.
However, the Brennan's centre represents a myth that the electoral substrate is less frequent than the number of persons who die after a bleach.
Republican lawyers finally mentioned only 300 cases of elections in the United States in the last ten years.
One is sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on elections.
In this regard, these measures are partly underground by the American Democratic System.
The responsibility for the organization of the federal elections of individual States has been held from Canada in the United States.
And in this spirit, the governments of the American governments have announced new laws which are difficult for the election or writing process to the election list since 2009.
This evidence mentioned the extension of the elections in November 2010, during which 675 new Republican representatives arrived in 26 States.
In 2011 only 180 laws of restrictive electoral rights were presented in 41 countries.
The new electoral law requires the electors to present a demonstration of identity with photographs and the American State citizenship documents.
Furthermore, these laws restrict the periods for the elections in the preliminary, dismiss the right to register on the list of electors on the day of election and take the optional right to the citizens with the entry in the penalty register.
Before elections in 2006, he did not require the electors to provide a photograph of any American State.
By the State that made this request was Indian.
The Constitution of the Indian Law confirmed in 2008 the United States High Court.
The Republican authorities have accelerated the extension of this procedure and to the remaining States.
In the last two years, such laws have been supported in 34 countries with the aim of providing electors to present the evidence of identity with photographs.
It is necessary to note that they have no American citizens of universal identity, such as the health insurance card.
In the range of 11% of American citizens, namely 21 million people in the ability to choose, no evidence of the identity of photographs issued by the Governing Authority of their state.
There is no further evidence of the identity of approximately five million new electors in 2012.
Furthermore, the installation of the requested identity is often more than 100 dollars.
The new restrictions are not appropriately affected mainly by young people, minorities and low income members.
25% of Africans, 15% of people with a receipt under 35,000 dollars; 18% of 65 years older citizens and 20% of electors in 18 to 29 years have therefore no needed identity with photographs.
And that's not all.
Students who are like electors who know their devotion to democratic candidates are not authorised in a number of States to use their identity demonstration with photographs exposed to their school.
On the other hand, the Members of the Law or the fishing clubs who choose more than the Republican candidates allow cards exposed to those clubs to be used in the elections.
By 2004, no State requested a citizenship document.
This requirement made Ar'an.
Since 2011, approximately twelve states of law have adopted the obligation of electors to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are obviously intended to restrict the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It is also necessary to note that two of the three of the His's offers the advantage of the democratic side.
In 2011, the Republican legislators supported eight states of law which distorted the record of electors on the day of election.
They also restricted the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to electors who want to write.
This restriction has its effects.
For example, during the general elections in 2004, the electoral campaigns helped to register approximately 10 million people.
The measures adopted after 2009 but caused a decrease in the recording of new electors in 2010 to 17% above 2006.
The Republican legislators then adopted the laws for the reduction of the period of elections in advance in the next five states.
For example, during the general elections in 2008 in Florida, the African electors of the United States were 33%, even though African electors in this country were only 13%.
It was the same in His's.
They created only 11% of all electors, but 24% of the citizens voting before.
On the other hand, white people who represented 76% of all electors were only 46% of the electors who voted in front.
With regard to the approval of laws that restrict the registration of electors, of course, democracy lawmakers and their supporters have been very significant.
Democracy's locked their vet a few of the laws.
In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws, the General Prosecutor of the United States has even covered.
The damage often could be limited.
For example, only 16 of the 34 countries were adopted by the laws required to provide an identification of photography.
However, the newly introduced rules are completely difficult in the exercise of the voting right in 2012.
The democratic criticism is particularly referring to the prejudice of approved laws and considering them apparently attempted to affect the results of elections in 2012 in key States.
The Brandan Centre report of 2011 shows that the states where these laws were approved represent 171 of 270 votes in the assembly of electors necessary for victory in the presidential elections.
It is too soon to declare that these legislative amendments at the election system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
One is, however, certain today: these new provisions will have an incredible impact on elections.
In this regard, these measures are partly underground by the American Democratic System.
Discovering cancer of prosecution: resolve investigation or not?
PSA test brought leckdy wrong results, which were wrongly negative or even wrongly positioned, leading to unfair medical progress.
All this has even increased the weight of men who have already been taking the lead to the investigation at all.
Let's check or not?
We asked two experts.
In the United States studies, a high level of contamination between individual tested groups has been demonstrated, therefore, difficult to interpret these results and to bring a valued recommendation.
Other studies, this time European, have found a different death between patients who have undergone investigations and those who have not gone on them.
This study also demonstrated after 12-year degrees that those who do not have an investigation have 30-40% higher risk of metastasis.
So I recommend an investigation from 50 years of age or from 40 years of age, if your direct family had a prostitute cancer.
The more threatened groups are also men of African pump.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is discovered.
There are aggressions and kinds of cancer and such species that are inconsistent.
It is therefore necessary to explain the patient the risk of his kind of cancer, offer it possible alternatives, do not treat the needed cancer of prosecution that does not have an impact on life in the horizont, and in these cases, to focus on the active monitoring of disease.
Today, a number of men who have been cancerized are not treated because their kind of cancer is not an aggression and does not threaten them to life.
In addition, we'll take them more active monitoring, and in the case of progress, we'll offer them treatment.
We are still more frequently and more accurately set out the criteria helping to decide what kind of treatment and what not.
However, I recommend that the investigation be resolved.
It is important, however, to resolve the conversation with your doctor and to determine whether the appropriate investigation is to be subjected or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Company, the movement of Movember was a tool to evaluate for and against PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no wonderful procedure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, it seems to be the best way to restrict risks for the adoption of the principle of healthy life.
It is considered that if everyone eats healthy and moves sufficiently, it would be possible to prevail up to 30% of the cases of cancer.
"If everyone stop smoking, this data would be at least 50%," stressed André Beaulie, the Canadian speaker for cancer research.
In contrast, approximately 10% of cancer disease causes heritage.
Some percentages also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, it remains a priority for the fight against smoking, although the number of kidneys fall.
Cigarettes are 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several other.
It hurts human health.
"There's still 1.5 million kidneys in Quebec," he's wrapped with the head of speaker André Beaulie.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the bubble stops smoking, the risk of death on half cancer is reduced.
Powder
Corporation and obesity are, according to the SCC, another risk factor for disease.
Increasing the risk of hair cancer, warm hair and fingerprint, oil, slips and workshops.
"The research shows that the regular physical activity throughout the life protects from the cancer of the thick-ground," adds the report.
Exercise
The organisation also recommends limiting the need for red meat.
When too high insufficiency, it can lead to a increased risk of coloric cancer.
It is appropriate to ensure that the same approval applies.
Conservation of meat may lead to the creation of carcinogenic substances by the fat, suicide or salt.
"They can cause the damage of the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," adds the report.
Vitamine
Recently, different agents have focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the investigations have not yet concluded significant conclusions.
Vitamin E is distributed according to SCC.
Although one of them decreases the risk of cancer cancer, other studies speak more about its increase.
No vitamin D for cancer has been demonstrated uniquely.
Mr. Beaulie continues to keep on how important it is to talk about his concerns and concerns from your family with your doctor.
"The investigation doesn't mean you're gonna have cancer."
Higgs' bosson examined
An announcement of Higgs' probably discovery caused a legal disruption in the summer.
There is a view that this bosson shares in the mechanism that is responsible for all the weight in the universe.
And further is the last part of which the existence provides a standard model - our best or "almost bad" interpretation of respect and behaviour - which, however, has not yet been observed by empires.
However, there is not yet a degree of confidence that it is about Higgs' boss.
It does not doubt that we have a completely new part available, which is very like Higgs' bowl, as it is predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the large physical conference in Kuwait are further confirmed, but there are no more data, and they could have absolute security.
Nevertheless, let's assume that it's about Higgs' boss, because the risk of misleading seems to be small, and let's look at what it is actually going on.
In this world, the uncertain law applies, according to which two things cannot be produced at the same time at the same place.
This rule can't be obtained - and don't try too singlely, otherwise you'll hurt.
Although the particular physics is a very strange world, it is shown that it also applies the obscure law: Pauli's exclusive principle, which two parts cannot take the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quant status" - this "station" is about to create some of their properties.
It's going to split physics in two categories.
On the one hand, we will find organized citizens, or farmers who are obedient to Paul's principle.
And on the other hand, the bottles move, according to anarchists who do not appreciate anything -- so, of course, not this principle, which means that they can be quietly at the same place at the same time.
These thresholds continue to be divided into two groups according to equipment (in spite of the completely implied) such as The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley labs: the meals we leave here without attention, and the "force parts", which broadcast great natural forces and with which Higgs' bosson is probably determined in a way.
Yet, it is necessary to say that these beasts are not such exotic animals as it would be myself to think.
If you read this article, it's grateful to the bowl with an unusual banality: photon, or "part of the light", which is "nozer" of electromagnetic power.
When the same parts with electrical powder get or change their direction, they "interrupt" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, similar to the covered in the fisheries.
From this "exhaustion" the electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultrafial wave, etc.) and this wall is nothing other than photon - and then one of the bossons, "powerers".
Stabler fields
It's also with Higgs' hole, just with the difference that "short" is needed to be another field, Higgs' field to appear to this bosson.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to its excitation, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, similar to the frozen level of the fishermen, which already eat a lot of big balvan.
From this point, it is necessary to use such a huge partition engineer as a CERN laboratory - a large hadron-inhibitor with injective links is a circle with a range of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
Analogia with the electromagnetic field is going to explain the relationship between Higgs and the mass.
With the electromagnetic field, they do not respond neither all parts nor all materials.
Some, for example, magnetics, do so, but others do not - a paper cow, for example, can never keep it on the coat.
And it also applies that the Higgs field doesn't respond to all parts: those who do so have a certain weight while the final (for example, photons, let's look at it) have no.
And Mrs. Novak asks what all these research are, what they'll bring to us?
In view of the confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to determine any non-compliance between observation and SM predicts.
Furthermore, physicians have a letter to make it possible, because a smaller difference could open the space "new physics" and heal some spaces in the model.
It is necessary to note that the model has even great deficiency, does not provide any clarification of gravity (oha!) or dark weight that constitutes about 80% of the universe weight (never egg!).
However, the CERN device has not yet been discovered.
Reply
The responses of these research in the daily life of Mrs and Mrs. Novak can only be very difficult, but it would be a mistake to think that there is nowhere.
See: At the beginning of the 60s they had no losers in the Bell Labs or the ideas of the revolution that they have already been calling for.
They assumed uses, but nothing else.
The physician Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was found in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser paper (previous papers were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said that - laser was considered as such a "player in the lab".
Just imagine that...
Moreover, the application may also result from all tools that cover research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light recorder in 1969 during his optical work.
This filmer, although Boyle hadn't planned this at the beginning, now serves as "other" of all digital cameras in the world and has made Nobel's price for physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that activities around LHC need to change our life, but that means that man never knows...
Paliative care - The best way to get out of life... - Le Devoir
In the middle of its Commission for more sensitive death with Quebec, Quebec has recently been involved in the challenging issues on the end of life.
The debate should continue soon and at the same time wishes for law.
In this principle, there is still a lot of work.
The Le Devoir magazine tried to look at this question more detailed.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The cancer of the prostitution that fed her gave him a double-year departure.
"They gave me five years of life and it's seven years," he says without emotion on his bed in the house of paliating care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived last day.
"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The illness has done its work: the immortal weakness is able to take himself to the bathroom or just to eat itself.
Rezignowated looks at a pleasant breakfast and agrees that we will help him eat.
He is courageous and even smiles, talks with the unknown who are stopped, brings medicines to him, offers a bathroom.
Courage to the usual death.
"My biggest desire is to get out of this premium, that's humiliating me," he claims.
In a few hours later, he found the team of doctors for his medicine problem.
"In the whole life, a man learns that the guys are powerful for the vessels," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the child’s phase, some people are unacceptable humility.
"Depends on the ability of whose person," if the return is accepted, the psychologist says.
According to a series of persons who are killing paliative care, primary moments will be played in the single kernel of such return.
Patients who come home with Victor-Gadbois paliation care suffer cancer.
Their predict is a maximum of three months of life.
In this stage, the team of doctors and sisters who care for them does not provide such a "treatment" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, it is the worst fear to die "in the destruction of the fulldomies".
But the disease enabled me to discover my children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"I don't have any desire in my life anymore," he says, "and then he allows, and he has put it in a breathing device.
However, it is still happy in the following days for the last visit of the son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois's house, in collaboration with the group of volunteers, he provides care of the body with life.
So it looks like a paliative care that comes, if it can't do anything else.
That death would be more pleasant.
In Quebec, one candy is a paliative care for 11 700 inhabitants.
It's very little if we realize that everyone's going to die once.
Here the life continues in optimal arguments, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
What it is about the level of physical, emotional or spiritual satisfaction.
When a person dies, for example, a brandy or pepsy crack can be offered, according to the shock.
The diabetes don't need to keep the cold sugar anymore.
And death is part of every day's life here.
They brought a beer to Mr. X. last night, who died after night.
Today, his son's drinking a beer to honor his older father.
"We help patients as close to them," says Nathalie Savard, manager of career service.
In Victor-Gadbois's house, they're going after one another, but they don't like each other.
About 30 - year - old man who enjoys the last meeting with his family based on the pools, while he is attached to his honor, dies a tragedy of sixty - year - old man who is circumcised by his parents, wife and two small children after trying all the opportunities to survive.
"For half a year there are three to five beds that are designed for people with cancer up to 45 years," says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients who arrive at Victor-Gadbois home come here from their homes, 47% from the hospitals.
Problems with access to paliative care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians simply have no access to paliative care, i.e. to care that is intended to measure the suffering as soon as the disease grows into the final phase of their life, whether it is home, in the hospital or in the career house.
And a few organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois home and the Home Paliative Treatment Company of Grand Montréal, are specialised more less exclusively to care for oncological patients.
And this primary non-disponibility of health care in Quebec leads to that a number of doctors specialised on paliative care are afraid of the adoption of the law on eutanase and assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifest has been signed by spices in paliating treatments such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, where they make their indecision against such initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martels, the chebeck health system is not sufficiently implemented to ensure access to the quality paliative care of all persons before it agrees with the implementation of eutanase.
As she says, she has recently experienced a patient who has spent 14 days in a great pain, without any to make the necessary steps to delay her.
It is afraid that patients don't ask for death from the dead that they don't care appropriately.
And at the same time, a number of oncologists care for their patients until the last moments, without prejudice to an inappropriate predict.
On the survival of Helene Richards, she left the chemotherapy.
When I announced that I had finished the treatment, she replied that she was sorry to stop fighting, she told us.
And then she told me that it was the end!
There is no wholesome care
Dr. Martel recalls that 90% of the sick who want to die thanks to their doctors for not complying with their desires when their paliative kids have affected their pain.
However, it is necessary to say that paliative care is not absolutely almighty in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, paliative care directors in the Community for domestic paliation care of Grand Montréal, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% cases.
At the end of the life, doctors often use paliative sedatives that will be slow to the patient until a moment of screening, whether or whether sedatives are given to him permanently.
We can't imagine that we don't have this part of suffering.
The one that we do not bear pain will still have the opportunity of access to paliative sedatives.
The sick who is not sedative, they say the same, "I want to die."
But it doesn't have to mean "I want you to give me eutanase," it's more than "I want you to save me of pain."
This report enabled the grant for journalists from the Canadian Constitution for Health Research.
Expansional reality scandals in Quebec
The Officers of Travel Management, Employers in Construction and Public Services, Political Parties Lobbyists and Professors on the Italian Mafia continue to report what they do about the "sœem", in which they need building, state officers, politicians, experts and mafians.
This "work" has come to chebeck tax chargers very precious, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has been divorced since the time we've taken the primary measures," says Ironic Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec lawyer and former police head in Montreal.
In 2011, the scandal made a scandal based on an experienced survey related to the construction of the roads in Quebec, which then the liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved until long depths.
The Duchesneau report confirmed the direct connection between the industrial, non-transparent financing of parties and the corruption of State officials.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the Transport Ministry has saved a billion dollar's bans," when some people have kept their instincts on their trust to share them!
Charbonneau's committee "has brought two concerns to demission," adds with the idea that she will "reveal the lsticity of some people".
Standing unit for the fight against corruption based in 2011
The continuous unit for the fight against corruption based in 2011 is also involved in combating its armies of government controllers, investigators and analysis.
To that end, the police of the "Marteau's family" who have secured that since 2009 the "Financial Card" shows a significant measurement of the inflammation of the prohibition...
In the past weeks, they made a series of views and regreted from the subduction and corruption of a number of general representatives such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, an elder of a foreign country.
Next on the list, Gilles Vaillancourt, who just went away from his anxiety foreign Laval, the third largest Quebec city.
It is suspicious that he repeatedly accepted taxes by exchange for public prohibitions.
Formal accusations have also been received by transporting engineers from Montreal and Italian businesses, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lina Zambito called a sense by explaining to the Commission the mechanism "s" to obtain public orders.
In these years, he himself spent 3% of the value of the debt that he had received in Montréal to the architect associated with mafia, who then transferred money to Union Montréal, which was a candidate to the senior Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito was a successor in the year 2000 and had more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to the provincies, but especially to the liberals that were at that time in power.
He also recognized that he organized illegal funding for the former liberal Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Requirements of money carrying over prices
In Montreal, the "with" corruption worked very clearly.
Gilles Surprenant, former carrier engineer, described him very detailed before the Commission: for ten years, he received from the building company of gifts, calls for outlets, golf tours, restaurants, hoke stores and hoke stores for a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for money charges in which he was based on the price.
Other public operators in the transport sector admitted that they had allowed a recompense for 30% to 40% overestimating the factures by uncertain multi-works.
The Old Party's organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye that he had without disturbance put the eyes on the competitive budget that brought his money into his stocks.
On the basis of these Tremblay discoveries, on the beginning of November, Montréal departed from the extent of the crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first shower lawyers who issued a warning signal.
As the Rivière-des-Prairies surroundings on the east of the island, since 2010, it is contrary to the sale of the general land buyed for $5 million and sold for $1.6 million promotors directly in the flowing trade with immobility.
70% of spending money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be started, says that "thinks are able to understand the functioning of the promoted morbidity system to stop the gangrene and to defeat the wines."
It says that the process is "worrying, but positive."
We are in the cleaning stage, but it is necessary to set up our own investigation unit in Montréal and to ensure that these doubting practices cannot return.
It's like it's getting clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public factors have cut off hundreds of millions of dollars", but it is particularly afraid of the role of "posters informed about this mail" if they haven't learned in these chains!
It recalls that 70% of the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec comes from spending money, and adds with ironie, "I have heard it's just a weak reaction."
The Quebec Government intends to limit the gifts to the parties to $100, but it does not determine: "When the choice expenses are extremely limited, the money of the policy will not be lost."
It is a complex control of the public prohibition and financing system: "We can't be able to decline before; if we are courageously focused on the basis of things, we can rebuild on stronger foundations and with more control and compliance with the laws."
Duchesneau recommends all who smile him to look at his own court...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
You and the PSG have put a full new time in this way.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by all individuals went to themselves, or by a completely new PSG dimension.
The big players came to us.
Every day, I'm getting close to them.
The technical team also helped me too much.
Each day, these features allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier at the ships.
Everything goes terriblely in Débale.
I'm not doing my head.
Since my starts in the preparation in INFièreirefontaine, I thought about a single degree after I moved to Saint-Etienne.
So you're using the competitive ≥ that Carlo Ancelotti has...
The posts of this year are usually playing stocks at a very high level.
They also know that each train is essential.
And from that it proves that a player like me then has the most pleasure to get back and wants to give the maximum performance.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me much about my position.
At hands he has assistants like Makelele, who played on the same place as me.
And Ancelotti has a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all the technicians.
Today, it has no equality in the first line and belongs to the best European trainers.
He has great experiences, and he has a lot of titles with his teams.
He also worked with great players.
I think he wins other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a calm conversation with him.
I had a lot of hurt behind me.
The confidence he gives me is the next day of my performance.
How are you looking at the first part of the PSG?
In the first line, Lyon took our head position.
But we're staying in the cover.
One of our main goals is the League of Masters: we have been very easily passed into the occifinal.
What does your club do in this competition?
We'll go next.
Whatever happens can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a hard support for the quality of European teams.
First, we want to win our →group before the Port, and we could play at the osmifinal rental at home.
Can the PSG become a large European club in a short horizon?
It's already...
In order to become a large European club, Paris must win titles and enter the history.
It's not that way today.
The PSG has a PSG on the financial side to achieve this purpose.
And would there be a big failure to win in the first lira like in the lonely?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year we want to win the ligue title.
We missed enough in the lowland.
We were disappointed in May because we had it, and we won.
We had a nice match.
We collected 79 points.
It usually applies that with 79 points you are a master...
But another Club, Montpellier, had a more spectacle.
I think that's gonna be done this year.
Although there are great teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have a weapons available, and they have hit them.
Do you think the media from the PSG is expecting too much?
It's not unusual to expect us much because of what was invested and what we have players.
That's all we're accepting.
It's the fact that when we hit Troyes 4:0 at home, and there's still something that they'll tell us in the news, it's not just pleasant.
Man asks what people can want more from you.
Of course, you can't win 4:0 on every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up the herni.
You're time to build the team.
In Lisa of Masters, we proved that we could play.
Look at Manchester City, who hasn't been trying to eight finals once again, and they have also invested great amounts!
In view of invested sums, you would be able to wait before the last 15 points of shopping!
That's what you're doing with the final clubs and the French ligue.
The clubs of Lyon and Marseille, which had not been too low in the remote, moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how the first liga is u.
I hope we will be able to laugh in May and say that, despite all the hard things, we have been able to win.
It seems that the PSG in everything is going to handle the performance of Golden Ibrahimovic.
It's good to say there's a "dependence on the Golden."
That means Ibrahimovic is very effective and he gives many.
That's why he came here and showed that he's the star of the ligue.
Everywhere he passed, he showed that he was a big player, a world star.
In our team, we respect humans and players.
He also respects people around him.
What he got is really exceptional.
This also led the final to increase their own levels.
Thiago Silva, who belongs to the best dealers in the world, also allows the final growth near itself.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French representation?
Like disappointment.
I wanted to play on this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of hurt, I couldn't play as I could imagine.
But I survived it, and I went out of it stronger.
Today, I can play a good storage in the representation.
And I hoped that since I came to the representation.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to be an example of our presentation.
How are you looking at the first months of Didier Deschamps in the head of the national team?
They're talking about the outcomes.
We're in the MS . We're in a good place.
The trainer chooses hardly, it's near to players and can breathe for victory.
That's how Laurent Bla's been.
I don't want to compare them.
Bla's achieved his goal by we're going to the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will bring our team to Brazil.
Is reduction (1:1) of 16 October in Spain a solid outcome?
This story gave us a self-conscious conscience.
We were all fighting for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I haven't lived such a warehouse for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without bank
All negative current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and costs for the processing between beneficiaries.
In addition, as these are often true, there is a manifest political view: convincement that the existing financial system based on bank monopols leads to financial crisis.
Bitcoin, whose finder is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents how money (but transferable to dollars, euro...), such safe translation protocol similar to BitTorrent that allows the exchange of files between two partners.
Approximately 200 000 transactions have been registered by 15 000 computers already involved in the network.
About a thousand web pages already accepts bitcoins as gifts or as payments.
The bitcoin currency first reached the maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later decreased to $2 and now moved to the border of about $10 (curs view is listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
In comparison with the world exchange for real money or financial products, it is nothing impressive.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this regard in its report on the financial funds issued in October.
Bitcoin means "the most successful money", "the competitive dollar and the euro" and "the period of running money".
Bitcoin is different from the remaining kinds of money by using it as "credits" for a video game that man gets a game or that can buy (and leckdy and exchange).
The Facebook social network also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the Central Authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are the books of running books, controls, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two persons runs between two email addresses.
However, the user may choose another address for each payment to ensure anonymity.
The information file relating to this transaction is electronically signed by the dual key encryption system.
The network can verify the right of transaction.
The content of the file is further possible to ensure that changed bitcoins exist in the public book of currents distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is recorded in this new transaction in this book.
It is trying to solve the mathematical task given to computers whose solution, as a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is the stage of file resolution; it is the transformation of a huge file to a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers will "mapping" this new transaction and add a number to it, and then they're going to "screw".
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (much nul at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, the final nodes will easily check his rights.
The transaction will then be undestructively displayed on the string of all final transactions; any adjustment would take place to change the printing.
If the person wants to pay the same money twice for himself (in 10 minutes), the network will only confirm one of both transactions - the second will be left because each of them has a different print.
The computer that resolves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this refund will be divided regularly to two, probably until the end of 2012.
The start of bitcoins in the course is so limited to the number of 21 million, but it can be divided up to a million, so the margin space is here...
The difficulty of the assigned task is also increased by the increased level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its rise and falls.
The web pages that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and have reached the depreciation of stored bitcoins.
"Used sculpture does not apply to a protocol alone," assured Pierre Noizat, which founded Paymium, a company for payments using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibilities of spending money through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to the finishing.
Excellent players like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this respect.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Sha and Dorit Ron from the Weizman’s constitution in Israel recently analysed the book of running and showed that 80% of the bitcoins were not running.
In November, "groups" were started.
"Treenty thousand dollars have been changed," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul with a change of bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogic book about these money, has great confidence in the potential of this character as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is an equivalent credit card (with money) or an uncontact payment with a mobile, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions which are more profitable.
Moreover, the carrier manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up in traders where new terminals or software are not required.
It's enough to communicate the address that can be "fotographed and spread", explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that he already has thousands of people.
The general movement is to doubt hierarchy systems and transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin comes out, it still takes a while, but 2013 may be a decision," she predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB assumes the review of the different risks which today are considered to be increased if this kind of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What about the next?
The French units left their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and American units should follow at the end of 2014.
It's time for the Afghanistan Army to take control over his territory and the Afghanistan to choose their own future and not to wait for everything from us.
The biggest imprisonment suffered people in the Afghanistan forest that we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we have come with 88 killed soldiers, and all of them are hurt and frozen.
The Talibans are constituted of the foreign extremists, the former leaders of the representatives who passed to Pakistan, but often refers to foreigners who refused the presence of the foreign army as in the Soviet times.
They only want to protect their ancient and archaetic traditions, even though they were joidians, Pakistanians, Arabs, Uzbek, Tajikians.
Now the tolerants and often help local rebels, but if western forces are downloaded, their support will be decreased.
The department of French units from the Niirab foundation, which I followed from the tops of the mountains of Mandlone, by the French loans, was running in order.
The convoy of trucks and panced vehicles arrived in Cabul without attack on air transport helicopter.
Since the end of 2014, the Talibans are so active in Kabul.
Since their instaurable procedures in 1994 to 1996, submissions have changed significantly.
Cabul was empty at that time and the land was in the blood and fire in the light of wars between different relief groups.
Their control over the land was then considered as a kind of freedom, return to security.
The Afghanistans paid the price for the darkness of those foreigners who were completely controlled by the Al-Ka'id organization, but their ability has not improved in our time.
Some more mudjahedrins, the Afghanistan government and the modern Talibans agree to keep women in the underlying position.
The votes of war against the Soviet units returned to the power in 2001.
They became captains, strengthened state lands that were sold as building lands from Iran and Pakistan, and used great American prohibitions for subproducers.
They were discredited; most of them were never in the fight.
According to what I heard in campaigns, people want a government to make evil.
A number of young people want to go as they leave those who have been able to use America's beauty: the outcome is significant.
Young people are already engaging in the war and the ideology associated with it.
During the expulsion of Iran or Pakistan, they have known the modern world and his benefits have been revealed.
Approximately 65% of the population is younger than 25 years; in Kabul, 5 million people are currently living, 5% of the total population.
In towns, the state schools are full, girls and boys are coming there.
These young people will need to provide work, and they do not want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
All, including armed oppositions, have mobile phones; televisions and Turkish series, which show modern world, follow everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the offices that will be placed in her head be considered legitimate?
Some of the leaders of the fight against the Soviet Army are already renewed the provincies, which will be without control of central power.
Afghanistan, the country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy a certain measure of decentralisation after the model of the Western States, but the United States wanted to convert it to centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the premises position that had already existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964.
The President Karzai does not want the control of the operation, especially when the elections are planned for April 2014.
His country, however, has been very dependent on relief assistance since the 50s and previous years.
No industrial could be renewed, no forest works, no principle inflammation system is actual.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruit and greenine.
Presidency has a private initiative.
In the country devastated three decades of wars, the government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
The reports have been reported that Afghanistan has a huge richness.
And it just experienced the feeling that western states were here just for strengthening her.
Without energy for the processing of rail red or brass at the place and without cups for the transport of sugar through the mountain, no weight of nerves can be caused.
The Chinese have already abandoned the heat of Mes Aynak and have left international archaeological teams (for the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore an extensive Buddhist area to maintain the role of the most important employees in the entire province.
On one day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends largely on imports and exports, will also be required to restore normal relations.
The release of French war units was completed on November 20.
The new series of cooperation provides for the continuation of running types of aid: girls and boys, French catedries at universities, French institutions, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural, support for the Archeological Delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative was to "acquire heart and soul" attempting to make an inevitable task to help and military activities, and then the service of the "Cimic-Army Steps" of the Defense Minister (Cimic), which was canceled in 2012, but has been achieved thanks to the uncommon French non-governmental organization of success in the common interest and steps for agricultural renewal in the tens of mountain villages.
These works involving a number of local workers helped to deteriorate the resurrection: inflammation, sources, drinking water, inflammation, fruit trees, ground protection and the extension of the processable area.
What do we leave after two billion euros of military expenditure?
Much more modest budget would contribute to improving local lives undermines, which are very difficult in these valleys, often in overseas height over 2,000 meters.
Velvyslanect received decades of written requests for small agricultural assistance from local communities in the province of Capis.
In order to free these agricultors from the resurrection of the leading groups, they wish, according to their words, to gain indispensable civil aid in their benefits, which would be properly controlled and directly touched.
Difficult work in Egyptian state
President Muhammad Mursy left the next part of the poker.
While Egypt remains most divided in his history because of the declaration of a constitution that temporarily gives him unlimited powers, he decided to play a Vabank.
Without prejudice to the opinion of all the finals, he notified that the Constitutional Meeting will soon approve the final version.
A few months ago, the head of the State has granted this meeting to the end of the necessary work.
It has already been two years to use the preliminary text, which has been added many times, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal income.
This new initiative has continued to strengthen the diversity of the country.
In view of the opposition, the president remains in his "autocratic part", continues to "building his word" and "making the right".
However, his representatives assure that it is the way I do not want to overcome the constitutional and political crisis and the transitional process.
Reference should be done within two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that will bring Brothership away from the purpose of the text to the Egyptians to explain the article after the article.
The President is also about how to achieve national and democracy legitimities again, while the whole country rejects protests.
As he confirmed in the conversation of the American Week Time, Muhammad Mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
In particular because this rapidly organized vote is made by the Egyptian people before the finalum: "Be my text, or I leave the unlimited powers," which would otherwise have to end after the approval of the new statute.
And in this special air, the text was approved by 85 cases of a constitutional conference with a large majority of islamists yesterday.
The majority of liberals missed voting.
In the middle of November, no longer before the constitution was published, they bought the doors with no opportunity to make their opinions.
The human rights officers, civil society or religious minorities imitated their steps.
In order to achieve deterioration capacity, 11 persons from a series of replacements were rapidly supplemented yesterday.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
It is not surprised that the articles of the Constitution were often denied in unity.
The commentators continued to stop that one of the no-conflicts walked around the day... the hours for prayer, when some members of the Committee insisted that the hours at the meeting of the room were not correctly organized.
The text that was voted last night is consistent with 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, article 2, is finally compatible with the version of the Constitution of 1971 and states that "the rules of law are the main source of rights".
The Salafist parties for which the introduction of the Islamic Rights to one of the fundamental requirements was expected to replace the term "principal" with the term "regulation", which would enable more harder application.
For islamists, the fact that this article is not corrected, represents the sign of their good will and respect for the final part of the Egyptian company.
"Crystals," the liberals who see it only a Greek problem.
According to them, the islamization of the constitution runs through other articles.
They are particularly concerned with Article 220, which believes at the University of Al-Azhar the advisory role, in particular for the control of the conformity of laws with the law of Sharia.
According to the experts in Egypt, Soèe Pommier, it is disappointing because "persons authorised to express are not chosen and have no democratic legitimate.
It can be watched at the beginning of the theocracy."
Freedom's concern is even more reflecting that the next university director should be less murdered than the existing.
"In the meantime, there was no specific religious actor.
This position remains the Egyptian citizen State.
Most lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulamers, but university workers, who studied a number of them at French schools," the peaceful anxiety of Alexis Blouet, who prepares for a constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, it agrees that "they can be discussed regarding the interpretation of Article 220 because the useful terms in it belong to the religious vocabulary.
There is in particular a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic law, p. red].
And in the future, there can be a question in which civil judges are competent to express it."
The text approved yesterday is very criticised outside the religious pages by the extensive powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brotherhood continues to take place their significant restriction against the former regime.
Other conflicting place: powers of confidential army.
In accordance with the desire of the representatives of the Army, it is to verify the budget for the defence of Parliament, but the National Council of Defence.
Thereafter, in military courts, a civilist's management was prohibited, as required by a community to protect human rights.
This association refers to its doubts in relation to the text that is intended against freedom according to them.
The injury is maintained and the injury is continued to be prohibited, which may have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for printing.
Furthermore, none of the articles are concerned with a protective woman, highlights Heba Morayef from the Human Rights Watch Organization.
It states that the only positive point of torture is prohibited in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous statement.
While the Egyptian president had to go out in television speech last night, manifestations were planned today afternoon.
The state's heads will then be shown on Saturday.
In Israel they wait for the Ukrainian tourists holy places, the pool of the world and the sea from a saturated solvent of salt
The earth that is promised is associated with the size of Bible truths, modern comfort, and nature’s uncleanness.
AaF identified five of the most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Worship Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It claims that everyone who enters this "great" will deceive God’s mercy.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus ’ miracles: the changes of water into wine in marriage, the walking after water, the calmness of the storm and the filling of the network.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here will go through the Path of pain or Jesus Christ's Crossway (Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at Antonia - Pretoria - where the court was executed, passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the temple of God’s grave on Mount Golgota - to the place of crossing, to the stone of anointedness and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is a symbolic Christian pump of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the clothes of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem were placed in a place where, according to the Christian legends, the tree of which they made the cross to Jesus ’ cross.
In Jerusalem, there is also the most holy place for the Jews - the wall of the Narrows, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different confessions are denied by the records with desires that will be fulfilled afterwards.
Busy the path vertically
Masada’s strongness remained secretly covered before the enemy, which Herod the Great set for his family in 25 B.C.E.
The race is located in the mountains at the overseas height of 450 m above the sea level.
With its own forces, only those who kill horolozects can get to her.
Others to this historical mountain will bring a lawn.
And in the north of the country, the oversea height of 1600-2040 m is a famous lyzing centre of Hermon, which lives in winter months a huge tourist attack.
To this lygership, he transports tourists from the copper of a kyle bus.
The total length of the mountains is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, the Gentiles lived evidently on the top of the mountain.
Visit a unique museum
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit all in one way.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are determined to be a visit.
Among them is Israel’s Museum, located near Knesset (parlament).
It contains ancient Kumaran manuscripts or the Dead Sea wheels found in the wilderness of Judah, and thereby approximately 500 thousand archeological and antropological exposures.
The Museum of Kunst in Tel-Aviv is also a visit.
In his exhibition, they are largely represented impresionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which represents the visitors several rooms of ancient Turkish lazzles with figures of laz and lazens treated from that time.
In Caesarea, there is a unique private museum of Ra, where you can wonder the Dalí and Roden Society.
There's no pools or rooms with suvenirs.
Input is free and gifts are extremely refused.
Fifth Museum - Museum, or Yad Vashem, in Tel Avivu - reports one of the most dramatic pages of the history.
The most traceful part of Museum - Child Memorial - was set to memory of 1.5 million children who were killed in concentration camps and gas rooms.
You're going inside - and you'll be in full darkness.
Stars are crazy.
And the names of the Jews and the names of the lands in which they were destroyed.
Ukraine is also stated.
Enhance your health
Three main league centres of Israel are placed on the coast of the Mediterranean, the Red and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers basens, acvaparky, delfinary and oceanary.
It is interesting that the Red Sea can be purchased in winter months because the water temperature in it is not under 21 degrees of Celsia and the air is burned up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is still heavyer, and people buy themselves all the year in it.
The dead sea is the most special sea in the world, is located in the lowest peár point of the planet - at level 417 m under the sea level.
Asylum water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily maintains at levels and persons that cannot float.
The surrounding country is not realisticly beautiful.
Get here to deal with the treatment with the use of salt water - solars, and with the medical bath that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthmates, exheems, arthritis, injury, sugar so that you may treat the hearing nerves.
Take a secret past
The ancient part of Tel Avivu - Jaff's city at the Coast of the Mediterranean.
Through them, the glorious seaways associated with Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through them.
Changes about this city are made in the oldest Greek and Egyptic legends.
According to the legends, the place where Noah set his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromed, with which they lived together a long and happy life.
Tourists, in fact, love towels with lowly clusters, named after the signs of the animal.
It's said if you press the walls in the wall of your sign, you'll be lucky.
In Jaffa, you may meet new husbands who come here from all Israel and even from other countries to allow them to photograph.
And in Caesarea, in the city of King Herod, you can go through the Roman magician and "smooth" the strength of cross.
In the Roman times, Caesarea was the capital city of Judah and the seat of the Roman prosecutors, Pilate Pontian.
The quietly reconstructed division is used today for dinner concerts and operational representations.
Tourist, on a word
If you want to go to Israel, you don't have to be worried about your imperfect English: about 30% of the Russian population in this country.
It's better to get money with you, not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shekels (now it's about 3.8 shekels).
The city’s transport is mostly buses, but in Jerusalem, the tramway is running, and in Haifa is the only line of meters in the country with six stations, which connects the town down to the top.
It's basically the underground road.
Traveling to all types of city public transport is 6 shocks that you can carry for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to the Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Sabbath.
From Friday evening to the west of the sun on Saturday, it stops working on markets, trades and public transports.
And on Sunday, it starts working weekly.
In many cafés, restaurants and hotels, you will only get food cosher: with the exception of the wheat meat, the sea fruits, the fish without shops and the foods containing the combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large choice of foods from lamb and animal meat, powders and dezerts, prepared from cocotic milk, traditional Jewish cash hummus, the most different species of cow, the bowls of milk kitchen - falafel, fruit and greenine.
In the streets of Israel's cities, there are no towel dogs.
That's why there's a lot of hot cats here, which graciously "tools according to their shoes".
At evening hours, you can see them sleeping and on parked cars.
Predouing cats love sole places, and with silence they leave in every kind of goodness.
The car loan will be from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And it's going to be around 15 shekels per day.
The inputs in the museum are in the average of 30 shekels.
Numbers printed
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists worldwide.
To recognize the country and relax the most of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The Promised Land has visited 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is more than 51% in the same period in 2010, before it is deleted, see February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce to Moscow: Emigrants' money to the language
While Members and human rights protectioners are still discussing the law on obligational language tests, the country has already been detected by subheaders who sold the "paid" certificates.
To Moscow, Petrohrada and other Russian towns, 13 million per year arrive.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkey.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support the family at home.
On the first day, the Law entered into the law, whereby every worker migrant will be required to make a test of the knowledge of Russian language.
However, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the sector of services, housing and community, livelihood and small commercial sales.
FMS, however, promises that sometimes the relevant tests will be binding for all visits.
However, tests will be not only from language knowledge but also from Russian history and rights bases.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend work authorisation.
The vote applies only to the citizens of the countries where the Russian is official language.
This law does not be subject to people who have succeeded in achieving the certification and obtaining a academic diploma to the SSSR diffusion in 1991.
Benefit, judgment and protection of rights
The network of experimental places will work under the protection of Puschinov's Russian Constitution, University of friendship between nations, Moscow State University, State University in St. Petrohrada and other Russian High Schools.
Migranti can make tests in all towns; now more than 160 such centers have been opened in Russia.
Initiatives for supporting testing were also supported by Members of State duma and FMS (F.P.A.).
But before the law entered into force, human rights protectioners have been able to put the print of the question: and what will it bring in?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for their own visits?
In particular, - the representatives of the services are responsible - will allow it to reduce the number of people suffering in the result of "other work".
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migration workers, explains the President of the FMS Russian representation in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be started before they leave.
Only the organized set system will allow 90% to solve the problems of the employment work.
Problems arise in emigrants without calling, without education that don't know the language and have no medical view.
Without knowledge of the language - he says with the convincement of Sebelev - the future migrant is condemned to the consequences with unrespectable people who will help him to ensure "manage" in the worst, precise places in which he will be, and tens of others, such as he himself, to take all months without food and documents and to drive through 12 to 14 hours a day.
From our migration work, we get a lot of tired.
"In their authority they are promised one, but after they come, they are undergoing, they feed them, they don't pay the promised sales," confirms the leader's Tadic administration job of MS Tolib Sharip.
Don't hope!
The less than that many citizens of the Central Asian Republic who intend to educate for work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country in which they want to get, but they do not have experiences even with that work.
Of course, it is not even their guilt, as the rather unfortunate: one very little Turkmen, Uzbeki, Tadjiki can allow at least appropriate basic education.
Because their families also have something to eat children, not talking about the need to be honestly dressed, clothed and equipped to school.
As children grow into the productivity, they must be reported for work at the first time.
Without knowledge of the language, it's hard - acknowledged.
"You feel humiliation and minority."
It is true that, in view of the law on language tests, human rights protectioners indicate one important thing.
The test will be carried out only in the migrants who have legal position.
They will have him, and they will not have any tests, nor will they get any other official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migration workers live illegally as before in Russia.
"Welcome, or unconscious entry is prohibited"
Many of the coming works claim that obtaining official status in our country is nothing easy.
D.'s birocratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
Legalisation is more than money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubbles.
But false registration can be obtained only one and a half thousand.
The Russian police employees believe we have basically false documents, without registration, and that is the case of exemption.
"They require a hundred, two cigarettes, the tea," he shared with journalists about their experience in Tajikistan Umed Chuskadamov's citizens.
"Come on, come on, come on, buy me a male."
On the first day of validity of the language law, it was found that false documents of migrants were not only registered.
FMS employees have already enjoyed a number of false certificates on language testing.
The paint documents are printed on normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners were missing free: each of the migrants in nai, that they would so easily make a problem with testing, paid for this document seven thousand rubbles.
It's two and a half times higher than the issue of the official test: this will be a migrating work of three thousand rubbles.
The task of the closest future is to ensure the system of corruption so that the workers cannot easily buy documents, the government officials and human rights protection.
Government authorities may yet promise the employees who have not been able to test the first time to determine the basis of Russian language.
In visits that do not have Russian, work is assumed in non-requiretive people's activity.
MVD (International Ministry) does not take the illegal market with weapons
The share of criminal acts with legally holding weapons is very low
MVD Russia presents us a violation of law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
It is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: the cases of shooting on weddings that were surrounded without victims, and the massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dimitrium Vinograd, whose consequences destroyed seven people.
Police wants to prohibit the weapon of dangerous weapons at public places and to increase the licence from which we can get weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea supports the head of the Committee on Peace and Battle against the Corruption of Irina Jarovaja, which promised that changes in weapons law would be submitted to the State fury in close future.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian State authorities are trying to cope with the problem with the "shopping of shoes".
In the network, an open letter was revealed, which the authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - require the refusal of "insensitive disappointment" of the law.
The percentage of bullyanity with registered weapons is minimum, declared Vassilij Lesnikov, a lawyer and a criminal in the conversation with the Russian BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, in six months of 2012 142 criminal acts with the use of the shoot weapons registered by the Ministerial Authorities inside, while at the same time, 1168 thousand penalties were retained.
The authors of the opened letter are convinced that the violation of legislation in civil weapons does not allow the pachator to go to the "black" market.
According to their words, we can currently find a libovolous weapon at low price in Moscow.
The Ministry currently states that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from travels to professionals
Black market with weapons is resourced by several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baranec, who worked ten years in the School Ministry and the General School.
Screenshot page accepting weapons charges
With them -- "armed or military road", it means a weapon that was cut off during the battles in Kavkaza.
"The weapons were stealed by the Russians and the alone cavkazanas," he says Baranic.
Other types of black weapons are stealed criminals in security force representatives.
The Baranek explains that this includes the stealing of the police funds and the weapons stolen directly from the employees of the criminal authorities.
Illegal "major" is available to sale from military funds.
In many military funds, explosions often occur.
"They have been demonstrated that some fires have been placed in order to cover the miss," said the former soldier.
They offer their contribution according to the words of Barance and weapons producers.
"There are currently private weapons, which are not competitive on the international market, and are cutting up the weapons that are added to the black market in Moscow," says the expert.
Another "black" market source is feeding.
Especially a large number of weapons and machines comes from poor countries, such as Cyrgyzstan.
"There's their production, sometimes the weapons are produced here in the smaller, and the mafia that organized their gas production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Professors have found the approximate share of individual resources delivery of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was processed in 2011 by the Centre of Analysis of Problems and Designing of Public Administration.
The Specialists took the orders of the Ministry of the Interior and of the Russian Statistics Authority, the Crimeology and the data of public data ports related to these weapons.
The major number of illegal weapons, the investigators, originate from military and executive authorities.
The half of all weapons have felt on the black market "the guilty of official factors whose work is connected with weapons," says the report.
According to data that researchers have available, 17% of the weapons from armed conflicts, 14% of the cases have occurred to steal weapons during their production, 5% are "black archeology".
The seller-con-con-constant of one of the trades with weapons he requested, and they did not say his name, is convinced that weapons found in black "archeology" bursts are too old for a long time.
The most often, as he says, the sellers are running for new trucks directly to military funds.
Through the puzzle, the interesting bought a unit, such as the TT gun.
U.S. you're buying your weapon and he's selling it to you through the floor.
"It'll take her into the city and sell it for 900 euros for a cup of two ships," she says.
"P's that the police is good in the picture, and therefore, whenever they are forced to burn a plan in the clarification of criminal acts, they will carry out control purchases in trademakers with illegal weapons," adds the adviser.
"As in the luxury business"
Sellers with the purchasing most often take one another through their known ones.
I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Tests", where there will be a man who would bring me into the "angle" where we will work together.
I've learned the price primarily until there.
Military rapporteur Viktor Baranec
If you get a weapon, the known who knows the way out, the seller will report - a adviser. - I have such a known man, but I don't trust him completely.
The sellers are on the market, but there is also need to go, hypoteticly "of Mr. Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to arrange that the daughter had fallen out the teeth."
And now I'll get there through the man I'm just.
He also gives them to me only because he knows that I don't give it.
Starters are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the half of the 90s when he processed a station to publish this subject.
The schema hasn't changed according to his words.
They gave him the album with photos, where it was "all as you thought."
"I felt like in a luxury business," he cried out a soldier.
The purchaser, according to the words of Baranca, doesn't offer to go into the pitch - you can try everything.
I, the potential client, I just don't buy-- we're going with the seller in the forest and we'll make it a bullet.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I convince me that the weapon is shooting well, we start acting," describes the prosecutor's procedure.
Container
Searchers will bring you to the web pages and groups to the "Contact", where they are offered to buy a weapon "for different weapons".
It does not require any documents or personal meetings.
"Available to have a specified amount of money," they write in the advertising title on the web pages "Buy a fight gun or auto".
On these pages, those who refuse their notifications and ask questions.
And sell unflying?
"Of course, without license," questioned the "Ivan" (writer is kept).
"I'm buying TT.Moscow" is formulating the "Fedorenkov" requirement.
The Federal Security Service has recently determined a huge network of web sites and persons who want to buy a military weapon can be able to acquire a lopat.
People's gone like honey fishes on the floor, and then a long time of carbon on Siberia.
Military rapporteur and higher military officer Viktor Baranec
I have heard of such schemes:web pages are usually registered for the practice of Russian laws.
People's taking a debat.
Buyer's payment through bankomate.
"In the reaction, the seller sends him a photo and description of the guidelines where the weapon is hidden," reports the printing speaker's non-governmental organization "Right to Weapons" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranec confirms that after a complaint is assigned on the web pages you can stay without weapons and feel out of the network.
The Federal Security Service has recently determined a huge network of web sites and persons who want to buy a military weapon can be able to acquire a lopat.
"People are driving like hot fishes on the floor, and then hours of carbon on Siberia," he confirms.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal shooting weapons, you will pay a total of 100 to 900 dollars according to the estimate of the professionals.
According to the words of Dmitry Kislow from the non-governmental organization, you will order Makarov's weapons for $100 to $300.
You have to wait for a month and a half of a month.
The weapon shall be sent from the funds to the storage of the funds of the Central Article.
According to the Official Statistics Authority, the amount of these criminal acts in Russia was decreased in comparison with the ice - in October 2011 by 7%, and made 22.9.000 cases, and the number of explained cases of furnishing and exhibition of weapons, shooting, explosion and explosive equipment decreased by 7.8%.
Fixfood and supermarket work in the United States
It works on the "McDonald" carrying up to the quarter of all American teenagers
In the last days in America, the vault of protests against low recompenses was raised in Walmart's hypermarkets and in restaurants of the ≥-scale chains, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentıky Fried Chicken".
No one can be able to predict whether this wall is changed to the nineth wall or whether it is sentenced to be disappeared soon.
The entire action supports the committees and a series of Left Community organizations.
In addition to enhancing the modesty payments of the work of the Walmart and in the cohesion systems, the aim of protest organizations is to achieve the creation in their committee organizations.
Currently, this economic sector is in the practical manner of vocational movement.
46 cents per year?
Actions started last week after the Day of Thanksgiving, in such a "Black Friday", when she hit the orgy of leaving sales on America, took millions of people and in some cases it was also delivered by the rocks.
On this day, some Walmart's workshops, where they work on 2,2 million people worldwide, left their work and demonstrated together with the committees and left activities of the overnational trade chain companies whose goods are designed to people from the lower and central classes.
Walmart sells everything throughout the world, from a floor through the lobby guns and a car battery to a swimming, sheep and milk.
Its sales are 8% up to 27% lower than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many employees with low sales in Walmart's sales purchases only in their own work.
Availability and sorting of goods have been performed from Walmart's string one of the largest companies in America.
According to the critical words, Walmart may allow to sell goods so deeply partly because he only pays little to his employees.
They also deal with bad works, such as the lack of automatic vehicles or hand scanners.
Demonstrants requested increase in payments on the Black Friday and demanded that the costs for health insurance provided by companies increased from $30 to $100 per month.
The typical worker Walmart gets $9.5 per hour, but it does not correspond to the expenditure height, they say employees.
Scientists from the of California in Berkeley conclude that if Walmart increases the average payment to $12 per hour, it will be $3.2 billion per year.
It is more than 1,1% than this company is currently paying for payments.
Walmart will move the increase of the costs fully on the owners' branches, each visit in the sale will only be 46 cents more.
In a year, the customers will lose about $12,39 more than today.
Walmart's officers indicate that the protest was only in nine countries and that the company should not cause any damage practically.
"Black Friday" in the sales of the company was from 8 hours evening on Thursday to midnight next day, and during this time, Walmart sold about 5000 items of goods per second.
Overall, her stocks have been carried out on "Black Friday" to 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company Dan Fogelman in a conversation for the left-handed web site Huffington Post said that the work of the place was left by "lower than five" of Walmart employees and that it was protested over all the "only medical feelings" organized by the committees.
"It's an unobjected treasure!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart's business houses (they in this progress town are not too fair, and therefore they are not here), but "McDonald" and other mild restaurants.
McDonald says he sells a billion portions, and then he doesn't pay you adequately for your honest job!
Jumaane Williams, member of the city Council in New York
Currently, the minimum payment for work is made in accordance with the federal laws and the provisions of New York State $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants progressively increase this salary, but only quietly, and in the prospect they have a range of work in New York $8.90 per hour.
There is no lower reward in this dear city.
I don't understand enough how you can exist in New York for such money.
Employment at McDonald is going to pass at the same time a quarter of American teenagers who work after school after a partial account and live with their parents.
Just a few people look at their main source of life or plan to stay overlooked there.
Today, I'm still talking with the McDonald work, who's trying to live from these money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal Forum, the comment that the author notes is unresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
Participants of protests started at 6:30 on Thursday at "McDonalda" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, requested that postal and kitchens start to get at least 15 dollars per hour, which is more than twofold of their current minimum salary.
They also requested that the Committee’s organizations be established in the field of concern.
The American laws prohibit the administration to prevent the establishment of committee organizations and to deal with the activists of the committee's movement by shaking and release.
On the other hand, the administration of the people often makes life easier.
However, the establishment of the committee's committee is complicated from objective parts.
One of the main staff is usually high fluctuation of employees.
Incompatible
This day, a number of other leaving restaurants of Manhattan also occurred.
The exhibition of this action was in the summer meeting at "McDonald" near Times Square, where several local democratic policies, especially the member of the town Council of Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald" says he sells billion portions and then doesn't pay you a lot for your honest work!"
Demonstrants also expected support for other prominent non-Work democrats, such as the candidate at the age of Billa de Blasio, who said, "We must go together to support the work of fixfoods in order to achieve just recompenses for their work and economic prosperity, which everyone deserves!"
As the New York Times journal described, it was the biggest action of his kind in the American Sfera of Race.
But it was only a few hundred people, even though not all of them were employees of an affair that worked in New York for tens of thousands of people.
Whether this event will become an insurance that will burn the flame of mass movement is still unexpected.
"It's the brain that's going to cry in the middle of the brain."
In the middle of the fans of modern reality, it is an arithmetic topic of enlarged reality; in the last time it means to make the world especially through games.
At the beginning of the year, Google was transferred to its annual workshop and was announced in November that the request for the relevant patent was also provided by Microsoft.
In the conversation with the leader group of interactive 3D in Cambria, Microsoft Sharam Isadim's employees shows that they're already in the past.
It is a prospectual manipulation with spectacular objects in the air with hot hands, the creation of public spaces.
- Please tell us what your research group is doing?
- We care about the interactions of a man with a machine, but at the same time we're trying to move the border of this interaction.
Humanity has yet been inclined in a stage of work with pixels on a full screen, at least sometimes touching the screens with a finger.
We want to look forward to 5-10 years and predict significant changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox console and Kinect filmers - this is a step forward, and at least no Xbox today is on sale without Kinect videos, because it is very interesting for all to manage by gest.
What else's waiting for us in the future?
- Notwithstanding that the Kinect system has made interactions at physical level, very many interactions are still running on a full screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (accepts more quantities of data), but the output flow is not particularly.
We are trying to change this, we work on the three-dimensional display systems based on different projectives.
We need to put the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
However, it is necessary to know not only those around them, but also space around them.
Then we will be able to add the real world of objects in a much more appropriate form.
And in the first row - shit with these stupid helms of reality!
- What do you think of vote control?
That's an archaetic thing, but doesn't it appreciate?
- It can't be considered all - it's a question of privacy because we don't want to inform the finals of our activities and purposes in our environment.
All types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own.
For example, we had a project in which we were thinking about gestures, but not about distressing, but only about such a short, short-speaking.
The Gesta would not take it with a camera of equipment, but with a box that would follow the bone moves and swallows.
He's big yet, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the flash hours.
However, generally, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesto + voice.
- And how?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this limonade powder?
You'll say it and show it simultaneously.
- I'm just talking about it.
- Oh, that's gonna be very complicated.
- So you want to take the guard to adapt to what the machine can or can't?
- It's not necessary, but it's a mutual accuracy.
I think in the near future, we will need to work mainly on the development of new types of films that can be able to identify human reactions.
For example, laser films that provide relatively good deep solutions can be very important.
- If you have to talk about your job with sensors Xbox Kinect, what are your requests for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough solution, deepness, or something else today?
- In the basic case of the present generation - this is what we can reflect in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course it would be good to get 8 megapixels with 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about the megapixels alone, but as the mother and the deep.
In the current view of the matter, all currently inadequate for us are not sufficient - it assigns work to the designers of algorithms.
So we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes but also the Z.
So very important is also the number of photos per second.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flow of 30 photos per second are sincerely spoken a little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch recorder with a setable late processing period of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, with the currently manufactured filmers are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how measured this affects the interaction of man with the machine.
I would have been a very useful equivalent of such equipment in my work, but they have not so much touch, but they have similar photos in a second more.
- And increased number of cameras isn't necessary?
- In the Kinect system, three "camers" are now used, one is in infrared sender and the other - the acceptor of the reflected signal.
And the third camera -- it's actually a running filmer of the visible bar.
This is not used for the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or to worry him because he would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible kinect analogue system, play with the locked camera location and look how it will help to define a three-dimensional position.
- I don't know, Microsoft (from Google) hasn't pre-worked his brilliant publicly.
Do you not think that if it comes to the daily use of the reality that is extended by special brilliants, it's one of the most promised platforms?
- Of course walking and still keeping the smartphone in the lifted hands is not too satisfied, but I think: the strongest variance would be the "over" shape of enlargement of reality when it could be possible on the basis of the platform of clouds to switch anyway from the brilliant to the smartphone, the projection display and further around the doll.
Blyle - this is very personal equipment, in which it is their power (people things you see only), and at the same time weakness - the extensive reality on the basis doesn't allow you to work on local objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with rational holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Starkovi in "Iron Man", but also to the running mortal.
There is one problem that critics often indicate: there is no touch reaction!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers do your group prepare for this call?
In my statements, I often say the extensive reality -- it's the seventh walking back in a mutual interaction between man and machine.
I think the completion of the wheels could be quietly at the eighth floor.
Instead, one of the interesting tricks is used - using the other hand as a certain kind of base for display.
It's incredible to mention shots!
But there are also those who are actually focused on adding the materiality of these "images in the air" - for example, interference of some directional ultrasound papers in a defined point where the finger is located, it causes a massive feeling, but it's still very weak - as if you're fooling on the bridge of your fingers.
There is also a frame on the screen that affects the nervous inflammation in your fingers - also a promised direction.
- You've been trying to deal with the brain?
So he thinks he feels what he seems to feel at the moment he'd feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we're not trying yet.
Here's another challenge to fight still - how to bring a person who is physically in a very tired space to believe that it runs openly, practically in an unnecessary space - we are also working on the concept of running traces (including not such as in clubs), moving platforms, and also huge balls.
Since heavy clothes become a goal, work is still for many years.
That's what it's doing for the reality of such an attractive to researchers -- many things are in perfect starts.
Vkusovsk instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the "Petrohrad predgard" project, updated to the citizens who are in the head are pregards of culture and art.
On the top of the list, the important positions of the Petrohrada scene, whose expenditure exceed the city, are often obliged to recognize in Europe without reaching the Allergy vote.
The new Rosbalt hero is a horrible Creator of Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyrila Miller, a young man who is all dressed in the Red, which you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Soviet Garden, here in the modal holidays and on the verniss.
The images of Cyrila Miller, wherever they are exposed, are attached to the gates of the shoes.
Cyril Miller is one of the pure social and philosophical petroleum reporters, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is the ideaal man of the petroleum pregarde end 80 and beginning 90 years.
Besides being a citizen, his reveal on the streets causes a smile at the face of citizens, he increases all the harvests.
Recently he took the flashnet in his hand and became a petroleum flashnet, because in this complex role, he became a godly life, philosophy, and image.
Cyril, why are you walking this way through the city in the red, not in the yellow or for example in the Turkish?
- I've chosen a red color as a designer who cares about the look and image.
In this world, the red color is a compromise between artists, images and publics.
Maybe it generally applies that everything that is a little different from the green, becomes aggressive and develops bad properties.
But my explosions are inclined to have a conversation.
The whole history of my operational actions is primarily the invitation to discuss.
And when did you understand that you have to be an artist?
- At the building in the Cultural House of New York, where my job was exposed.
I realized my way.
Then I couldn't understand the walls of old free official artists and the new, free types of artists.
I've been friends with the artists of the new walls, with the post-gazoneans who brought us to Pushkins 10 and there were no other walls.
It makes me to divorce, clothes, music, all the genres other than words.
- And all this happened in your art-clinic ...- It was important for me to feel in the center of the culture of Petterburk, where all the best powers of creativity should be saved.
In 1995, I planted a place in Puskin 10, and there was a music-art club, a godly club, a home of Peterburk gods before reconstruction.
There were many:NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Snura brought up with the "Ucho Van Gogh" project.
Snur and his friends sing under a sing of light songs, dressed in a low triangle, u ́ among them Igor Vdovin, which is now in mode.
When the cab started playing alive, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg has conducted many hali-Gali-Galib time programs.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and he started his big career, basic education, and professional preparation from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Gribojedov" club, this is the art Clinic's sound.
Our workers and constant guests went out here.
I'm a hero of the past centuries when the culture did something else mean.
In 2000, an investigation was organized in printing, the special price was "People in our city".
In the name "A year Artist" I was named, so my top ended.
In new times, according to the old rules, work is unfair, I am a man of truth, honour and culture of the past century.
In the current years, it is easier to get ≥arm, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be →arm, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristics in a different way.
- Many of my images - these are the hits in which life is captured by the actuality and persuasion.
I'll have the "Russian Museum in clones".
The clowns are a overtime category.
I was a community before, being such is painful and terrified today.
But in the clowns, it's all shitting, it's tragic.
I love magic, I have big ideas.
For example, to save the world by the way of totality rearrangement in the row of the driving.
Today people meet by clothing, oriented on external mechanism, not on internal person.
Or maybe he can't give him his hand and he needs to go into his face.
And the clothes will be removed by overlapping.
We've seen you recently in the town flashing. The cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should eat if not me?
- And may commercial art be beautiful?
- Currently, commercial, useful arts should be reasonable, tactful, sweet.
Cultural disappearance occurs.
Earlier, people were stumbled in fools, they loved one, one, another.
Everything has been broken up today, and it's very hard to enjoy everyone today.
I'm not a centurion banker to like everyone.
Today, you need to think about who you like.
Today every cultural hero has his 100 fans.
- And the stass of Michael's will come for a few thousand birds!
- His fans will come on, there's a sexy social square.
And there will be 300 people on cultural ground, and 10 thousand will not come, and research is less management, money, everything is worthwhile.
I've got a fans, the main is that no one's discovering it, and he's not breaking what's safe.
When I was young, I painted pictures that were on the wall with Falke and Larion at one collector.
I started with the pictures that people's going to end.
Today people are often aware of the ideas.
They say:Culture of spirit, culture of consumption.
There's no culture in need, it's elsewhere.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for drawing images.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what's missing in Petterburk?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: a factor through culture.
Not everyone of them can take care of culture.
In the time of a number of cars, it was not all that, the cars may have not understanded the culture, but they realized that it was necessary to support professionals.
Today, in Moscow, there are good conservants.
We have people in Petrohrada who could be professionals, but they are a destruction somewhere in the corner, because they need greater experts who correctly appreciate these professionals and lead them on the right way.
Today, it's a pleasure.
That's Erarta, but it's different that they sincerely say that we accept not all modern arts, there are artists who should search for other museums.
- What do you think of Petterburk?
- Petterburk - it's not the main city of culture, there's a much more culture in Moscow, there's the right ground.
And on our ears, art's kind of awesome.
We need cultural ground, but we have more writers than readers today, that's wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people who are scientists who go to exhibitions.
We've just got such a weak layer.
We need art to become a modern matter, as it was at the beginning of the past century.
The project is implemented for the grant of St.Peterburk
Rotate in the universe
The land is in danger.
Global heating or collapsing with a murderous asteroid.
The caravanes of space ships with grounds on the ground are released on the road, look for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the main question is: How can we maintain our family in the subjects of unfortunateness or on the given replacement plane?
I think the choice is no big.
There are only two planets that can be won, even if only hypothetics.
"It's Venushe and Mars," says the highly established worker of the State Astronomical Institute P. K. Sternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
However, while there are better submissions for life at Mars, at the surface of Venus, 500 degrees Celsia are reached.
Life there may only be in a big height or in the Venezuela or in the universe.
To resolve the issues of reproduction in the universe, people started with a flower.
A half centuries ago, plant trials were performed.
Four generations of games developed on the road are nothing different from their earthly family.
Then there was an exhibition of smoke on the orbit - very small fruit man Drosoela.
In 1979, a green sheep was sent to the universe, and they checked how emo is developed in the state of unfortunateness.
We get absolutely normal birds on the output.
But then the problems start.
"The problem is that this bird has to find opposite, must stand on his own feet and start moving," says the leader of the Institute of Bio Medical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
They don't find the opposite, the chaotic birds fall and make a cocktail.
After 10 hours, the fresh-skined birds came to the entire instinct.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trial was that they were just lost in four days.
"Two times we let the birds go out, but then we refused it, because it is just impossible to work with them," comments the failure of experiments with the wheels in the Universe Vladimir Syčev.
The last "miniarch" of animals was flying on both roads 16 years ago.
In 2013, experiments will continue.
In the "Bion" biosatellite, but they will only be the beings of a single gentlemen.
He went through experiments with visits who were sent to the universe already pregnant.
In fact, they didn't discover anything overnatural.
"It was just on biosatelites, but again -- it's a single experiment, and such trials must be performed," says Vladimir Syčev.
After the earth’s arrival, the world’s meetings were born a seed.
However, it has not yet been possible to draw close to the problem of multiplying directly in the universe.
It's a hard job.
Life in the loss of life-conduction can simply not carry out their sex instinct.
Man, in turn from animals, can in principle.
Homo ́ens rules with abstract thoughts and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
It does not prove similar experiments from ethics.
But women are flying into the universe for 50 years.
The biggest danger threatened Turkish.
The most precious thing that mankind has is the female body.
Our Chuck was flying, and no one on Earth could say if he'd keep flying into the universe.
Whether he can be born a child after that year.
"Where no one has answered this question yet," says the veterinarian of Vachtang Vajde.
In June 1964, more than a year after a year to the universe, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tyres' daughter was born.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolajev.
In 1988, a son of the second-cosmonaut of the Sweet Savica was born, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in the opened universe.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts that have been born in long years and growing health of the seed.
"In addition, it may be dangerous even in orbital years," says the Cosmonaut-pilot, the Herd of the Soviet Union and the Russian Valerij Poljakov.
Nevertheless, people must unrepentantly search for new paths in bio, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaborator is the obligation to prepare for aeroplane.
Here, in subjects with zero attractiveness, cosmon’s habits are gained for work in the opened universe.
The water imitates the state of unfortunateness.
Maybe the water is a pleasure for adults, but in my way amazing, for small children it's a natural food.
Small Impathyanders seem to be confirmed that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a relationship between that the child is located in a middle of 9 months in the mother’s fruitwater and then it is easier for them to get water.
In principle, it's logical because from the time of birth, from the time of the first confidence, they're going to pass only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget the child something," says Marina Aksenov's instructor of the newborn.
Stringly said - if the status of a newborn child is more natural, then for women it is more natural inevitable gravity, an attractive force.
In the state of unfortunateness, it is very important for the creaming of brushes, the masters, the decreasing ability of the body to put forth the fruit.
We can leave this on the side if the stimulators of the whistle activity at birth will work.
The end of the end is possible to be born in a special room in which the mother’s body puts forth fruit.
"And what else?" asked Valerie Poljakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the child is also a artistic gravity.
It is not able to form the coast or the system of weights properly to affect the earthly attractiveness of the organism.
The newborn on the current road is not possible to be clothed as adult in a special clothing with a burden to train.
It'll just be saved from what to his development without support.
"When we go with you to an experiment that allows the child to be born in a foreign Property, we bring a healthyly affected person on the Earth, which will be completely unproportionated to the current Property," predicts the IBMP RAN Igor Pest bioetics committee.
So the divorce of children in the universe is just a theoretical question today.
Once, however, the time will come when the earthquake will become reality and when the earthquake will be issued in their ships on a remote planet, which will become the house of their descendants born in the universe.
Boss of NKU: Control of Swarcs misleaded political wines
Czechland has good control and quality legislation in relation to public prohibitions, but it is in its position.
In a discussion for the present.ch, this says Vice-President of the Highest Control Office of Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right of his own - that's what we have missed according to my opinion," comments currently Kala.
Similar conclusions also indicate the common control of the Czech and German controllers.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter sometimes refers to the "shvarcs".
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the ODS of the businessman to charge his controls - is then prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be strictly set out, and if something is prohibited, neither the President of the Government can prevent the operation of the office that has the obligation to be able to control and defeat obligations," Kala states.
At the Meeting of the Control Committee in the Mission, you have promptly spoken of a joint project between the Czech and the German party, which was compared with legislation on public prohibitions in both countries.
What exactly happened?
It's the parallel control we started about two years ago.
It is simply said that the European legislation is adjusting the way of resolving public prohibitions, followed by individual national legislation, and then on the same practice.
We have given all this to the end, and even though the control is not yet finished, we have shown very interesting differences -- we have generally said legislation may also be "appropriate and perfecter" but the same practice is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more accurate rules, but it is necessary to make rights themselves.
What, in fact, can this project help you, what will result from it for you?
Just such a common control could contribute to it, and they stopped to make efforts to determine laws, reduction and enforcement of limits if it does not have such a positive impact.
Hospitality means obtaining the relevant thing for a reasonable (which but does not mean the lowest) price to distort the riches and, where appropriate, the criminal action.
But by decreasing the limit of the prohibition, we don't have to achieve it necessary.
Maybe this system will be paid to such a quantity of "paper", that those in this system want to search for pipes, so they will get much easier than if the limit remains higher.
You are talking about foreign problems with the translation of legislation on public prohibitions to practice.
How does the German control system work?
Is the office here like our NKU, or is it differently set up?
As regards the offices, as well as the NKU works there, Bundeshof, who is organized like us, is also a college, just being created in a little different way, but in principle, both of the authorities are acting in a range.
The powers are also subject to a certain degree, but the fact that Germany has social arrangements, such as these annual courts, and at the level of individual social countries - this system is a little distinguished from our.
BRH can only control social money, represented by the state.
The public centres governed by countries and foreigns are controlled there from the level of social courts.
What about more legislation, so that is easier than ours?
Generally, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some ways Germany is marked as a pattern, but it cannot be said that it is better in everything.
So, is that even having better controls?
I'm sure that's not, but I'm saying again, I don't have such a comparison.
But it must be said that even the countries we consider as a pattern are faced with a number of problems.
Otherwise, there would be no benefit to cooperate with our office, right?
What about foreign legislation, which the new law on public prohibitions for your office, has already shown its impact?
Since the period of validity of this news is relatively short, we are still not in control action.
Because we're doing ex post controls, it's necessary to calculate with a certain delay.
We have noted this only in the future control process - we have started our new tool for "detecting risks of disabilities" through which we have already made 14 thousand public prohibitions, and we have analysed them - these changes will be clearly shown, because the limits, some types of choice management are adjusted and similar.
So, do you think that the approval of this law is more than a profit or a further burden of the burocracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can be found here is that it's the rules "made" and wherever it can be.
For the purposes of the previous rules, controlled persons are committed by the provider (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to ensure that any lack of law on public prohibitions means a violation of the budget penalty.
So the price of the law is that way to decrease?
I don't think that way.
The system needs to exclude those who want to attack and use him, and not to disturb those who are allowing formal doubts that have no effect on decisions.
This system will only create a higher pressure on birocracy.
So how do you get out of that?
Let's show us where the way doesn't go.
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the ODS of the undertaking was to be forced by the controls of that "swarcs" - and what does that mean?
Svarcs'em is prohibited or allowed?
The law must be strictly established, and if something is prohibited, neither the president of the Government can prevent the operation of the office that is responsible for control and demand.
He can say, "We change the law and let it be," but he can't say that we're going to do as nothing.
In the law on public prohibitions, there are relatively serious rules on how formally it should be implemented - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when the interester with the best offer is sold only for formal failures.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right of his own -- that's what we miss, according to my opinion.
The roads are shooting places, mostly but seats
In some places, the Czech Republic has the roads swimming and snipped.
But most of them are driving, somewhere increasingly careful.
Carlovarski country
Today, in the Carlovarian country, the streets have been located, but they have been shot and snipped.
The temperature fell between five and ten degrees under zero, but during the day it must be quietly heated.
The destruction in the region has stopped and is only a weak layer in the lower.
However, on the Mount Mountains, there are about 30 meters of snow.
The sites were also less visible because of milk, resulting from the data of national travellers.
The R6 speeds and the first class communications are now located in the region without restriction.
However, caution is at the place, for example, on some transfusions, where the surface can be frozen and crazy.
All roads of the other and third classes are also assembled in the mountain roads.
But in some areas there are still the rest of the frozen and the places of the snow.
Moreover in the higher positions it is necessary to increase attention to the driving.
Pardubian and Royal Great Country
On some roads in the East Czech, it threatens the winter, the higher positions and the mountains can be a snow level on the communicators, informs on its sides the Road Management of Roads and Distances.
Travellers warn drivers before wearing, can be created in particular in the higher positions of Pardubian country.
The disaster may be in the area of Lanschkroun, the Oast over Orlicia, Policky, Svitav or High Myt, especially on the roads of other and third classes.
Chemicals are treated by I/43 and I/34 in Svitav.
The snow is mainly on the streets in the Crkoness and the Orlical Mountains.
The captured snow layer is in the highest positions of the streets during the periods of Rychnov above the Prince and Trutnov.
In the Eastern Czechs, most often, it's more than sealous.
The temperatures move the habit between minus three and plus one degree Celsia, a flat weak wind.
Country of Pleasing
The roads in the Pleasing country are now remote, but places with increased care and driving are necessary to adjust the weather.
It's fresh, the temperatures move between three and nine degrees under the frozen point.
After the previous destruction and the following refrigeration, some communications may be swimming.
Places must also calculate the drivers with milk, but the visibility will be gradually improved.
It comes from the information of the deficiency of national travellers.
The distant D5 is a remote team without restriction, however, increased caution is recommended by communicating managers between 80 and 131 km.
Most of the roads of the first class have the surface dry and frozen.
On the south of Plzenica and Tahovic, but there may be screening insects.
Communications of the second and third classes are low and are also subject to warning on swimming intervals.
The drivers should be careful primarily on less frequency travels in Shumava.
Olomouck country
With snow coasts on the street, they must count drivers in the highest positions of the Olomouck country today.
She stayed on the Red Horse seat and on the road toward Videlski cross.
The travelers to the territory were exhausted at the night of the dining, and, according to the travel managers, about three centimeters of Sumper.
In the remaining parts of the country, carriers have a seat without restriction.
"It's on Shumpersk in the highest positions of the rest of snow.
With the snow cash on the Red Mountain, the drivers must count in the direction of Jesenic," said the CTC Division of the Shummer Road Management today.
In the territory of the night, their colleagues to Jesenic, roads to the highest positions are now according to them after chemical treatment of hole and milk.
On Olomo ́ku, the streets are located without restriction, but the drivers should be watched in forest areas where the vehicles have remained low.
East country, Libereck country
Soon a few hard places are reporting today after I'll get a traveler in the north of Czech.
Furthermore, some places with an attacked snow or with the ice is also closed by the forest road from Telnice to the Kninica in Usteck, which comes from the police database.
The temperatures are also maintained under zero positions, so ice and snow are obviously holding on the streets.In the lowers, especially south-east from the Czech Mediterranean, however, no problems are and the roads are actually dry.
Transport complications are not reported yet.
The exhibition of the renal reports to the travellers, especially from the surrounding.
According to the orologists for her, the night were ideal submins - over the day of rain and deadness, night and frog.
The main travels are reported on the street I/13 at the border of the Ustech and Libereco country.
The closure from Telnice to the Kninic has been provoked by the remote trees that were burned under snow to the carrier.
Simon Ornest: On the concerts we want to fix energy positions
What do you think he's gonna get the end of the world in a month?
It's just one of the other crazy reports that people's going to catch.
Along with the The Tap Tap, we do more fun and we say that we are the only capelle in the world that can save enough energy position, and we have removed or defended the end of the world.
Moreover, you are organizing a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present it to the readers closer?
It's a national benefit action we've planned for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the magic calendar reported on 21st at 11:10 afternoon.
The 20th day before the 21th hour ago, 3 concerts of consequences in Prague, Brna and Ostrava have been simultaneously performed.
They will end about the time when the Maya calendar ends on the Kiribati island in the Pacific, which is in the timeline at 12 hours before us.
Who came with this idea?
I think that was my idea, then we've been thinking about everything together with our Honzo August Creator.
Besides that we want to reduce enough energy position and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the situation of this world once to transfer our children to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we also created a unique collection of items of boots, tricks, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing on www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap group, together with other interpreters, also sang a so-called himna against the end of the world, named "The End of the World has been canceled".
She's very favorable at YouTube today, is she also on these beneficial concerts?
Of course, and in the complete conclusion, so if we do all, and the end of the world isn't going to happen...
All interpreters will call her on all three concerts simultaneously.
The hymns are also subsequently in a unique direct transportation to the Czech TV.
The word to this song wrote and the main role of Jesus in the clip plays Tomás Hanak, also sang Xindl X...
How did you work with them?
We also cooperate with other characteristics of the Czech culture scene, since we arrange a lot of benefits and concerts...
We strive to engage them intensely in these projects.
We showed that most of them were interested and enjoyed in cooperation with us.
What's going on with the outcome of concerts against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the non-barrier educational centre of Studeo, we have been conducted for six years with the Tap civil association in the Jedlik Constitution.
For Jedlik's school students, lectors are regularly interested in the activities they enjoy and interest.
The students alone do not have the opportunity to publish themselves as readers, so we are trying to enable them in this way.
In the context of the delivery of the Jedlic Constitution in the future, the private buildings will be made available to the project.
There will be several music groups and interpreters on each concert.
What's your choice?
We tried to set up a program that will celebrate all generations of children.
For example, in Prague, China, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bartou, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Searchy.
For more details, see www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning similar "bomb action" and in the future?
In May, we'll start on the Prague Jar, so here we'll certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting hosts.
In the next year, they also played in the Czech National House in New York, and I, personally, if we are in the United States, would also connect it to the outcome in Washington and Chicago.
Your forest plans are not minimalistic, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group that makes people's handicapped.
How do you handle these paths logistics and organized?
It's not so terrifying as it looks at the first look.
We have five members on the electric vehicle, its vehicles have to travel in the binding space, we are, of course, putting a large quantity of costs and bearing with a tool...
However, since it happened without problems, the CSA and British Airways were very ready for us that I had been surprised for many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.
Thanks to the outcome to the coach, you can compare the individual differences in the freedom, public access to the handicapped and similarly.
Which one you've met yet?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we were just in Russia witnesses that everything is still at the east.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is very barrier, here is still unusual to move a man on the electric vehicle himself in the city center.
It doesn't pay any evidence there, like the drivers may give you a priority in exhaustion.
Unfortunately, there are citizens who are trying to warn people's problems.
In contrast, what must we still achieve the growing country?
There's something we're still behind...
It is important, however, to mention that perfection and improvement depends on the efforts of people that are concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is fully running that even people with a hard handicap can move to the public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum wherever...
But it is not very habitual that a large number of people there would have reached the social life actively, in contrast with the Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect of publicity or unbarriership is one thing, but only until we will be important sporters, artists, herds, politicians or lawyers, so things will be going to change really.
Still, it's the only cases of people who have a strong cause.
The Tap Tap is currently very important, but let's go back for a couple of years from what you were allowed to put it in 1998?
I went to Jedlik's Constitution as a student, where I had many young people around me who had an interest in something.
And since I'm a musician, I'm playing a saxophone outside, I've found a interesting music circle together with my colleague.
Well, in the course of our time, as our Moderator Lady Angelovič says, it was a little out of the hand (Laughter).
But the popularity has come to the last years, or I'm wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started associating with known songs and also actively working on the promotion of the cup.
We realized that work that doesn't see, basically, doesn't exist.
In addition, thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can allow quality readers, equipment and so further.
Was your goal to reach the Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something else.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one imitates the other.
It's logical in its way, everything new is taken carefully and it's still.
The things that are unique are very little, but I'm trying to claim that Tap Tap are one of them.
With the idea of a man who first sees us, it's, of course, sorry, it's natural...
But this feeling is totally inevitable, because people with a handicap are not suffering from all the beings we have to suffer.
They are people who can live a full - valued life and develop, of course, because they have the need for this.
I say, if something happens to people with a handicapped, it's not just a move for them, but for the whole company.
This success has also helped you to be a heavy boss, how many people mentioned you?
If we want to do quality work, we must be incompatible in many things and require a certain discipline.
But I think it's totally normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic presentation and a head in clouds, and if they find out that they have to go to the test two times weeks, to affect the preparation and to spy a lot of time on the roads to the concerts, it'll leave the surprise.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group who wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap has now twenty members.
How many of them were at her starts in 1998?
Only the only Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people's getting away, and they're coming, they can't be prevented.
Who has the cause and the pleasure, has the door open with us.
Successful day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
Running in Prague Incheba Arena, Brne Fléda and Island of Galynese 12 capsules and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three towns will come to the end of the evening by the telemost at the common song of the cup The Tap Tap "The end of the world has been canceled"
The objective of the concert is to store the financial facilities for the multi-barrier educational center of STUDEO at the Adelistic Constitution in Prague in 25 million Kč
Incoming to the concert is 400 Kč, children up to 12 years have free entry into the pre-seal Bohemiaticket
Polish and space.
The European Space Agency has been adopted at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Economic Agency last week as a member of this European Space Agency as a second country from the former East Block country (after the Czech Republic, which became a full-valuable member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of Agency's projects during the next years.
Of course, the way of Poland to the cosmos has started a long time ago.
During the flights in the cosme, the Poland supervised before the second world war; but they did not meet the understanding.
For example, I will note A. Sternfeld's advice in the Warsaw Astronomical Observator, who represented ideas from his crowd work Income to Cosmon’a.
The ideas of the young engineer (No. 1905) left the listeners cold and after the years, Sternfeld insisted that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld obtained the price of Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirscha.
The mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a great propagator of astronomy and cosmonic.
In the Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books by these disciplines.
Gadomski became a worldwide known propagator of the cosmonic, and his benefit was also assessed by the name of one of the corners on the reverse side of the month.
In 1925, a rail tree was built in Poland, which was to be cared of the racket engine.
Unfortunately, the author is not known and the project's details are not known.
It does not even mean whether the racket should be used for the dilution of the grass or for the inflammation of it.
The information on this box is only known from the time pressure.
Since 1933, racket shots began to collect the Polish workshop.
The Cell Techniki Weapons was ensuring the victoriacy in collaboration with Professor Wolfke and Professor Gustav Mokrickie.
From the injected materials, it is evident that the research has reached practical tests.
However, German army's arrival was cancelled.
In 1937, in a professional pressure, the photo-electric rackets, proposed by the engineer Rohoziński, and the next year the work of Raketa - torpeda after ́na and raketobomba of the aircraft of Lelivy-Kriwoblock.
Both projects were designed for military use of raket engines.
Shortly before war, all projects of military use of raket technology have been conducted by the Temporary Advisory and Scientific Advisory Committee, which has coordinated all works.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of action, his activity ended the start of war.
Other worked cosmons are discovered by the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Poland Astronautic Society).
First, the change of the company in November 1954’s issue of the issue of the problem, in which four of the most comprehensive articles are astronized.
One of them, from Professor Subotoviče, has been proposed to create a company that will be concerned with cosmon’a.
At that time, projects of artificial partners have already been spread and it was expected that space research is a perspective.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) has tried to enter the International Astronautic Federation (based on 1951) and has already become a good member of the PTA.
And in the next year, the first President of PTA Kazimeter Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became the president of the International Astronautic Federation.
This was standing until he died in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has contributed significantly to the development of a very successful RM-orological racket (Raqueta Meteorologica), which became the first Polish racket conducted by a research.
The type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was reached on 10 October 1958 to the first start.
The racket with access of 1800 metres was a length of about 80 cm and its weight was increasingly 5 kg.
After the construction of a perfect version of RM-1A and in 1959, the aeroplane test RM-2 was started in the Bledov desert.
The racket was 1,4 meters long and its weight was about 11,5 kg.
Another type of development should already be able to work - the RM-34 raket had access to 14,5 km and its task was to follow the highest.
In 1962, however, further development was stopped.
The leader of the first RM rackets became the meteor-1 raket developed in 1962 to 1965.
The racket was designed as a double-degree, its total length was 510 cm and the weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which were different from the size of the space for decked devices.
In the meteor-1A racket, there was a range of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum access to all three types was 37 km.
During the year 1965 to 1968, he conducted the development of the Meteor-2 race in the Aviation Institute, whose first flying tests started in October 1970.
Raketa Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry out a beneficial weight weight of 10 kg to about 60 km.
The following versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is still necessary to mention the entrance of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the CoSPAR National Committee for two years later.
Poland also participated in the Interkosmos programme in the research of the Space Space in Soviet artistic associations, and in 1978 the Poland pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became one of the other intercosmonautes after Vladimir.
The cancellation of the public payment law is not a solution.
In the last week, the Constitutional Court of Justice for Public Services has cancelled.
The resolution led to a living debate on the public.
In fact, it will be interesting to look at the issue of a broader view.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU are based on the principle of more, unregulated economic competition.
In its effect, it means that individual economic developments, national economic systems, are in constant conflict.
This is the principle of free trade and freedom, and I have no unlimited movement of privacy together with an unlimited financial speculation.
The impact of significant prices in the price of work (measures) results in price pressure.
In this regard, it is necessary to understand the situation when the producer is trying to remain in the economic competition by "decreasing" the price of the competitor with a view to enhancing the market share and thus increaseing its own profits.
In a mass measure, it means to translate the production into an alien, or to buy or disappear.There is high unemployment in countries where the prices of work are compared to other economics high.
Since the privacy has no social responsibility and also the responsibility for the unemployment produced by it, the social expenditure of the State is necessary.
In the whole of this, it strengthens the full demand of businessmen to pay taxes and thus replace economic and social damage that he has in the moon for winning.
The situation is so well known that specific statistical data should not be indicated.
With regard to private practices, individual economic practices are created when the governments of individual countries are required to enter into a mutual competition with a view to reducing the social level of their own population in order to join the country of strangers.
In other words, governments give to the private population all their own people, without prejudice to social disaster.
This is particularly shown in the changes in laws.
The objective is to encourage the own population to adopt a price dictator of private dictators, particularly in the midst of the midst.
However, this is the system of economic contributions in the case of unemployment, but the limitation of the rights of employees in the right of work.
The outcome is the growing poverty together with the growth of divisions between poor and rich.
In the SRN there are a number of years of public food benefits for poor people who cannot enjoy their own work.
The beginning of these people goes to millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, it is fully running to cases that properly employed people are able to pay the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of assisting social workers.
The sustainable measures of the practice of all southern EU states are absolutely leading to the same situation when people under the pressure of a disasteral disaster level are forced to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to live for cold payments on the surface of the company in order that a private investment will be once in the country.
Here you need to ask, but where will he come from?
If it is from other EU countries, poverty moves from one country to another, or it will not come at all because China, India, Brazil, or Turkish, Marokkanic, or Egyptian, or African still works for a breach of European recompense.
That's about the whole Latin America.
Liberal theory and media in the campaign claim that the state cannot reach at its own economy that the management of the economy leads to economic disaster.
The privacy continues to note that the State should not be governed by the principles of economy.
Then it is necessary to ask whether the privacy does not affect it, it is actually running the policy, and that is, in its own sense, the whole state.
Here's a unique answer, yes.
The evidence is the existence of practical practices and in all states all the lobbys.
The result is a disappointment of corruption, the provision of mutual advantages, legislation, where practically everything is criminal, but nothing penalty.
In the SRN, the State Ministry for the Lack of Financial Affairs provides for the development of laws to private legal firms that are deteriorated in the connection with industrial.
These laws are then agreed in Bundestagu.
All such powers are not from the people as the constitutions of the Western type, but from the financially strong groups of preferred own interests.
It is obvious that the liberally oriented democracy is now sufficient to the description of Appiános in its part of the Crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeia:" State was already in full division and the authorities were conceived by violence.
For taxes, illegally obtained nicely and using stones or swords.
Subloyalty and corruption were begotten without any prejudice, and the people went to elections with the previously sold voice "..."Caracter people did not take the authority at all, so once it was a state of eight months without conjunction." . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The conclusion Like in the past, the current company is based on an independent preferential of its own benefit, without prejudice to global interest.
The privacy is no longer capable of understanding and applying the whole community benefits.
The outcome is now, as at the same time, an unexpected decade to elimine without any effort to reform the deepest.
We therefore need to search for the cousin of the fascist and communist regimes in the independent liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th century.
The current state of these systems can be considered the democracy of the liberal type as a certain stop waiting for another road.
In particular, the disaster is that current elites are fully ignoring in the future possible statistical losses of lives, humanitarian and social disasters, which we are now witnesses together with crimes against humanity, as known by old and new people.
The abrogation of the public payment law is not a solution, at least not a sustainable solution.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international and intra-European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to look for ways to decrease the social level of population.
So this trend is systemic.
The solution is the objective of political and social reforms that enhance the economy of the State, enhance the impact of citizens on the government and weak the monopole position of the privacy in the company in the benefits of the State.
Israel: Laborator of chaos.
"The violation doesn't come and can't never" Sting in the Fragile song whose main verse in the refrigerator is "Let's not look like we're crying"
"When my sons didn't want wars, there would be no" dead Gutel Schnaper, Major Amschela Rothschild's wife in 1849
After the last wall of the Israelites and Gaza’s song, the reactions have occurred.
One stands for Israel, arguments his right to self-defence, and the Palestinians are coherent with the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguments the racist of Israel, the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and the Israelian state corresponds to the role of the terrorist state.
I don't want to think of who is in periodic periods of repeated whales killing a victory and who victims, finally, today's people of Israel were born in a very self-right territory in the current political situation and the beginning of violence.
I am about to offer the readers a view of the opon, a view of who has served primarily 95 years of pressure (recovered by Balfourovacation in November 1917) on the small-country country of the Mediterranean.
Some of my views are supported by the available history facts some of them are carried out based on my own understanding of who the group of people is the main hybatler of modern history.
Humanity's actions are in the first range of power forces.
In each epoch, we can watch the Great Alexandro or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether they were these persons who were fully self-controlled, or whether somebody was standing behind their throne, who directed their actions to the outlined goal.
We must admit that we live in the time when the world riches are concentrated in the hands of some individuals and that money and powers of them could not be reached for life of a generation.
Among these astronomic rich families, one grows that could be considered a head of a bottle (if anyone still stands over them, but I don't exclude it) - Rothschields.
It doesn't write much about them.
It's understanding.
In the 19th century, they bought the press agency (Reʹns) already in the 19th century to stop the connection with their name with the higher criminal effects in which they stood and for which they represented a strengthening, multiplication of wealth or both.
They have major shares in all central banks of the world and against countries where they share in the central area are not leading or preparing wars (before the attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after Iraq's attack it was 5 countries, only four, but Russia was subjected to the Central Bank of the Russian Government).
Whoever tried to take this family, he died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank Rothschield Bank of America, began to spending their own (intelligence of government) money and was killed in 1865 in the divadle.
JFK started spending his own money and wanted to cancel the FED, killed in 1963, Mr. Louis McFadden was killed in 1936 after he wanted to demand the FED to deploy the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate the plan of three world wars by the highest builder, 33th degree of dedication to Albert Pike.
The war had to remove great monarchist public totals in Europe, the second had to remove the colonial government, namely the Great Britain, and the third, to reduce the world population somewhere to 0.5 to 1 billion people (this quantity of slaves for their pleasure and luxus suffices and unnecessful so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing other than the preference for such solutions) and the final overtake of the absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families in the head of Rothschieldy is to call for a crisis and the following solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
However, these solutions are false and lead to deterioration (see the FED record so that they do not repeat the crisis as that they have been called in 1907).
So after they had been able to kill the hamburger's successor R-U of the Throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo to destroy the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Emperor by launching Bolivia's revolution.
During the World War, the soldiers and economically unrepresented, Germany (not needed for the Destruction of the Caribbean Russia) ended, and thereafter the development of the Central European Power, Russian Uherska.
For easier deployment of the Second World War, the politicians have allowed the political banks to create a lack of conflict by providing to Germany great war reparations, which have created a prejudice to radicalization of pollutant meat, and thereafter they have only been enough to support Germans enough, vineyards indicating and simple solutions to the leader's offering and further creating a multinational Czech Republic with a strong minority that had to be very much, and also the fifth columns, by encouraging the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschields supported Zioni Sticky Movies, whose age tried to create a Jewish state, preferably in the history of Judah with Jerusalem coby the main city (return to Zion).
The Balfour's already mentioned Action has created a precept for the immigration of Jews to Palestine, which began to be influenced by the first places with local Arabians.
The terrorist attacks affected both sides.
The Second World War was exposed to whether Hitler was thrown out of the row that the international bankiers first held it, or what he had done in the plan was difficult to consider, each of the suffering of the European Jews in concentrations created a precept for the acceptance of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and as the war reparation of Germany was made on the second World War, the declaration of the State of Israel was made a fire of the Third War.
If international bankers are able to discover it, the Jewish nation, like in the second, will be victims in the first line of battle, now together with the Arabic or general Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is as an amazing laborer, a source of severity and chaos, not only in the land, but also in a international measure (will only take the way people are divided into the hosts and the opposers of Israel).
Who is the vineyard, and who is the victim of the Palestinian - Israelian conflict, where the wrath produces a mistake in an incredible string, when at the beginning of all, the charity of individuals and their desires of global power?
Here is the need to distinguish the simple people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankiers underscore people's choices exclusively their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel of Netanyah is a typical example of fashioning, to international loyal bankers, a policy that does all to resolve war with Iran, which, due to the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatened the crossing in the global conflict and the control of Iran over Hormuz, which travels 20% of the world's roof (flying corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the world economy.
In what light is now manifested the words David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we believe is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world rule in their presence is the world of gentlemen and slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population is served enjoys financial aristocracy.
The world where each newborn unit is implanted in the birth of a chip, which is fully controlled.
"And it makes all the small and big, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on the right hand or on the head of the poor, so that he cannot buy or sell who is not marked by the name of the beast or the number of its name.
That's what you need to understand: who has a sense to count the numbers of the beast.
This number represents a man, and it's the number six hundred sixty-six."
Film Argo: When it's worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, he appointed the demonstrative Islamic students of the American Ambassador in Teheran and took 52 diplomates as a handicap.
They had to be released to be a exchange for the Mohameda Rezu of Páhlavi, who, after revolution, passed into the United States, who were a patron of his regime after a few decades.
For the US administration, she didn't propose a position on the east - to walk a screen through the palub could not allow her because it would generally threaten her confidence in associates in other countries.
The release of the hands, but in Iran, where the revolution was in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not able to achieve.
It was for the prestigiation of the United States, which has yet been prompted by the phyasic attempt to free hands with power.
The diplomatic prisons were finally released after 444 days after the negotiation of the Algerian Government.
Their share in the house has chosen a wall of solidarity and an anti-Iranic feeling.
Debakl in Iran contributed expressly to Jimmy Carter's breath with Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections of 1980.
The film of Ben Affleck Argo's directoral herd describes one episode of the story that America brought a small victory.
Shortly before the ambassador was thrown out of her six employees.
After the complicated peripheries, they ended in the residence of the Canadian village.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, it was possible to get them from Iran, helping an extravagant crossing story - they moved to Canadian passports as members of the film schedule that looked at the location of the sci-fi bigofilm.
Genre Combination
The plan that he invented for "exfiltration" Tony Mendez required to cooperate with Hollywood.
In order to be worthless, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, printing, ficticial production company had a real office.
The details of the operations have been funded for a time, the film comes from Tony Mendez.
Afflet's film is a special combination of more genres.
On one side realisticly captured political thriller, e.g. "caper movie", the story of the shot, the substrate - may be an example of Danny's series of partners.
In the movie, the injury - on the one hand of the documentary sequence of the Teheran (the title sequence shows the iconic times photos of events and the way that the same events were introduced in the movie - great differences in it are not).
On the other hand, the passport from Hollywood, negotiated with ironie and a mild coverage.
And then scenes from the center and other institutions -- men in the coasts are broken down in the workshops, at the boards of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck was able to restart the career in a career.
From the ridiculed herd, he became a respected register, and his heritage also stopped to be an ironic note.
Argo is his third whole evening film, after the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the City thriller (2010).
Besides, it's the first Afflect's photo that doesn't be played in Boston's household.
At the same time, the feeling of the atmosphere was among the characteristics that the directors of older films highlighted above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows him in the Argo, where Teheran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the movie are played in the streets, when rebuilding events - the introductory sequence of the ambassador's fall is effective in its transparency, which, rather, affects the emotions of the fraud and inappropriacy that occurs when somebody is cleaned.
Similarly, Affleck and his collaboration are achieved in the scenes of thoughts (false chamber on the Teheran base).
Too many places too many
The Regisseur also had to arrange with that the reported story does not actually offer much in the sense of the movie scenes.
It's almost successfully working with this, sometimes thinking about reality - there's no longer so elegant (the scene in which the threatening crisis on the Teheran aircraft turns the phone back in America and the honey after the random effects enough attached to the hair).
The weak Arga, however, is the dilution that results from the need to show too many places too many.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in the roles of Hollywood's co-operation, although their positions would have been more space and they were not only in this movie.
Afflect's movie is so little loss of dramatic tach, it is a picture that can be followed with a mild interest, assessing the performance and retro-evolving thrillery 70s.
But it's just hard.
Like one way of living history and the evidence of the overcoming ideas of all-knowing and comprehensive secret services, it will be sufficient.
Rules for nafting of ballons, bananas and circles
Server www.banknipautki.com, which reports annually an audit on the most absurd bank, has now decided to report the competition of "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU-land".
"We were led to the last event when the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the leading of large European fires," said the Right Organizator of the Patrick Nader Research.
For example, there is a recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the combination of rates for men and women.
Moreover, women at the prices of livelihoods have been advantaged because they are objectively less riskable for security.
"The further incredible ideas of the EU's district can be nominated by people until the end of the year.
The vote will then run by the end of February 2013," Nader informed.
The EU’s contravention Regulation also includes the obligation to mix biocombustibles into fuel materials, which results in damage to the nature, further prohibiting the use of related steel temperatures only because they contain relatively small quantities of dangerous substances, or the Directive on the size of blind clothes, which has expressly exploited the sheep in this year.
Criticals earlier also claimed the actual prohibition of the use of the expression of the sale oil or the classification of classic bulks from the sale.
Quality bananas have 14 metres
The Union shall often decide under the pressure of that or those commercial or industrial lobbys which the requests in Brussels are usually demanded by some State or group of States (so the Czech Republic is also subject to the threat of veta to its banks).
The interests of the lobbys were also because, for example, the highest quality of the bananas had to reach at least 14 cm long and were not to show "anonymal decrease".
On the other hand, the European Commission prevented it from harmonising only the relevant non-unified national standards that complied with trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and greenhouse have been decreased through the opposite of some States, indicating that existing Directives lead to food growth.
The candidate for victory in the investigation may also be the EU Londing Regulation, which requires to be obliged to warn that children are less than 8 years of age should not be disturbed without monitoring adults.
The EU has been addressed to America's research, according to which the balloons between players lead the death of children in destruction.
Similar restrictions are now applied to children up to 14 years when footing into the wilderness bottles.
Curious ideas are born at home
It is, then, relatively absurd to the rule on European officials alone - everyone who has an official in the EU cannot, in view of the sensitivity of the theme for Greece, use the name of Macedonia and have to speak about the FYROM (Former Yugoslavia of”.
Server Banko.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economy Laissez Faire, designated for an investigation other than some of those above, to absurd the Union Regulation on the volume of food resources in the Member State.
The EU has set the maximum amounts of food resources that could be located on the CRC territory on the day of our entrance into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the specified volumes of conserved bones, which threatened him with high repentance.
The investigation organisations also had the idea of paying to some countries because they had no sea, and the idea of giving contributions to the request of receipt of a grant.
However, these ideas did not appear in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're handicaped because we have no sea.
We request the European Union for refunds," the Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSSD) said at the subsection 2004.
As a argument, it stated that we had a lot of profits, and the result of interventional purchases should have been full of funds that he had to carry out.
For the sake of the Czech Republic, the EU had to pay hundreds of millions of euros according to Palace.
Finally, the European Commission came to the CRC by organizing a tender to purchase lands with no access to the sea.
The contributions to the receipt of funds were invited to the Common Ministry for Local Development, managed by the Minister of Germany (USD), particularly to go to the request for a submission from Brussels.
EU: Bizard Regulations are exceptional
Although the regulations in the Member States are easily critical, the EU's efforts to regulate and to improve the functioning and development of the whole Union deserve more recognition, according to a series of experts.
The more important problem, for example, is, according to experts, the advancement of EU contributions to projects that do not have any meaning of European integration, but which have been proposed by the Member States during budgetary negotiations.
Emotion between the Czech Republic also excites the fact that the CZR in Brussels must fight the right to specific indication of its traditional products, while it does not succeed in this stock.
Though after the sixteenth fight against Germany and Rakushana, the Olomouctic rocks were highlighted, but the foreign rum, whose tradition is in us until the 19th century, had to rename our producers to a foreigner.
The names of rooms can only be carried out from thirsty destillate, not from sugar river.
In the official list of EU registered products, the company of known feta and gorgonzole, a martipan from the German Lübecka or parmish sugars, such as carlovarian sugars, foolish and nearby capr and jactic chmel, have already been experienced in the official list.
The EU's protective signs can then also be a pardubian pearl and mountain troops.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm amateur, Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does the man attack that he wants to candidate to the president?
It doesn't matter to be a Senator or a president.
If it worked out in our country without problems, I'm going to miss anywhere.
But I can't see the last 20 years the country's disgrace, how evil is running, people's taxes and taxes are increased in the income.
I shouldn't have been a political ambition.
But when I see something that I don't like, I'm trying to come with a solution to change it.
And since I had forty years and I was an independent non-pageman, I have no other way to influence things than to candidate to the Senator or President.
You got to the Senate, but you broke the ships to the Hrad.
Don't you turn back to people who chose you?
I've been saying all the time I'm going to fight for the Hrad by the exhibition of the Senate elections.
After I said, if I'm chosen by a Senator, I'll be candidate to the president.
My goal, but it's not, it's a tool to achieve my vision.
That's why they have the biggest influence and the strongest mandate.
The problem is, however, not only that we give as a nation in the economy and in television, but that we are going to get everyone who wants to try to change.
It adds media that defeat humans and deceive the freedom of words with freeness of lies.
I might have been claimed to pay a journalist or to be the adviser of Jiri Paroubka.
Let's go to your vision.
In the fight against the Hrad, you went out with the weight of the political and criminal responsibility and the reverse ownership recognition over twenty million.
That's what you have to change the law.
As the president, but you have no such authority, and only Senate can exercise laws as a whole.
How do you want to solve that?
When I lobbyed as a citizen for the freedom of life, it was possible.
The problem is political - when someone comes with a good side left or right, he accepts that he will refuse and keeps the citizens.
As an independent indipendent, I have a far more potential to get support from all Parliament parties.
My priority is that without a page-scattering and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country, on every side, and apply it.
Do you think you're more than a man right or left?
From the Czech view, I think people's looking at me more to the left.
It doesn't matter to me, whether a little left or a little right.
It's important for me, and they went forward.
I don't know if someone belongs to the left or right, but I want people to connect.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it's on KSCHM or ODS, and I'm going to be against the wrong thoughts.
You're sorry when someone's saying you're a popular.
But you don't prove it by what you said?
If you create a business plan in the company, you also have a ideal goal and view.
And you're trying to draw close to that.
Someone can call it popularism, but all of us I'm talking about are already working in the world, or significant experts have spoken of them.
But without Parliament's support, only passwords will be left for you.
And you're not going to get out of the political time.
Or do you think if you are going to follow people and talk to them, you will be able to make a criminal and material responsibility for example?
I don't have any other option.
Concerning politics, journalists and publics and trying to get them on their own side, and they condemned it.
If I have been chosen by the President, it is not a problem to organize a direct television transfer where I ask the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legalize the material and criminal responsibilities for politics, officials, judges and state representatives.
And they should be informed about why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality that will call for a disaster, it can be pressed on a political scene.
Take the election of the president, that was the debt of public pressure.
I say I'm amateur, I'm not a genius or a intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to look for a association.
I just started in politics, and for my program I will try to obtain support.
I'm trying to move myself if it doesn't happen, I'll end in six years and return to the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura should save Czechland.
I'm not a saver.
I know that I'm not gonna do anything in one person, so I've kept a number of people known if they would also be in the Senate.
I went after Radim Janchura, he refused to work because of a lot of work.
So I at least supported the investigation of Jan Lorenc's journalist, who covered dusts with easily hot oil.
I candidated that people were really uncomfortable, but now I'm serious.
Seventy percent of people took the elections, and those who went have chosen the representatives of the establishment.
We're just two independent in the Senate.
People called the Senate so that changes would be harmful.
However, I will fight for my vision, for example for the direct choice of concerns or leaders.
Are you thinking about locking your own sides?
I'm not thinking about it yet because I don't have time to check the clean past of every potential side, and I don't have any money on it.
I don't have money for a presidential campaign. There's just 20 thousand on my transparency.
You don't have money?
You're talking about the owner's recognition, what's yours?
I'm estimating the private property for about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land of about 25 million, a apartment of ten million, another apartment of eight million, a collection of artistic works for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Superb Schodo for a million, and then I have a couple of million per age.
In addition to Aston Martin, I have because it was my boy dream -- I liked James Bond, who was in the car, was a galant to women, and at the same time fought against wrongdoing and distress.
You drive Aston Martin, you have a property for 60 million and you don't have money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to give your own money to that.
It's not too convinced.
I don't have 15 million for a campaign.
Is that what I need to debt?
I've been in the campaign for 2.5 million.
I don't have any sponsors, it testifies that my program is probably not interested.
And I don't have the obligation to pay a campaign from myself.
The expenses for the campaign are basically covering what I'm going to get the Senator Payment.
But I wouldn't survive from him, for example, I couldn't pay to the sons of English school that are 30 thousand per month.
If I just want to make money, I'm going to get anywhere.
So you're going to continue business so you can live?
Didn't you say you're gonna break these activities?
But that doesn't depend on the higher payment.
As I promised, I shared my activities.
For example, the travel operator will become my representative on the jail.
People want me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I also live from something.
How many of you were as a businessman, a common brother in the month?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, and I'm going to go.
And if I was the president, I'd finish my business.
The whole conversation will be found in the Sabbath issue of the Right.
MVRDV architects are the evidence that the guard association is not played only in the head - for example Spijkenisse and recently set Hora books - 2 photos
"This building seems to be happy, looks futurely. Finally, it's to see something interesting again," Lisette Verhaig says, which goes around the street.
Stefan Spermon, IT technology in the nearby big business, says, "Of course, this house is beautiful."
But I wonder why we still have the book today.
Everyone has the Internet, iPady and electronic books.
No one's going to any of these books in the old age now, right?
Spijkenisse, sitting close to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities that are not even for visit, holds a special record.
This region with 80 000 people shows the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid solution, a number of years ago, the general education contributed and set up seven beautiful screened iron miniatures of fictitive pounds shown on the euro banks.
Success of educational offices, but it wasn't any disappointment.
So the cities advisers knew that there is only the only possibility to become a gentlemen: we have to have a book!
Winy Maas from the Rotherdam Ietechtonic Atelier MVRDV, the master of a crazy courageous column graphs and a fascinating, often even cyclical buildings, took a thing with clothing calm and on competitive action in 2003, with five books under the foot and anxiety on the face.
And while the Commission still looked bitterly around herself and wrapped her arms, the white Maas broke his gifts on herself according to the size and his activistics ended the words "Free citizens!"
So this is mine on the top of the books in Spijkenisse, called Boekenberg!
In nine years later, the mountain was proposed for 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also belongs to the underground parking, supermarket, mail and a number of residential and serial houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In the beginning of November, the books of Hora were listed in the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated at the price of Du日 National Wood Award 2012.
The small-master sheep, which could not even offer more than the post-modern sandy area and an unusually harmful adviser for which the white fasad is more likely to expect milk, is more rich about a little co-detecture.
Moreover, but now Spijkenisse has the first public cultural building in his history.
Length Path to Book
The reader's eldorado under the stick on the sire.
By the middle of the mountain’s massage, though, the outputs, but the space and reading distress will be discovered until the topgraphy is slow.
From all sides the inside is light and transparent, the floor of fired cabry and elegant street lighters express the atmosphere of the public location.
The towns are perfect.
You see park lawyers, dogs, kids and girls playing.
And all the books, books, books, books.
"Normally the rules with the books are departed from the fasade and a big dark space, which is mostly unusual and unpersonal," Winy Maas says.
We have set up a classic space configuration up to the feet and the space for readers we've gone outside.
Inside the Hore books is very useful: in the middle of offices, online books, shack clubs, ecological centre and the centre of the household of technology.
Special comfort are black police on the books, which are once a wall wall, a parapet, and another appealing to steps.
The view, the structure and the ships are affected by strangers.
On the unknown building material, the heads of the heads are even swearing to the building engineers and the building engineers.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, leading project in the city of Spijkenisse, to question the Standard magazine.
So, in one Friday agricultural undertaking, one day, we reached a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, it is used as a base under the root of a milemeter round of synthetic weight in the steel and in the fields in the Netherlands.
It's mild and time-effects.
The thin textile will hold one, two seven, and then is grown to exit into a huge waste.
For the book, it was a rono - first in such a quantity - drawn on the tables of a four-meter floor.
By sharing the fire and pressure that is called Landbouwplastic (KLP) colors in dark, homogeneous and burdenful material, which flashes a little as a new car and a little like sporto_ bottles.
After 105 steps, you get to the top.
At the end of 500 meters of a long journey, you will be rewarded in literary coffee not only by a fantastic view of the city, but also by the Netherlands croquets and ficuss in blowers.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the right wall of air in the mountains.
Giving gifts to the new soul
"If you wouldn't believe that, but this house is despite a lot of glassed areas of show project on ecology," Trouborst says.
They're getting out and cold with the earth's heat.
Although the Mount of the Books stands under a glassed cloud, it lights the sun inside only shortly, even in the sundays.
Width wooden trains standing around to the open fasade serve as a shadow and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of them will be advised by the full automatic role.
Stefan Spermon, the original skeptic of the IT, has already visited the new book.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the manufacturer of the traditional Chinese medication Cynthia Bogarde, which Boekenberg even signs as "recently expected soul" Spijkenisse.
D日: Each inhabitant of the city was invited a few weeks ago to open one book from his personal fund.
In the first place, optical areas were not completely filled with a book, which currently reads 70,000 cuss.
The concept was testified.
The police are completely filled.
"There's nothing worse than a half empty book," says Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident has a certain relationship to the new house now.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if she'd just be for an exhibition.
This MVRDV has occurred in the king's discipline, which is called in the professional guard to create identity.
It's the psalmist who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is
Whatever young and unfair.
This is finally the standard point for identity.
"The Germans need to play more role"
Germany was stopped by voting at the decision of Palestine to adopt.
According to the expert of relations between the United States and the Europe of Stephen Szaboa, Berlin is balanced on a close term of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of a week signed that it would vote against us to the observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
Then, but Berlin stopped the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
However, Germany must now be careful for its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think it doesn't support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - but it would not be too critical against Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also continued to vote on the establishment of an aircraft area.
Finally, it was the NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take care of serious international topics?
Yeah, that's it.
D'em is that it just changes its business policy, and this is the direction from the policy that was so-called by the United States, towards the German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult that Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They're expected to play independenter roles, but they're not usual.
I think they're just in their role, but they're on the way to the "normal" policy.
To the foreign policy, which is owned in France or Great Britain.
What specifically does the "normal" policy of the German view mean?
It shows the preparation to work in the case of national interests and positions independent of the positions of the United States or of European partners.
I think the German business policy is motivated by economic policies, such as exports and its relations with certain aspects, whether Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are in certain ways other than the economic interests of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have economic interests affected the position in the nearby conflict and voting in the United Nations?
First, Germany has a large residence on the Middle East, especially in the countries around the Persian Valley.
Therefore, it must be cautious not to fear the public, but not to elite in Arab countries.
Everyone plays a role.
I wouldn't even like to ascribe too big importance to it, it's not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, it plays a significant role in German views.
Did German relations with the United States damage when, in the case of both important decisions, Germany remained voting, for example by voting on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think it was such a dramatic crash as in Libya.
I hope Germany even gets a certain respect.
It also signals that it must be considered international player and his interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different views of Palestinian initiative.
The U.S.A. forgiveness was expressed for veto.
Is there opinion differences between the United States and many European nations?
These divisions existed as a result of the American Internal Policy.
I think the Government of Obam has probably a significant understanding for the European position.
But in the result of more political ability, of course, this position cannot stand publicly.
I think divergences in views are not as large as they seem.
When you look at the relations between Obama and the Ministerial President Netanjahu, Obama does not have too much overwhelmed by Netanjahu's policy.
Is it not difficult for Germany to introduce close relationships with Israel and the United States on one side and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other hand?
I think that's exactly what the Germans do.
For Germany, of course, it would be a little easier if there was a coherent and unique European policy, which is not at present.
Therefore, they cannot be part of the broader lines and have to move things forward from their own position.
That's what they're just doing with yours.
I believe Germany will take the leading role in the future and press Europe to the European position.
This is, of course, not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
It was a emotional topic.
But I think Germans have to play an independent role.
See Germany himself in the role of a significant international player? Do you want to overcome the main role at all?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not usual, it is still inappropriate, and the country is still more difficult to play.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, then, when Germany accepts a more role, the anti-German attacks will occur.
That doesn't help Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be circumcised by enemy countries.
In this regard, Germany is in much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for different neighbors and views, and it is not easy.
The impact of the U.S. on European Policy is now still decreasing, but the EU does not comply with this vaccine currently. Who else remains here?
The Germans will just have to play a more role.
Even if they don't like it, it's inappropriate to them, and it'll make them much more unfair -- c'est la life!

"Reserve Mark" in China: when Puma and Armania are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a worldwide label, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
What's Armania Polo?
In addition, the labelling which is completely registered in China is hidden, but it does not have anything to do with the p's company.
However, it uses protection until the owners of the labels are blaming them.
And not even then, if the rights are home.
"For foreigners is still more difficult to protect their marks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in Taylor Wessing office, which is specialised to violate protection rights on the East.
Every week there's a new case on my board.
Patterns have enough letters to log in their tags.
From the Gu marks, for example, Lu-Gu and instead of Prada, they are allowed to register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies are also legally copied, perhaps the producer of the sports goods of Puma.
Pattloch opens the assistant with the records of the signature office in Peking.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company left there to protect the trade label Zegna DF Puma. A artificial name that also parasits in the modern house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that China's misters of the world are in copying and injury of mental property.
In the big cities there are several trading houses, where there are extraordinary sales of landscapes.
However, the cases of Pattloch are otherwise. It is contrary to the fact that the Chinese firms have the full right to use the labels already protected somewhere else.
Chinese it is called "Bang Mingpai", accompanied tag.
This word is intended to "Bang Dakuan".
These are mines of women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not guilty of any fault.
"It hurts the business, we have to shoot it," Pattloch calls.
"It's going to be divorced, the exceptional position disappears, the damage of the image is bitter."
Financial losses and legal costs achieved are to millions, especially in dear showing products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China is a 15 billion euro per year to the third largest market for goods and markets that grow not more.
However, the viability of doubt records in the register can be achieved hardly, and it is worth something.
The management can be extended to nine years, with an incredible outcome.
Pattloch reports the cases when the court rejected the complaint, because the name is made after a long time of the duration of the "reality of" long.
When the complainting party has a labour, he must pay the plagiator yet because he has hurt his mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's a jungle law.
The famous cases are also related to graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of building machines Sana, a company who recently took the German Cherpadel manufacturer to the Beton Mix Putzmeister.
Therefore, Chinans are still able to use an emblem like the Mercedes star.
The Geely company, who bought Volvo, used a blue logo that was at BMW. Spor was equipped, Geely had to change the logo.
Lacoste was lost in China with the farmers from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned a famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not guilty of any fault.
Although the CTMO Agency admits that there was too small number of employees and spaces in 2010.
But in the remote year, it is evident that "the progress of the work process returned from the nutrition to the normal."
For example, the number of non-processed meetings decreased by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, it is still waiting for 81 500 stages in the office.
Something against this is dear.
As it is often in China, it's impressive numbers.
The CTMO was granted more than 1.4 million in the remote year for the protection of the label, which is a third of more than 2010.
It's a record, and it means that China's a list of new registrations worldwide.
This also applies to all valid protective labels -- it's a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011 1,8 billion Juan were elected for payments.
This simply means that each registration is 1280 jwans or 160 euros.
Initial contrast with this, there is a polycanase, as shows the case of a German family company joynberg.
This concert has been fighting against the Chinese plagiator for more than seven years.
However, Germans have reached that his illegal production of imitated car parts was canceled.
Yet, the pandeal has strengthened the Chinese rights to the joynberg mark continued.
They themselves reminded that because the receipt in Germany cannot be protected, says Hanna Wentzler, president of the company joynberg Chemical Specialities in Mnich.
The CTMO Office also refused to meet the Mnich company.
In two other instances, although the joynberg has the rights, but the opposite in the dispute is still fighting.
You need to take a terrible attention.
The matter is now negotiated by the Supreme Court.
Wentzler's confidence that things will lead to a good end and praise the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The management is extremely costful and we are deserving a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could not be calculated. In the company they had to see hundred years of old writings to present evidence.
Five years ago, the company gladnberg offered a "height sixth amount in yours" for a comparison of the dispute.
"You see what that means for us," Wentzler says.
It is threatened that the dangers from the Mount East will include Europe too.
And it's in the case that the imitators will make the unsaved marks there.
For example, one Chinese manufacturer wanted to register a joynberg marking in Germany for clothes and skin.
This business activity has been denied a long time, yet it has been able to reject the registration.
"There must be a terrible attention," Wentzler says.
He and Pattloch lawyer advises German businesses to be very careful in trade with China.
It does not suffice for international marking rights, but foreigners should have "whatever they are worth for protecting, to register also in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise it may be much less than registration.
In fact, if the company enjoynberg in the last property of its drama is in line with the mark, then it will probably have to pay license payments for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be pressed from the market in the contrary segment.
World Day of War against AIDS: Dupning, singing, help
In Heidelberg, the assembly of Imbongi - and in Switzerland, the poor people who died for AIDS are happy.
The history of the connection that overcomes a lot of more than 8733 km.
First, there is a dupning: Cowboy high boats, basketball boats, ladies boats and pan mocasines are looking for a takt park and ≥ too.
One-two-three-four.
Then they will slowly take up the voices of the songs - al, bas, tenor, and sorrow - they swim, moms, and each other.
The 29-year-old leader Fiete Hopfa is too higher than his textile boots when he connects his voices with his very wild gests.
It's Monday evening. In the musical song of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the congregation of Imbongi will test a new song.
It came to fifty songs and songs between 23 and 69 years, from a researcher of human genetics to a household.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple track, each congregation vote has another text and more in a very strange language - a zolu that speaks 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesoth, Malawi, Mozambique and Switzerland.
Help for self-help
Unids, the United Nations AIDS - Agency, considers that about 34 million people are infected by HIV virus worldwide.
From that, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Switzerland there are 245 000 poor people after parents who died for AIDS.
HIV position is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 poor people who died in AIDS, he found a group of Voices for Africa in Germany.
70 of them visit the second degree school.
In 15 or 20 euros per month, the pattern can be taken.
It guarantees children school, school uniform and one warm food daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means in the language of Zulu "History Manufacturer" or also "the one who is a master".
No one can speak in this room with a gas-bathus, just sing.
For ten years, the congregation has trained a song in this foreign mixed speech and sometimes brings them back from where they are buried: south Africa.
At the air distance of 8 733 km from Heidelberg, the north - east of the Switzerland town of Estoni, which depends on the power of the votes of the German congregation.
Forty percent has been affected
It lives there about 2000 people, some still in a simple or smoke-breaker woods, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore, because they followed you HIV virus.
In Estoni, it is to be seen in a small board of the whole Switzerland: the highest level of HIV influenza, the lowest expected life length worldwide according to UNICEF.
The circonscription of the man's pre-summer, which demonstrately reduces the risk of half-powers, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Switzerland have a weak immunity virus in themselves. There is no frequency that they die in 30 years.
This village opened the congregation at the common journey to Africa in 2005. However, the members of Imbongi saw many children in the streets, not only family care, but also cleansing everything: food, clothing, education.
Without finished school education, they have no chance in the poor country.
In the beginning, it was a private setting of individuals that per year allowed a child to send to school for a few euros and to give him one hot food daily.
However, a year later, the assembly of "Voices for Africa" has been established as well as professionally from that time for poor people who died on AIDS.
Sexually transmissible infections
What are the most serious sexually transmissible diseases?
Bacteria SPI belongs to syphilis, chlamydia and canca (gonorea).
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papilomavir, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Mountains and scrabs belong to parasite SPI.
Who belongs to the most affected group?
Syfilis and the pocket are mostly present in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch's constitution comes from that at least four of the five cases of syphilide reported in Germany are transferred by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, there are sexually transmissible diseases that are often produced, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidosis (plashing), cancer and human papilomavirs.
HIV is relatively small among the heterosexual adults in us, but approximately 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV appear to this group.
Chlamydia infections among youths are significantly more frequent than in other population groups.
According to European investigations, three quarters of all infections are related to young people from 15 to 25 years.
Moreover, among youths, human papilomavirs are often produced.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmissible diseases must be reported.
The beginning of the syphilide, according to the Robert Koch Constitution, was more than 3698 diseases in 2011 from 1697.
The beginning of new HIV infected people has been decreased since 2007.
In 2011 there were approximately 2700 cases.
It's about one ten less than a year ago.
What symptoms are warning about disease sex?
Infectional diseases may cause injury in ≥ genitality, distress in motion, exhaust, pain in the powder and powder or brada.
However, they often do not affect any pain or other symptoms, and they will not be observed.
How can you protect yourself?
The risk of injury can reduce the condom, but they do not offer a gradual protection.
Because sexually transmissible diseases may also be partially transmitted infections from uncleanness and heavy physical contact.
Therefore, the experts recommend regular investigation, in particular in case of frequent sex partners.
In the case of a periodic weather, you can treat the SPI frequency and prevent the adverse effects.
Thanks to the pattern, good gifts, and in a series of honoraries that the congregation makes singing throughout Germany, the money is stored.
"We have already sent approximately 200 000 euros to Estini," the President's college Annette Lennartz said.
Finance from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious woman that can be seized.
He also cares for the atmosphere of the kids, for example in some of the grandparents.
Gogo, as it is said to old women in the language, are the villages of the villages.
Some of them also took 14 poor people, gave them a shot over their head, and they wanted children to get each day in uniforms to school.
Children who have no one are going to the Khanyisile attorney, a single woman who is paying together as two kitchens that cook for more than 200 hungry children daily.
Moreover, "Voices for Africa" founded a chicken school, set two curves, and together with the American Health Organization of PSI, many people in the village were allowed to make HIV tests.
It's not clear, even if the illness of the whole country is so obvious, everyone's silent about it.
King of 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely tabu," says Annette Lennartz, "for it's about sexuality."
In fact, a lot of wonderful in the land where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
The final absolutist monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III., is known as his immortal life.
Polygamies instead of democracy.
In addition, the authorised way of life by this country is also due to the wine that HIV virus has been extended in the past decades.
But too many migrating workers who broke the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says that the condoms are free on each corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different -- unsaved."
To at least a little support for cultural exchange, the assembly of Imbongi travels once in two, three years together in southern Africa and sing a song full of harm, fighting, confidence in the future and the self-consciousness of the black, many in the southern area of the black continent still knows from the time of the apartheid.
The bus is full of white people who sing in the word of black - such a assessment brings not only comfort and joy, but has already laughed in many wild poetry soldiers.
The road also leads to Esitania, where the songs visit children on which they have a pattern.
Although this village is coming, you can find on maps, in the valley of the Eyeweni river is more than known.
"Go to Esitanti, there's a light," people say there.
And when you come back to Heidelberg, which is a 8733 miles from here, to the dumping songs in the temptation at the Bergheimer Street, you see that this light lights here.
Messenger: NASA discovered on Mercuro ice
Sonda Messenger found evidence that there is ice on the Mercur planet.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The American National Aviation and Cosmon Agency (NASA) showed the existence of ice on the Mercur planet.
Although the nearest sun is, there is also a frozen water, as it comes from three studies that published the professional magazine "Science" on Thursday.
The Sonda Messenger found evidence that there is a ice cover in this planet that lies in the permanent shadow.
This is expected to be at least 30 meters and maybe even 20 meters strong.
This water comes from comet or maybe of asteroids that arrived to Mercuro.
But let's not find ice related to the existence of life on this planet, he said the leaders of the workers on the song of Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The Mercury temperature can reach up to 426 degrees Celsia.
However, findings can help us to explain how water and other fundamental elements of life are reached into other solar systems.

The photos of the spirit galaxies have continued to be colored by artificial parts.
The collection that the European South observer has published shows a number of thousands of light years remotely from Trifid in the Star of Shoot.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (separated by three parts, triclone), because the dark powder divides the burning heart of this star generation into three parts.

Our views to the universe: the most important telescopes
The distance was found in 1608, Hans Lipperhey. Before Galilee Galilee, he used it for a year after to observe the stars.
Since that time, the views of optical remote views have continued to be increased - and the views that are from the deep are still deeper.
The biggest remote view in the world was for 30 years, which was from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at Palomar observators near San Diega.
The look on this image had a average of five meters.
In the American Ar ́na is Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into the universe immediately using two mirrors, each of which has an average of 8.4 metres.
Inside Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is great. Only the look is measured at average 10,4 meters.
Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmentated to reduce costs.
However, his prospect reaches about 11 meters.
The outcome of the leaving way: the telescope is assessed by a hacker in the high corner, which is its movement.
The telescope of Hobby-Eberly is also fixed in the high angle in Texas.
His speciality is a high strengthening of light flow.
Despite the relatively small prospect of the mirror, it is equivalent to the largest stars of the world.
A radiotelescope in Arecibu (Portorico) is guarding people in the universe after alien signals.
This radio telescope has an average of 305 meters.

There's Very Large Telescope, and he honors his name.
This remote view with a total of four stars can also light the middle infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large distance view is also planned for the Chile observers of the ESO.
His main mirror must be filled with 42 metres and must be loaded from 1000 star elements.
Photos can be calculated first in 2018.
Two Keck's remote views on the Hawai Sop Mauna Kea were considered to be the biggest world in 2007.

Keck's remote views are parts of Mauna Kea observators, which, besides them, watch the universe and help Subaru and IRT's telescope.
Moreover, Mauna Kea has to appear a new telescope, with a 30-meter district of the star.
Here you can surprise it on the picture.
However, the most important ideas from the universe are shown by Hubble's spatial remote view.
The remote world collections have been given to us since 24 April 1990.
The Kosmical Telescope Kepler split from March 2009 after extrasolar planets - especially after those who are residents.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that from the beginning of the mission, 1235 candidate planets were found.
The image has been documented the last preparation before launching the Kepler Universal Telescope.
The worldwide remote view James Webba (JWST) will be shot first in 2018 to the universe on the crack of Ariane 5.
The primary mirror of the universe infrared telescope is average of 6,5 meters.
One of the telescope tasks is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxy after the Great Tree.
Scientists get out of the ice is even in the southern field of Mercur.
However, there are no reliable data for this, because the Messenger circulates around this planet far closer to the north field.
Radar measurement has shown that it is on Mercuru ice for a few decades.
Thanks to the song of the Messenger, sent in 2004, and it is the first to be around Mercur, the people now have security.

I'm going to fire the Talish, we can call a romantic winter.
Microbus running on the street with many trailers has sealed whitely frozen coppers, nice rivers and simple village buildings.
Everything is green and fashioned, almost seems to be in Schwarzwald.
However, this is the greatest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here is a Kawakhish ethnic group of Thailand, of which it is not too known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijan and enjoy a very high.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is honoured too monumental from the Soviet times, which is sometimes in the small mountain regions.
The tourists from Europe are not coming here; the arrival from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku is too uncomfortable.
It takes eight hours at 323 km, because the road is only one-speed.
The riches of poverty for which lands often thank in the Caspian Sea have not yet been here forward.
However, Pilata Fatulajeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attack.
"Baku celebrated the Great Price of Eurovise in May - and we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world next year," says Fatulajeva.
He's a director of the Museum of Eternity, like the only one in the world.
Here is a documented life at least eight Tutches of Talish from the surroundings that are hundred years older. Fatulajeva shows black white photos.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
He was born a child in Venezuela in 136 years.
However, the distressing star of this museum is a shepherd of the sheep Shirali Müslumov, who was evidently 168 years old.
It does not exist.
And because the oldest person with documents was 122 years old, Müslemov's ́k seems to be generally suspicious.
"He was born in 1805 and in 1973 died," explains Fatulajev.
This man was probably three times married and had 23 children.
Did Sherali Muslim not fail in his cup for a few decades?
However, he also heard about the flying people in Central Asia, the Gerontolog of the Maxe Planck Constitution in Rostock.
"It is most likely that many people live in some China, Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan," says Scholz, "and in Sardinia lives extremely many old men."
However, because of missing foundations, no evidence of the depth cannot be given, especially when the matrix is missing.
Each day of the diluted oil glass
But it is that people around Lerike get a Bible book often.
There are now 20 people who are 100 years old.
Why, then, lives there in the south of so many flying people?
The Azerbaijan Prince Farid Mugimzadeh explains this to the special genes of the Talis.
The director of Fatulje's Museum, however, doesn't mean that it's in life.
However, the caloric food of the Talis who love meat, bread, and mainly milk products, and of which many drink the glass of solved oil daily, is so healthy, it does not seem to be rightly worthwhile from bromatological view.
Or is this the p's way of life that holds young people? in Cengemira, a small place near the city of Lerik, Rubab Mirzajev lives.
In 97 years, this geographical width is still relatively young.
Mirzajev, who claims that he has 143 fruits, lives in a simple tree house that is typical for the entire Kawakean region.
He's sitting on the ground with the mass that he's able to swallow.
There are eight men living under one street, other than one of the sons of Mirzajev and the daughters, both of them are a long time old parents.
Two little kids are running around.
In the kitchen, the tea is prepared for guests, which is given in typical "armade" glasses.
The white teeth of Mirzajev forms a perfect range and hides a long dark blonde copy, which proudly discovers her son before us.
I'm always kidding my hair with milk, so they didn't look like me and keep their color.
"I never used a champion," says Mirzajev.
The monthly income to life is enough
She eat only what buried out of her own court, race, brambores, games.
For my whole life, I've never pulled food once in the supermarket.
Then he'll tell me about his man who was in the army.
It was the worst for the Second World War.
But everything improved when he took the bathroom "loved father" Geydar Alijev.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the culture that is made around the position of the father of the nations, who ruled his land as a dictator, in Azerbaijan does not know the limits.
He was at power until 2003, then took his son Ilham's bag.
The elderly people in Azerbaijan at least don't suffer distress.
Mirzajeva gets 230 manates (approximately the same amount in euros) each month. This is at the current proportions of the range from which it can be well survived.
And maybe the older Mirzai's son is true: "Age people burn in our culture great seriousness."
They live with big families, they are loved, stumbled and happy.
It's not gonna stay alive as long as
The concept of human rights is missing
The revolution returned to Cahira.
The depth demonstrations in Cairo depicted the depth of the land.
The island is discussed on the future position based on the right of the sherry.
The Egyptian president wasn't investigated by a patase.
We have to create a transition.
"And because we do this, I am responsible, before people and before God," he said in the state TV.
His word was appointed to the whole nation, especially to the Christian Cops, to the liberals, to the Muslims and to the secondary persons.
All of you, even in an unnatural statement in an opposition, they're afraid.
Further fear of the "God State" on the Nile for grace to the powerful Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursí was so excused that he had a transitional limitation of the competence of the Constitutional Court and extended his own to "teach the revolution".
However, what a 61-year engineer who has the title of the doctor of the American University in South California really wants to save, there are no Egyptians nor the world.
Should the justice be released?
234 paragraphs, which the main Constitutional Constitutional Meeting of Islamists to overwhelming have approved in 15 hours of night marathon, are partly provoking anxiety.
Like in the former institutions, it is also said that the jurisdiction is based on "the principles of the Islamic Rights".
But what does it mean "the rules"?
It was, and it was an explanation and it could be afraid that the Islamics would use this unexpected formula and the legal free space associated with it for a closer explanation of blue.
At least this lights the new added paragraph: In all cases relating to sharing, it is necessary to consult the University of Al-Azhar, which is the most important islamic institutions in the country with a great impact on the whole Sunnith Islam.
It doesn't have to, but it may mean that Clerus will monitor legislation, which would bring justice to real derogation of its rights.
There are many explanations in the constitution
The problem is also that civil rights of military courts must continue to be maintained.
These courts served for the Government of Mubar to deal with opposition.
After the fall of dictature, there were up to 11 000 civilians in the military union.
As it states, it should also be able to protect "the right of Egypt's family and support its moral and values".
This is so inaccurately formulated on the legal side that the State institutions could even control the contents of the movie art and of the movie.
In a comprehensive speech, it doesn't mean anything else than the censure.
Lastly, no paragraph is written to men and women’s explicit equality.
Thus, another paragraph prohibits the prophet Mohammed or his sentences.
However, it remains ashamed of shame and how it will be achieved.
It also makes doubt that the formula is prohibited by the "promotion of people".
In this case, is it enough for the president's carrier or to make the rights known?
More explanation, as many other in this instruction, which Mursí will submit to the signature and, according to his words, "very soon" will present the Egyptians for a people's vote.
"Revolution returned"
For a few weeks, opposition has been formed against the cross of islamists.
Tens of people were conceived in unusual weight on Friday evening at Tahrir in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional sheet before he began to pay.
"Revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who was located in the presidential elections on the third place.
Nobel's price and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej declared that our constitutions belong to "in the waste."
Through the middle of the short news service, Twitter accused Mursí's prosecution that they wanted to take a gun against democracy.
"When the referendum is announced, we'll go to his palace and take it," said the opposite officer Jasir Said.
"We haven't been disappointed, the blood of our brothers hasn't been sorrowed yet," the Egyptian media of the opposition policy of Chalida Alí.
A number of judges noticed that they did not want to monitor the references that would be wrong.
"The Coran is our statute"
The well-organized Muslim brotherhood has announced an exhibition demonstration, but not with caution at Tahrir, but after a cruel prayer at the second side of Nile before the Cairo University.
Many clothed women and salafists who cried: "The people require the application of God's law."
They called Mursy, "Clean the earth!" and they assured, "The Quran is our mouth."
The battle for the surrounding of the symbolic position of Tahrir, which would probably lead to a similar civil war.
The Mursy's dressers were obviously not trying to risk.
The Muslim brotherhood announced that the opposers and the staff were prompted by a voice and clearly exhausted.
Now it's time to leave people at the electoral hours to decide where the country is to go.
It is certain that the benefits of islamists are considered.
"The word 'Mens' doesn't appear once."
The exhausted constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all community forces, is the Hafize Abú Sa'd.
The eighty-five-year human rights duty and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EEHR) dealed with the members of the Muslim Brothership when they were for Mubarak or standing before the court.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are unpartial.
He was killed, condemned and captured.
"And in the new statement now there are no words 'human rights' once," it's in a conversation for "Welt am Sonntag".
The enlargement of the power of Mursy to all three powers in the State has granted this lawyer to reject.
These measures are a scandal prosecution against democratic rules of game and they will tell Egypt to the new dictator.
"Instead of the president to strengthen the civil society, he actually rejected it," Sa'd'd demands.
However, without a civil society organisation, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community that follows the stock of ideological groups on the Nile with the mixed science and pressure.
That could be a mistake to him.
The demonstrator at Tahrir warns: "You created a monster that you can't control anymore."
Norwegian cancer: The most exciting fish in the world?
Five million people in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the country's success secret be linked to the local appointment for extra-speaking fish?
Take a couple of overviews.
Place them inside the hormone of the spine and mocrobal tools.
Let it lie a week.
So you get those who are paralyzing cancer snaps, one of the largest Norwegian delicates.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Osla.
There's a snow here, a beautiful look -- and in the air, there's everywhere present snow.
Rakfisk is a swimming powder in the water for a period of a year - depends on how much you want to be fished.
As it starts to be cold and cold, Norway here in Fagernes begins to get to the festival dedicated to the best, the most underlying meal to say it.
"You dream it, sirs, and then you drink it with a glass aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional charter, but also called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
People all around us eat small fish coats and drink them with a large quantity of alcohol.
"Some people have ra'i aquavit than cancer," he says Havard.
The drinks can swallow the bullets.
I'll try a few bits.
Fisheries can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's a similar sushi cut that was on the long way of the bus.
Rakfisk is a product very different when poverty was in Norway, and because there were no irons yet, fish on the grounds were put into water and salt aircrafts.
Then the winters, when they were well devastated, extracted and eat -- the senses of no doubt disturbed alcohol.
Only one generation before, thousands of Norrows were forced to leave their country and search for work, while most of them emigrated to the United States.
Currently the population grows - more than 13% of immigrants are an attachment to a large amount of work, high expenditure and a comprehensive care system.
The people of Sweden, an old rival, who had been very richer than Norway recently, run to the country for work.
The cancer is viewed as something important, insultable, even though the relatively affecting part of the Norwegian past.
It belongs to the dearest food on the market.
Although the dear is all - small beer glasses or sandwich will get you out to 9 pounds (14 pounds) per kitchen.
Norway is often not in the worldwide reports - and it seems that most people say that.
The name is Anders Breivika, the right racist extremist, who shot 77 men, women and children last year, here people are still talking about disaster.
Instead, the shot is called "a event of July 22".
Norways can only be hard to believe that one of them in their peaceful country was capable of such brutality and murder.
According to the current riches of Norway, a growth of one of the world’s biggest industrial and gas developments from the beginning of the 70th century.
"But the rock is not the only thing why we do so well," he says by giving a taliers with a fair cancer of our cheese, which with its long hair blondes and surprisingly blue eyes represents the prototype of northern blackness.
We're like you're saying, people's mindful.
Her English, as the English of the people from now, is completely unusual.
We're not taking ahead, we don't have any evidence.
Norway is very careful with its poor riches - other than a small percentage of money from this sector is invested in a special fund designed for future generation.
When all the rest of the years leading to the world’s financial degree was spent money that they had not, the Norways had a firmly insult on their heads.
"When we can lie in the winter and walk in the summer, we are happy," he says.
"And eat cancer," adds a laughless smile.
I'm standing in the snow in the front for something to eat - I've got enough cancer.
Such a burger is certainly something else, and he's nicely stumbled.
But tonight, the fish's stumbled again.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places where cancer is given to dinner and where the guests choose the best, or more for whose most-fair fish.
They are connected to a living television transportation, where the modernizer is a round-screen tallar with cancer.
It's like an Eurovisual competition.
"What scores do you have for the best fish in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"This is our pointing, Havard."
It's called a laughing and laughing.
He's falling out of the board, maybe a man capable of aquavit.
Or maybe all of those fish.
Enrique Pena Neto from Mexico has a hard start
As the mexican president Enrique Pena Neto prepares for the overtake of the Office, Will Grant from BBC looks at the challenges that he faces, and to the mixed expectations of his companions.
Transport to Mexico City is currently bad.
In towns that are stumbled even in the best times, the oceans were closed with a number of key travels to the main city and caused by the streets of chaos.
However, the aim was not to prevent the efforts to get to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing the Parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico Enrique Pena Neto will receive the presidential sherp and take the lead of the people.
He's headed to a special job.
Mexican, however, was very economic in the time of the Office of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the burning of drug war, which has already taken 60,000 lives for six years.
"My government has a big commitment to the Mexican people in destruction of violence," President Pena Neto said to the American President Barac Obam in the Ovail work at the beginning of this week.
For a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he got his hand with the American president, President Pena Neta received political experience as a ́mexican's householder.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old household, a national and a distant country around the main city.
Right man.
For example, in the foreign city Valle del Bravo, they are in a good way.
Citizens attribute to the development of tourism in the airport and the building of infrastructure.
Now you can reach one of the new remotes that Pena Neto has allowed to build. These towns are a huge improvement than the deep and hot roads that were here before.
The tables with his name are also on the wall of the modern sport centre and the imponent interactive museum with the climate changes.
"We expect to bring a permanent and permanent change," says the friend and political partner Gabriel Olver Hernandez, the Statelor of President Pena Neta, the Partie of the institutionized revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope in interesting and emotional changes in security and economies that our countries so need.
After 81 years of uninterrupted power, the Pri side was extracted by Vicent Fox.
Deputy Olver admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace Los Pinos, many are expected inside of Enriqua Pena Neta.
And he refuses to express opposition characterising the new president as a man without a substantial dimension.
He's a very direct person, very excited with a wonderful vision of the country.
He's a great statement, and he's primarily a man who can listen.
But on the other hand of the state, this is not the idea that many people have from their ex-worker.
In Nezaalcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, it cannot be more evident that the contrast with the defected streets Valle del Bravo.
Insulted under remote findings in many places in the subject of Mexico's own main city.
And the problems in the own foreign are also sustainable and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the military was invited to help the control of drug gangs operating in fourths, particularly the violation of women.
Only in the past two years, there were an empty places near the bitter waste of the body of the tuckets of murdered women.
In the time Pena Neto ́er, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico, which is much more than in a notoric violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is a synonym for murdering innocent women.
In the best case, Pena Neta critics say that when he acted in the office, he failed to deal with adequately with the problem of the murder of women.
And in the worst case, his leader's accusation of closing the eyes.
In the beton house, typical for the square, Irinea Buendia shows me the photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and weeps a weeping.
According to the official version, Marian succeeded suicide in 2010.
Yet, her family does not kill her partner.
"When I arrived in her house, it looked like her body was like someone kissed," Mrs. Buendia said.
There were signs on him after the winds, and it's already started a post-dead injury.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the image on the wall, right next to the cross on which the only word is "righteousness".
Yet, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were born.
The State authorities were taking me as if I was an old boat, a pressure, and a library.
They want you to accept what they say and quietly.
"But it can't be right when so many mistakes and reminds me," he says.
The sherp that President Pen Neto will receive on Saturday is granted a great responsibility.
In the past six years, 100,000 families in Mexico have been committed by violent crime, and the new president has promised that after his action in the office, they will be his priority.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was," he says in Valle del Bravo lawyer PRI Olver.
However, that is exactly what the family of victims in Ciudad Nez is most afraid.
Bradley Manning wasn't trying to get bad, he's a military prosecutor.
The military prosecutor is trying to repeat Bradley Manning's statement about the gross intention.
The hearing is focused on Manning's residence in the military camp in Quantico city in Virginia.
The committee wants the case to be refused on the basis of a gross consequence with Manning in the procedure.
The war is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to demonstrate that the soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest extent of secret material in the history of the United States, has mixed a lot of opportunities to get to the gross consequences that he seemed to have suffered in the military connection.
The military prosecutor May. Ashden Fein at the cross-spreaching of the Manning military at the preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland claimed that the weekly visits records that Manning had with the agencies during nine months of the conviction in Quanticu in Virginia showed no complaints on the wrong conviction.
The cross claims that occurred during the hearing carried out on us would refuse the case leading against Manning from a brutal detention during the time of a commitment, which is the same to be sufficient for himself, passed on the day after Manning witnessed that he was thinking of suicide.
Analysis of military science arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents in their service in Iraq.
The material was then published online at WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
On the Friday hearing, the military prosecutor Fein and Manning passed the formulaes that the experts fulfilled after meeting with Manning in the Vasing Center in Quantica, where he was held in the regime with increased care from July 2010 to April 2011.
Maning's experts asked questions and mentioned his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday on these formulaes, Manning admitted that the detention from his guards had been valued as "exciting" and the total detention in the equipment was valued as "very professional".
The formularies do not show any complaints on bad consequences, even though Manning's adults directly asked how he was engaged with him, Fein said.
Maning replied that the fears of various problems were exposed to his mouth and that the experts who visited him talked to him about these concerns and indicated that they would be concerned, however, did not record these problems.
"They asked "no problems" (after the concerns were discussed), and that didn't necessarily mean that I hadn't changed about them," said Manning.
Justice Mr. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he didn't take care of his person in January 2011 in meeting with the Commission on self-mortal thoughts that he had expressed in the formula about a few months ago.
Manning replied that during this meeting, it was his intention to achieve the decrease of the "prevention of damage".
The Army noted that this restrictive regime (one degree under self-mord surveillance regime) used for its protection and security of the residents.
"I wanted the overseers to tell me that I'm okay and I wanted to cancel this regime of prevention of hurt... so that I could enjoy a higher quality of life as I saw this," said Manning.
Manning witnessed on Thursday his arrest in Iraq and transport to Kuwait, where he was held at the same time two months before he was transported to the Vassing County on the basic sea pigs in Quanticu in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was thinking of suicide in Kuwait, and once he was throwing warm down there.
He noticed that he was not allowed to ignore what he would be with him and what was happening in the surrounding world was very touching.
"My world blowned only on the base of Arifdjan, on this key," said Maning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cut.
Manning noted that after the arrival to Quantica he spent a day (minimum 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small target without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one matrace, covering, rubbers, such clothes and brilliants.
He said he was trying to walk because sleep or only beds were in a day against rules.
Manning pointed out that he slept with a light from the outer side of the cell in the eyes.
He noticed that if the guardians couldn't see his face when he turned on the other side, they wake him up and had to turn back.
Maning's legal representative presented formal complaints for the deal with Manning's soldier in January 2011.
Manning was transferred in April 2011 to the military office in Fort Leaven′th in Kansas.
On Wednesday, Judge Manning also asked for a complaint that he raised in the quarter statement regarding the fact that after he had been charged to sleep one night at its end in Quanticu, he was also required to stand quickly before the guard and the final companions at the early calculation.
Manning told him he wasn't allowed to cover his covering.
On Friday's hearing, Judge Manning stated that from the order of his guards, he used his covering to cut off, but admitted that no one had given him the order to delay it.
On Wednesday, Manning told him that he had been forced to sleep at night because he tried to show the expert that he wasn't dangerous.
Manning pointed out that he told the officer that he could use a pocket from his bottom cow or his instructions to hurt him, but he didn't do it.
Manning told that this night was removed from his circle, his phones and brilliants.
His legal representative hopes that the judge will take his experience through his authorisation and that, in the case of his certificate before the military court, whose beginning is expected at the beginning of the next year, his penalty is significantly reduced.
The approved stated that it planned that Manning would recognize the wine in less criminal acts and that he would fight the final accusation because they were too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is planned for this week, expected by the military prosecutor to deal with the wallets as authorised.
The Pentagon stated that Manning was maintained in accordance with the rules concerning all arrested with maximum care.
The accusation imposed against Manning includes the assistance of enemies, the legal cause of the publication of reporting documents on the Internet, the transfer of information on national security and the claim of public property or registration.
Where he is accused at all points, he may be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American identities
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico from the insufficient options that are there.
The mexicans have the ability to guilt those who have gone; they take hard time to them, says.
Navarrette says that the Americans are lapened between the two worlds.
On the last journey to the main town of Mexico, I just went through the daisy and came to the space for the immigrants' agenda, where I reached a problem.
The pipes were indicated to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexico" and the other for "Extarearos" for "Cizinci".
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in California, and all my life was called Mexican.
It's a ethnic shortcut, the same as when my friends in Boston are called "Iry" and my friends in New York mark themselves "Italy".
So after that, I ended with the "mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's house, it wasn't necessary to use shortcuts.
I was just American.
I'm speaking Spanish, enough to get out of both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I don't have a word resource of a parent speaker, and I can't get out of America's advice.
So I dropped out my American bed and set up in the front for Extarearos.
I thought about the time this week the newly chosen Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto visited the White House of President Obam.
The programme had general matters that are discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Neto also wanted to talk about the growth of the mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is the same likelihood that Mexico will stay in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block similar to the European Union in Northern America.
And Pena Neto promised that he would continue in Mexican war against drug cards, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of enemy feelings.
Most of the Americans probably never thought that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and made his leader a threat to overwrite half of the Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexico who think in the limit of the centuries, not in minutes, they are present everywhere.
So a minute after the representative of the United States will say something just a little critical about Mexico, you will hear in Mexico print and between the elite of complaints about how the Americans are involved in the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the kids of Montezumy's gone on the war road.
Yet, the real challenge for Mexico is a relationship with more than 35 million mexican people living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about enemy feelings?
They're a lot.
In Mexico, there are victories and harms, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others to whom they do not.
The only reason why so many people with Mexico roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point of our family tree, perhaps a parent or parent who had an opportunity to go north in Mexico.
And more often than it seems, this person corresponds to the profile - dark cow, weak education, p′ of the poor villages, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And although we are now living in the American dream, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live American dream, not mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unexpected, but our loyalty is not.
It's about the United States.
Yet, we realize that many elite mexicans belong to the Governing Class do not have us.
This feeling is mutual.
It seems us as when we are deceived and look at us as a subordinate race, which is not enough mexican.
Our Spanish never gets pretty good enough, our shoes to Mexico never are enough strong enough.
Our existence is, according to their opinion, only about failure.
If our families weren't missing in Mexico, they would never leave her.
And we now have not been captured for a fair opono, with a good life in the United States, but even with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajar and was legally accompanied to the United States, is implied that there is a pressure between Mexico and Mexico Americans because the Mexicans are more understanding who they are, and the Americans don't like it.
Although it is a citizen of the United States, it seems itself part of two countries.
And at the same time, many mexican Americans, I know, are not feeling part or part of one.
We love the listeners of Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best from both countries, but you don't have roots in one.
In Mexico, he looks like us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered mexican.
And to be more complicated, some mexican leaders and part of the intellectual, as I learned when I went out, want to connect to the diaspore again.
They want mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provider ambassadors" and represent mexican interests in the United States.
They should have told our American partners how great it is to visit this country and to press political leaders to deal with the relationships with Mexico.
No.
So that's going to happen.
Too many enemy feelings.
And thanks to the inequality of income and a lot of increasing corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I have a feeling that it's for you, friends.
That's fair.
At least some Mexican people are not ready to forgive the United States how they acted with Mexico ago a half a century ago, so they must accept the fact that some American Mexican people still feel new about how they were treated with their family members in a significantly closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more mexican than I thought.
Old battles, New Near East
The end of the burnt offering between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can sometimes be a permanent peace between the Arabs and the Jews on the Middle East?
Another round of bleeding indicates that each such none is missing.
Among the clothed infinite agreements about the beginning of this, many buildings were changed into business, murdered more than 140 Palestinians, civilians, and six Israelites. And the first of the rackets of Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israelites, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though it seems that the Israelites and the Palestinians have been involved in their ancient conflict, the Near East changes around them.
The Arab yarn has changed the old orders and the Palestinians and the Israelites, whether or not, they are captured in a fixed chaos in the region.
Maybe that causes their fight to be even more bloody than ever before.
Yet, there is no idea that it can interrupt their death patterns.
War that is not even won or lost.
In the first view, it seems that there are no many reasons for optimism at present.
Even if the stop of the closed fuel on November 21, the fights from this week would be forced to both sides.
The leaders of Hamasa, the Islamic movement governed in Gaza since 2007, will claim that they have made the Israelites an intervention, even when Gaza suffered the destruction.
Despite murdering some Hamas leaders and closed 1,7 million Gaza in one of the most wretched and greatest angles of the planet, Hamas was not allowed to destroy the Israelites.
And Hamas has the effect on the Western March, the next part of the Palestinian, which is currently managed by his rivals from Fatahu, the more dead palestinian fraction.
Furthermore, leaders of Hamas can be very goodly disappointed that time is on their side.
The islamists throughout the Arab world have been influenced, so Hamas has gained strong and rich friends.
Turkey, the renewed regional power, which was ever the nearest Muslim associate of Israel, was added to Hamas, as well as Katar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in Zalivia.
Clear people from Hamas say that the islamian half-month is surrounded around Israel, north of Lebanon, where the side/mile of Hizballah is governed, through Syria, where the rebels who are still closer to islamism can gather Bashara Asada to Jordan, where the associations of Hamas threaten the king.
And mainly, on the southern rock of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brothership was changed under the leading president of Muhammad Mursí in Egypt, from the greatest and lowly Arab country, equality in the region.
Hussni Mubarak, the secondary deputy, who ruled in Egypt 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, Brothership is Hamas's brotherhood and his leaders are more influential public opinions.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas can be found as a player that cannot be driven out either by Israel or by America.
Instead, the Israelites will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military termology, Hamas was reloaded into the bed.
The Israeli anti-racket system of iron cup proved its price, and many Hamas rackets were destroyed.
The Israelites can sleep better for a while.
In the diplomatic terminology, America is as inevitable as it is. Many European countries have also wined Hamas from the beginning of the last road of violence.
And mainly - Israel prospered, in particular under the leading of Benjamin Netanjahu, the president of the government, who ignored the peace process.
Although the gas rackets have killed about 30 Israelites since 2004, there was relatively quiet in Israel from self-successful bomb attackers, part of the wall, which includes the West Sea, the main part of what the Palestinian state may be once, and protects Jewish prisons that are still growing through their opposite from the international law.
The Prime Minister Netanjahu, whose side of Likud, at the beginning of the campaign, was connected to a more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman on January 22, is in a good position.
Why do we disappoint the Palestinians by giving them their own state?
Would they actually rule on the West Sea, so they wouldn't burn rackets as their lands in Gaza did?
It's gonna be better if we keep them behind the wall, and we'll put them down when he's cut off his heads.
Perhaps the guardians win strong lines, but the Arabian yarn can change their budgets.
Although the Islamics who receive power in Egypt and other countries do not have too love for Israel, their main priority will be to address home problems.
Israel’s expenditure for defence is higher than all its four Arab neighbors.
The beginning of a new war with local superpot will help new Arab governments to heal their economies.
The fact that President Mursí cooperated with President Barack Obama to reach the stop of the dust is a good sign and may mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelites should also look at the point of view.
At the time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates the oppression of the Palestinians' rights to self-determine the court with a shooting work that one day has to explode in Israel's occupied abilities - just as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
Repression is now weak in the Jewish state of democracy and demography, and this is still worse as the Arab population grows.
Blood outcomes against Gaza, which end every few years after Hamas's attack, will continue to choose a diplomatic tax.
Both sides' invitations are sounding.
The answer is what reasonable people report on both sides, the degree of the external world and these newspapers: two states where Israel is going through the security territory.
In a short view, there is a little attitude that stoping the fuel will provide pressures from the foreigner at least with a little more impact on the processing of this matter.
Egypt, who with Turkey and Katar needs to stop the delivery of weapons to Gaza, has a better position than ever else to convince Hamas to accept the idea of the Jewish State based on 1967 with the exchange of parts of the country and the shared Jerusalem.
Arabic sounds must also be pressed for the match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than without a offer of State sovereignty in the United Nations for the establishment of the Palestinian State.
President Obama also shares the way to get Israel to the acting table.
In his first electoral period, he denied the presentation of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, it seems to be similarly impressive in its entrance into the process.
Oh, that's so badly short-speaked.
America has a lively important interest in the Stability of the Middle East.
This means peaceful balance between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia has entered into force of the Law on Cigarettes
On independent green boxes that are the same for all tobacco labels, warnings for cows and sick parts of the body are shown.
The Australian laws on the worms of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind in the world, and the logs and the colors of the labels have replaced by generally green boxes with an abominable image of the diseases of the body and the visualization of children and the newborn results of their parents.
Besides different health warnings and images, the only difference between the label names that are printed with the same small letter is due from Sabbath.
It's the most precise system in the world about tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government claims that the goal is to deliver young people from smoking by delivering this crime of his attractiveness.
It is based on studies that show that if people don't start smoking up to 26 years, 99% of the chance of never start smoking.
"And in very small children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them together with their product," says the Federal Ministry of Health of Tanya Plibersek and other studies, for example, showing that children are connecting a coron in a dialogue with the idea to be a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of birds in the world and changes will only have a small impact on the profits of the overnational companies, other countries consider the introduction of steps.
The tobacco industry against the introduction of these laws was firmly lobbying.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase the trade on the black market, which would lead to lesser and more available cigarettes.
"Through this legislation it will bring to serious improper consequences," says Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco's company.
China and Indonesia are going to bring many more of these products to be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that laws have increased their trade.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the request for cigarettes from the silicone used to cover boxes, two months ago when British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco had lost their calling on the laws on the highest court of the Australian court, increased from the term of the nul sale.
Ha noted that Zico sold 6000 sales to bicycle sellers and expected new resources.
It's a good business for us.
As a potential injury, experts use the popularity of social media in the demographic group to which the plan is intended.
According to a series of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sport attitudes and demanding to cover cigarettes from direct view, the tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has prohibited the web advertising conducted by local companies and websites, but it cannot limit the websites.
"When you're a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and remains only this small space to promote your products, it's for you an incredible online space where you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a research officer in the public health university in Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman mentioned an increased evaluation of the labels on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, conducted by the "social Honzou".
We need to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves the cigarettes Marlboro and has given him the job and created this video, or is it involved in the marketing company?
The British American Tobacco's company claims that the sector was focused on how to carry out new rules rather than marketing.
The industry has been so far as it has paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the attack of new rules - the countries in the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unjustly limited, despite the fact that no of the countries with Australia is trading significantly.
The exemption of the SOO Decision is expected in the middle of 2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the Government has conducted discussions with other governments who consider similar laws on the packaging.
Canadian was the first country that took obligation to warning photos in 2001.
Now they have spread to more than 40 countries in the province of Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Great Britain, New Zealand, South Afghanistan and India are considered as harder laws.
A lot of kidneys in Australia are exhausted.
The images have no influence on me.
I just ignore them.
"You'll just take the cigarette and the box you're shooting out of the box," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photograph of the box in the mouth.
Honestly, it's just one d'you to stop smoking, and it's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, claims that by a single box, it is more difficult for him to compare the rules.
"The expenses have been for me a hour, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government should simply prohibit them completely, and then they said, "Okay, that's the end, we'll close the kram," he said and decided with his hands.
In the world of unconstant connection, it's not so bad to be disappointed
Last Day of Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours in the aircraft when our aircraft had a mechanical movement, and we had to wait for the next aircraft.
So we had a lot of time to think about the nudity.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
A half day in the airport for the next years is nice, even by spreading books, magazines and iPhon (not talking about duty-free trades).
But some doctors and experts for children's development are still more attached to appreciation of the nutrition.
They say it's good for us (and our kids) to get sometimes.
This requires the brain to go into interesting directions, which can support creativity.
And because we are still connected to a single screen today, we have no opportunity to enjoy the nuts.
So they should have supported the nausea?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
But I'll be back to that.
First, as many people, I assumed, the nudity is a relatively new evidence that has occurred with the coming of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey says, the Greek and Roman History at the Canadian University in Calgary, author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (History of Nudes) (Yale-Press, 2011).
"You have a nausea story," said he.
On the walls in Pompeach, there was a Latin signature relating to nausea, sealing from the first century of our year-life.
And then the question is how we define the nudity.
The difficulty is to be defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor psychology in York in Ontario in Canada.
After looking at research and introducing the ideas of the target group to approximately 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the nausea as a result, "I wanted to do something that would please me, but I wasn't able to do."
The nudity distinguishes by being not involved in anything but wanted to be.
He says there's no disturbance in the apath.
It says that the nutrition's nuclear is "the deterioration of the attitude process connected with the wrong injury and the feeling of a slowly deteriorating time."
The nudity can have a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a mutual relationship, they have the tendency of people to see a problem like a Property or a world, while people who are in depression see a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're crazy, when we're just getting focused.
In its study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues showed an earlier experience in which the students listened to the box on which the person read the article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a voiceless and unrelated television program in the neighborhood, others heard it so quietly that they just saw it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more nausea than the last two groups -- they had a concentration, but they were not sure why and allocated these difficulties.
When you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or difficult task, a disturbance of attention can lead to the nutrition, Mark J. Fenska, a professor of non-certainty to the Guelph in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something quiet, "as looking for bad components on the factory line, the spreading music can help you not hurt."
In the Vesheit, he said, we now know that through the assembly and the sharing, which often seems to be a sign of nudity, can help to fight and maintain people physically more careful.
"The research shows that children who are allowed to turn, learn more and keep more information than those who are needed to sit in silence," said Professor Fenska.
We've all experienced a nausea at times -- late my flight, swimming player, particularly a long-low film.
But some individuals have a greater chance to hit themselves than the final.
For help with measurement of nudity in the 80th century, "Boredom Proneness Scale" developed the "Booredom Proneness Scale".
It includes questions such as: "Multiple things I have to do, repeat and are monotonal," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do all."
With the help of these steps, boys have found that they have a tendency to offer themselves more frequently than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology in the West Florida, especially as regards the need for more and different external stimulation.
However, teenages are generally inevitable.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor for human and social development in Illinois, performed experiments in which seven to eight times daily contacted at least 400 teenages and their parents.
He discovered that 32 percent of adults were noted that they were disappointed in school and at home jobs, while 23 per cent indicated that they were hurt when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents have found that they have been disappointed.
Professor Larson said that he didn't know whether the percentage of nutrition would be now, 21 years ago, higher or lower.
But he said that he knows that "adultment is a top time for nausea", which is in significant way caused by the child and the youth has not been given a lot of control over what they want to do.
So back to my question, "It's good for you?"
As a research shows, sometimes not, because in their extreme form, people can lead to the absurd physical risk, playing hazard games, or using normal substances as a way to refresh it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between nudity and creativeness, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"The nudity is a way of brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor psychology of NYU.
But the brain doesn't know the most convenient thing you should do.
You're getting up and using this energy to play on cytarrs and kitchens, it'll make you happy.
Yet, you're going to watch the television, it'll make you happy for a moment, not for a while.
So if your child is sick and you give him iPad, he's already insufficient, but he doesn't learn how to entertain or run himself, said Professor Fenska.
And "this individual procedure is transferred from one to another," the professor said.
Your child is not just learning how to entertain himself, but it gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate the nausea.
But they shouldn't be too critical against her.
Our goal should rather be felt pleasant when we are from the achievement of an inconsistent deterioration of activity and.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We're accusing her of needing more, but the nudity is painful, unconfortable desire to be connected to something that is meaningful," he said.
What people are looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"It's hard to find ways to enjoy when the sound turns out."
There is no manual in Colorado regarding the new law on marihuana
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at higher school and abalist from South-East Colorada, commits accusation of criminal acts for something that will soon be legal in the entire state - to drive some grams of marihuana and smoke that he used for red.
Mr. Orozco said that one day of July he went with a few friends in Lamar, near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the policeman found in the Marihuan car, Mr. Orozco was issued a preliminary call for drugs and equipment to use drugs - small crimes in which there is 100 USD - and was set to him the date of the court.
"They were being treated to us as the criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In recent weeks after the vote on the legalization of a small quantity of marihuana for recreation depends on the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases rather than on the right.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana disorders were already here and in Washington, who approved similar measures.
The police department stopped accusing adults in 21 years and elderly for a small amount that will be legally allowed after the next weeks will enter into force.
But the complainants in the most conservative areas of Colorada declared that they would continue with existing cases relating to marijuana, and still accusing people of conduct.
At the same time, several cities from the area of Denver vote towards the west mountains on the prohibition of opening new, licensed trade with marihuana in their communities.
"This is so important that I don't know what will be going on," said Daniel J. Oates, the police head of Aurora, east of Denver.
They're heads of the rocks and regulators in Washington.
And they are looking for a hint to set the system of licences for planting, production, distribution and sales - all until 1st of 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or bad, is before a number of states in marihuana regulation, first for medical use and now and recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulatory market, so he will be a good leader," said Brian E.
But as you admitted, no place or system can do more than to do what might work.
"There is no precedens which they could be conducted," said he.
The Washington Law, I-502, is obtained by 6.
And there are noteworthy mechanical issues that must be resolved during this time, for example, how to export a State Directive on "compatibil access" to licensed marihuana with its prohibition of trafficking with canopy up to 330 metres from schools, parks, children or children's centres.
"Nowhere more difficult to place a licensed trade with cannabis than in towns, especially in the metropolitical Seattle," said Ben Livingston, the Legal Canopies Center, recently founded research groups.
On November 21, the police officer Oates from Aurora sent his e-mail officers, in which he told them that the citizen's complainant had already been to deal with crimes for a small quantity of marihuana at every 21 years older citizen and that the police "with immediate validity" would stop the accusation of people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would promote town laws regulating medical marijuana pesticides and continue to spend drug buyers and dealers.
During the Weld period in North Colorado, the periodic prosecutor Ken Buck represents a closer view.
After voting, he announced that his office would continue to carry out cases of marihuana, often as a way to press the architectural to seek treatment.
Currently, there are 56 grams of accusation or less marijuana 119 people, even though many of them face further accusations.
"Our office is required to curse a criminal offence that was criminal acts at the time when it came to them," Mr. Buck said in his statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places such as the foreign period of Mesa, where the electors rejected the marihuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the period that adults have no longer been charged with a small amount.
The Periodic Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but has also decided not to refuse all the current cases of driving.
"I don't think I'm losing my time by continuing to promote the rights until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of colored electors have supported measures, the introduction of recreation marihuanas to the government and legal system has never been easy.
And the contradictive reactions in addition to the State have dealt with this large state-green experiment with the deep divergence between local officers.
For the periodic prosecutors, this is "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the complaints of marijuana, and the local speaker of the National Organization for the Reform of Marihuana laws.
"They have so much of their lives in the way of the people, that they can't still accept that it is legal," he said.
As the first states that have a small quantity of marijuanas as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best way to be national testing cases for legalization of drugs.
Delegates and States authorities plan new borders for legalised sales and, at the same time, they are expecting the instructions from the federal government, which are still in view of the sale and promotion of marihuana as federal crimes.
The legalization of marijuana hopes that the Ministry of Justice will vote.
Despite a few arrests of marihuana sellers for doctors and patients who use it, the federal government left trade with medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and other 16 countries in the operation.
While anti-drogue agents are probably trying to express the door to catch a small drug sack, it is likely that they will be enabled by the State of regulated trades with recreation marihuana permitted by new laws, Kevin A. Sabet, former adviser in the anti-drogue policy of President Obama.
A number of towns in Colorada don't expect the procedure of federal authorities.
Before the election day, some local governments have approved the moratory for any new trade with marihuana, although it will take about a year before any trade is able to be opened.
Last week Montrose, on the west of the state, has been a half-year prohibition and is likely to enter into force the next week.
"We don't want to feel like we give a license to someone and then we'll have a great federal matter," said Bob Nicholson, member of the city Council.
Our community voted against this.
We are looking at what the province was voting for, instead of what he refused to be.
There's a lot of questions here.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was invited to leave Oxford because I'm a conservator."
Their views have not only been attacked by university students today.
I don't remember that I'd never do a study at Oxford University.
Like my father, so my elder brother studied at the university, which I thought it was the biggest world seat of depression, the modern Greek singing symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thoughts and tolerance.
And at the end of the 80th century to two weeks after I came to Worcester College, where I wanted to study the story, I packed the cookies and returned to the first scandal of my life.
My father wounded up and wept.
My friends were deceived.
The Evening Standard dated that I had delivered it because I had a match against the love of students in the neighborhood room.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced distressfully that I was gone because I was needed to drink out of the throats.
The truth was less comic.
I'm running.
Yeah, I fled because I was the subject of systematic shinning and fearing.
Not because of my somewhat strange name or my personality that I came from a private school.
I was investigated from the only damn and in this college of the famous lighting it was as bigotic, so barbaric: my father, the deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was highly established by Margaret Thatcher's adviser and I was the prosecutor Conservative of the page.
You can ask yourself why I'm taking it out right now.
Only because the last reports indicate that the new generation of students suffers from the middle of similar tracking.
The institutionalized and growing hatred to preserve students in Oxford is so big that a group of these students has been aware of the same protection of equal rights as gay, health-situation and ethnic minorities last week.
Conservation of members of the Juvenile Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claims that they are "frequently actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and shown that they are not welcomed".
They request the creation of a position in the University Committee for Equal opportunities that would ensure that their opinions can be freely communicated.
Their documentary order BBC Two has not helped them even recently mentioned in the Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Bright Land: Young, Intelligent, Intelligent and Right) on a student political action, which the conservator has calculated as strangers and neonacists.
In order it was represented absolutely Joe Cooke, former President Oxford _ Conservative_tion (conservates the Oxford University Association - OUCA), who led Rolls-Royce, was dressed in silver clothes and had a cup with silver head.
In other high schools, students say that they have been deemed to be “offened lambs” from the introduction of higher schools.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice-president Nottingham _ Conservative _BAR_ (conservate_ the Nottingham University Association), said to the Monday newspapers that "levetic impact on universities grow.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club, without to meet us at all."
The 11-year-old historian student of Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands behind the movement of the protection, says that such climate is "incomprehensible", while the nineteenth-year-old president of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the access of JCR members from the middle of people, it has occurred to deterioration.
"It represents a threat to the intellectual debate atmosphere, as well as to the good life exchanges of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I arrived in September 1986, 18 years old and protectively.
Hate to Conservate was the worst.
The University announced the refusal to grant the honorable title of the former student Margaret Thatcher's in the financing of high school.
The atmosphere would also be scared by stalinists.
During the first few days of the early week, when new students were associating with themselves and with the professionals, I got to make a peline that was supposed to come.
I found that not only the Professors of the silence authorize the rubber of conservative bullets, but also with a pleasure.
The wood of the listeners has been introduced in the policy of horn staff, privatisation and government opposition against sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first advice was about the translation of the French text from the 18th century to English and I was not prepared for what was followed.
"Mrs. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now sleeping), " Please add the first paragraph."
I thought it was pretty tired.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a dart tea, was very yellow.
"Thatcherovs refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" asked he.
Other students moved.
My tears were cut into my eyes.
"I want you to take such a French basic lesson in your free time, so if you are not too busy with the social issues," rejected Professor Pitt.
I was thrown back to my room.
At the school dinner, I was sitting alone when I felt a light shit on my arm.
He was a second-year-old student named James, who represented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," said heavyly.
Unfortunately.
Everyone who is suspicious of the conservation is a thieve.
It's bad enough for me, but they think your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be worse for you.
Most conservative elements suggest that they are aware.
After I was in the local economy, I was trying to be in the town.
I was keeping that I didn't agree with all what Thatcher said.
This trick appeared to be a failure.
Student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economy, who walked on Eton, said, "You're the daughter of the fascist scepter."
You're killed.
Other students noted him.
I was disgusting, spying.
"How do conservators love?" asked one.
They're kidding each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before liberal legislation of the sixty years.
Could I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Should I be forced to meet like thinking people just after sharing?
Should I change in the art and throw my natural clothes?
Three years before me, they developed as a cleaner of ignorance and isolation.
The only discovery to keep a professor was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who sat on my university.
He was hated not only because he was preserving them, but also because he was Margaret Thatcher's adviser for the Policy of Employment and one of those who write their words.
It wasn't there.
This place hated for his provincy and malignity and for his decline to marxistick-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he went to the place of a professor at the Bilkent University in the Turkish Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I started coming from Oxford to my parents' home in London, looking for a camp at my unexpected metropolitical friends and families.
I told fathers I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his study at Oxford in four years, all political views were adopted.
"But it's the best place in the world," said pateticly.
They wouldn't do that, not a dream in the city.
Even my communist friends had perfect ways.
His loud eyes were laughing.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a jart.
I'd break my heart if you'd go.
My emotional distress was worse with a frequency of running out to London.
My friend, also the prosecutor of Conservating the party, pressed and gave up his conviction.
The next week in the course of the learning, when the next professor of the story said that I was the enemy of people, I decided to do the same.
Even when I was inside the red hole, I admitted that my parents had a brain, and I called them "old fools."
The destruction was only a short time.
My oxford career's fucked my father in the cancer.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week in Murdoch's newspaper.
My doors were locked.
I got baptized inside, and after five minutes my trackers gave it.
When they left, I was packing my cow and capturing the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a dark weak.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such fear and food in the educational establishment.
However, it was more tragic that Oxford, from which 14 conservative premises were not only taken, but also hidden for an unworthy story of equality and freedom of thinking.
"Valentino's nice to be electionary than glory."
At the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Modern Creation", which was started this week in London, ABC spoke with Nata Abscalala, Fionou Thyssen-Bornemis and other famous Italian farmers.
Somerset House, an ancient residence of Isabela I. ه., is the only place in the British main town that is nice to visit the Valentina Garavaniho exhibition.
In the beginning of the celebrative retrospective "Valentino: Master of Mode Creation", he confirmed this, which represents more than 130 models of top mode created by his atelier in the last 50 years.
"This lock I love," he says with his inchanging Italian advantage.
This exhibition is the conclusion of the story, in which "Il" Garavani is the only protagonist that could not be written without his honoured customer.
Valentino felt obscured by rare and remote world aristocracy.
By the exhibition room that takes up until 3 March, it overtakes private correspondences and photos with signatures of most important slechtics, from Princess Salimy Aga Chan through the Greek Princess Marii-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exposes these personal initiatives as the trophes of its community upstairs: from the free circle from Voghera to north Italy to the idol of the international "Good Smetters".
Having the king's family is nothing wrong.
"They won't at least cut a cigarette cigarette into a beautiful cow, as they do some beautiful pop-music celebrities," says the Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemis.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in Al’h, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an effective host, and guests enjoy a lot and a election.
"All of us were very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstaadu," explains the ex wife "Heini's" Thyssena and the close friend of the forgotten beauty like Marella Agiya or Eugene Niarchos.
"Valentino had a ra ra'i electant than the glory.
And it's from the star."
Valeria Mazzova leads Valentina
The charism of the architecture doesn't look forward to the argentin model Valeria Mazzova.
"It's for years that we went to him for dinner after one watch in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were twenty and between us was Sharon Stone and John Kennedy younger.
In every degree of his apartment, exciting, eating, music, in all things, he turned away and felt his spirit.
All invitations to him could have felt important and loving," the top model began to work with him during the time of the Paris week in 1995.
"He will never get out of the mode, because his nayes are artistic works," he advises.
Birthday Viewer
Gravani's life is not the story of the ownership, but the reality of the oppressed love.
He loves people with good education and best titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House gallery was stopped at a particular seventy metres of passport that offers a exchange of role: visit changes to a model and comes to passports to observe the "neighborhood" of the dreams that Valentinov's master works as clothes chosen by Jackie Kennedy at his wedding with Aristotele Onassis, the bone who had Monica Vitti in "Night", or a cabout of the wall and the skin, which belonged to Castle Farah Diba.
In the public, the manic is named Sibilla Lucemburska, Gloria from Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norska, Rosario Bulharska or Soige Habsburska.
Naty Abascal and farmer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "not forget."
"I'll take it completely.
They were caillotes, shoes, news "gillette" and a sack from the winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the muscles.
"I give him the final priority for his women and love for women because he undermines our beauty," adds the former leader of Feria.
"I like the colors that he uses, that makes it very clear and gives the faces of "screen".
Proportions are perfect."
Even the princess and modal icon Patricia della Giovapaola d'Arenberg can't forget how you first dressed Valentina.
When she was growing up and lived in Italy, she wanted to be full-year-old and have the opportunity to dress one of his dinner clothes...
Finally, she was expected at the end of the 90s.
"I bought my first clothes from Valentine for the opportunity of celebration at my brotherhood, Prince Edouarda de Ligne.
It was the red clothes that had shoes with a call, a drawn animal, and a cover without a brain.
"It was a dream that became a dream," says the widow after Rodrigu d'Arenberg.
"Valentino's lax to mode, his washing is overtime," explains the Italian aristocratic whose life seems between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has saved the festival clothes "very carefully... because clothes are not just clothes, it's also a file of embrace that has in it."
Mode "King"
The golden cup of exhibitions in Somerset House are wedding clothes Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding with Paul Greek in 1995.
For the creation of these fabrics of slonovine colors with all pearls, twelve types of different parts and four and a half meter were required for four months of work and 25 "boys" (as called the farmer of his squadlene).
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of specialized pressure, represents these clothes a top mode limit in the end of the 20th century, "the return of the client from the high company".
Valentino is now his best example during the years of elite "savoir-ster".
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest announcement in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and known by the Order of Honest Legi crosses so much poet as any of his customers' husbands.
"My attention has attached his choice, calm, fixed and perfect view," recognized princess d'Arenberg.
"I've seen him a month ago at the gala dinner in the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Jacqueline de Ribes, my big girlfriend.
He was unusual, the time did not leave him any track."
When Princess says that...
The strongest thing in the world: wearing sire in a cave Kawah Ien
After four euros, wearers in Indonesia are risked with their lives and health when wearing 70 kilograms of serum down on slight stone roads.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and they are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 corners, which makes it to live by obtaining sire from the Kawah Ien soap on the east of the Indonesian island of Yava.
That is why every day the fabric to the bottom of the corner, where silver gases are avoided from the inside of the Earth and when the air is contacted, it has to go into a fixed state.
Following the exhaustion of the big serum blocks weighting up to 70 kilograms, it refers to the ram in two bambus bottles on the covered stone roads.
To the top of the coat, which is 2 386 metres, it is only 250 metres, but the wearing wears take over 40 minutes before they go up with the iron temper up, because they keep the balance and consider their steps reasonably not to disturb and fail to lose.
They know that any distress could happen to life, as happened to one French tourist who came from Kawah Ien scale years ago.
Coasts in Kawah Ijen makes five cents for each kilo serum that wins
When they are up, they take the way around tourists who photograph them, like ops in the cycle, and they fascinately carry hard bags to the weight that the carrier company placed on something below, at the oversea height of 1850 meters.
It's the company PT Candi Ngrimb, which has been weak since 1960 and has never paid its employees more than 662 Indonesian rupes (5 cents) per kilogram of sire.
Then it is sold for 10 000 rupies (83 cents) to petrochemical industrial, because this nerve has its place in the daily life and is used for the production of fuel, entertainment pyrotechniks, cosmetics, dynamics and even for sugar bleeding.
"Because we are running 70 kilos, we'll make about 46,000 rupes (3,8 euros) for each road," Anto explains us, which usually takes three roads daily.
One road takes three hours and is finally destroyed, but it can make 138 000 rupies (11.5 euros) per day.
Although it seems to be an insufficient amount for such an unsupported effort, it's threefold of what he would do on the field.
"The daily salary of the coffee is very high here. For example, for a collection of coffee 15,000 rupies (1,2 euros) per day and for fourteen days is two million rupies (167 euros)," explains the nose that worked before on the Bali tourist island as a wall.
His payment was 75,000 rupias (6,2 euros) for day and work was not so hard, but Anto returned to his family to Banyuwangi, the village near the soup, from a severe damn that is in Indonesia as convinced as sira: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is Hinduist, and I took her to Yava to convert to Islam."
Anto has astma, he's wrong breathing, he's still crazy, and his eyes's adequate toxic gases
In its 27 - year - old Anto risks life in Kawah Ijen's soap, whose seed has already started to choose its tax, although his face is protected by special mask and brilliant.
He's astma, he's wrongly breathing, he's still crazy, and his eyes's throat toxic gases that avoid the soaps.
That's the price he needs to pay for getting his dream.
"I'll work for two years, because I want to open the business or study Spanish or French," he promises more than an approximate English.
This sympathic and intelligent young man who is accused of a court could be a tourist, a coach or a reception at the hotel, and instead, he works a carrier.
He shares a spine tree chatch with other wearers and each day rises in two hours, because she doesn't stop exhausting the night, and its characteristic yellow color changes into blue and darkness.
Even in the surrounding darkness of Anto in the corner, and it lights the path of the light that he has on the helm and he himself bought it for his money.
Approximately 400 wearers are packing on the back of the cart with a seed from the bottom of the cartridge
Although the company has high income, the weight of the silver has not mixed the cost reductions, nor does it provide the wearers working for their own plants and with such efforts, any equipment.
In fact, not enough is a part of 30,000 rupies (2,5 euros) of the photography additive, which together with 15,000 rupies (1,2 euros) selects the guards of the natural park from tourists who come to photograph their soap and its human mules.
"This work is for the cattle, not for the people," urges Madrusin, a 42-year-old weapon who works in Kawah Ien for three decades, since he left school.
He can lift up up to 110 kilos and make us sure he'll keep working, "what longer it's going to go," because he's money for his three sons in the course of 18 to 10 years.
I'm not going to the entrance, I'm gonna die here because the soap was my whole life.
Although the grass burns fiercely and wheat in the eyes, when the wind turns unexpectedly and swallows the horns in the woods of the woods that rise from the rocks, the winds are so claimed that no one of them suffers serious diseases... it is evident of their frequent respiratory pressures, arthroses, knees pain, and wounds on the arm of your packs.
The unit that considers his trash on his back can be charged only 50 kg in his 53 years.
Each day, he and his colleagues devote 15 tons of syringe, which then three trucks carry a straight road between the towns in terms of Tamansari 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to the entrance, I'll die here because the soap was my whole life," announced Uninik and then opened a wide mouth in which a few teeth miss.
From his five sons, the oldest, the thirty-year-old, he also makes the depth of the sire.
The time goes, but the constant distress of one of the most difficult parts of the world survives from generations to generations - the terms that perform human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore shakes a child to save the economy
Singapores do not have children, career, stress and costs for living and education.
"The population of Singapore grows."
I'm married and I'm a owner, you're my wife and you're a owner.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of the advertising of mental bonbons, but yet - or maybe so -- the video has been spread massively at YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
These are parts of the rape that uses the local boxes of the type "we give a bullet in the trumpet" as a smile of birth measure in Singapore.
The BBH Advertising Agency, who created videos, hopes that this advertising will be able to warn them about the problem in a funny way.
The artificial director of the Agency Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the effect of music for people to fulfil their "civil obligation".
"It's extremely about the Internet matter, so it must have been fun and fun.
It's the biggest problem of this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt that it was the theme we need to touch.
We knew that the government tried to spread a lot of things like the pheromy parphome or organize a listing party.
Many of these ideas could be creative, but not completely lowly.
So we thought why not do the most creative thing of my thing, such as putting up rap, and they solved this problem."
1.2 Children
The one who doesn't take it too easy to weight is the Singapore government.
A yearly charge of 1.300 USD to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 for a child, extends the mother's allowance and allocates financial doses.
All these measures had a little effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with growth in Southeast Asia, also known by the conservation of its representatives and the intense social controls.
The measure of birth in Singapore as regards the distribution of the population is currently 1.2 children for a woman.
Consequently, the proportionality of the value 2, which is considered as a renewal measure in 1976.
Why do the Singapores actually have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the Committee of Marriage and the National People's Office's Family, says that it is because of "better education" and "widespread scale of career opportunities".
"The people have so much more opportunities in relation to life's goals and priorities, it is not only marriage and family," explains.
These changes in the Community standards have contributed to increase the number of free people and to delay marriage and children's birth.
While in the immigration policy, drasticks had an effort to increase the impact of immigrants as measures against the decreasing number of people, this caused disapproval among local residents.
On some Singapore web sites, it is to see uncovered xenofobie against many new promotors, especially Chinese who are criticized for maintaining low payments and a small attempt to integrate.
Increasing immigration has also been considered as one of the parties, why the Governing Party of Singapore has mentioned its worst choice result from the beginning of independence.
After elections, the effort was to solve a problem through quota and higher taxes for the job.
Unexpected results
While the decrease of birth has a famous impact on national economic growth, tax income, health expenditure and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there were also certain unexpected results.
The government's trying to get so many small houses.
She, for example, began to influence the trafficking of injustices.
The Office for Civil Development began to regulate the number of small apartments known as "boot boxes" that can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 meters of quarter and have great success in sale.
However, fear is that these apartments can support youth life and reflect developments to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Development Company EL ́ers, claims that their "boot boxes" are selling far more than houses.
"They're more famous, and so they're selling for days to weeks more than houses with greater divorce.
That is why our money flow is much better."
However, it admits that new standards set out clearer rules to developers that were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could mean to increase the population's birth, the discussion with the Singapore workers in the financial quarter in the center of the city indicates that they have a great effect.
"The people are still in stress, the houses are dear, as well as education, so many people dismiss it," says the young officer.
"Let the others have children.
But it's important for me to pay my own money and time," says another, about twenty-year-old, young man.
Men and women mention career, stress, and costs for living and education as a dada that prevents them from having children.
So whatever the government tries to citizens in any way to have children, they are the same at the end of the Singapore who have regard to the establishment of the family's last word.
What is private offline is private and online
Private.
According to the dictionary issued by the Kingdom Spanish Academy, it is something that has a personal view or "the area of privacy which every person has the right to protect against any violation".
What is this private for a 16-year-old man?
How does this definition apply in its daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the danger that it is exposed to when he publishs the matters on the Internet that he would absolutely tell no one in the current communication?
The journalists from elPeriódico replied five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years of age, who are often internet operators.
In four cases, they viewed the concept of privately as "a whole own" in the personal area and as "username and password" in relation to the social network.
"I would not publish the biggest secret," says decade Jorge in trying to explain the importance of privacy in places such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been two years old.
"It's a very secret secret, my mother can talk about them, but not the whole world," he says.
"I'm giving nice or nice to the FBI how we're playing.
I'm talking to those known there too.
I wouldn't share a thing that wouldn't be my, or a thing that would smile someone," he says.
This boy realizes that it is bad to publish obscene photos, photos of naked persons or pictures of crimes, or to write humiliating or brutal comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends who are on the FBI and his nine clients on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
There's between them and a mother who has a name and a password of one of them.
"I put it on Twitter so I could express my opinions and write interesting articles.
I don't know if someone answers me, I'm just giving them there," he adds.
"Social networks are funny, I can talk to families who are far or communicate with friends," he says.
Without weight, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even interest him if someone recommended him a stranger.
The 14-year-old case of José is different.
This teenager own properties on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks admits that he does not know 20 people from his friend list.
"I have no fear because we have something common, for example music," he says.
According to this guy, no one of them had to put him on anything, nor wanted him to have a address or a phone number.
"If they'd beat me or ask me for it, it's simple to remove them from their face," he admits.
José logged in to Ask after reading recommendations on Twitter.
This boy is not an alien experience with what is called cyberbullying (cyberchikana).
"There were a famous friends on the social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who he was," he confirmed.
The victim has not been denied according to José.
"Only activated private mode."
Then it explains a series of steps how to set safely.
By the end of Jorge, this boy would publish those known in inappropriate or trapful events.
"Of course I'd do it if someone would like me or would just want me.
Even if I know it's cyberbullying," it says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porrasová, the professor of English and the Resolution of Vögov's arm and learning, has to make children and adults in social networks a good orientation, need to understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform them.
It states: "Internet has appeared as a search for information, but when the social network has appeared, the rules of games have changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that the academic worker Marc Prensky, the absolute pedagogic at Yale University and the author of the article Digital Homer and Digital Promotors, introduced these ideas to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital homeborn are children and young people who were born during this time.
We're digital movers that we have to learn, and then we're just teaching ourselves," he says.
It explains that it's a complex topic, "for we ask them to discern what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what not, when they are not grown up."
It adds to be a favorite, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the challenges.
According to this specialist, it is the most effective way to show children and adults what it is private, to ask questions that need to think.
"Tell them to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Moreover, Marrielos Porras' names some of the options: are things you wouldn't tell the foreigner, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would it be your pleasure if someone published your mother as you published a friend?
Do you know what the finals are publishing about you?
When you mark persons at the celebration, did you ask these persons for authorisation?
And another: do all of us need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to realize that they have to be in the Internet at the same time as outside.
They're the same rules.
"A man outside the Internet is conducting respect, moral and other principles, and it should be the same on social networks," he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university teacher, teacher at the first degree and educational adviser, explains that it is necessary for parents to carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If they understand every matter, they have a good basis to talk to children about research that can have on the Internet.
For example, as regards the square or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
Guardia is thinking that it is key to the child's traditional rule "no talking to strangers".
Summary South America ends and Lima's declaration has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South America (Unasur) held in Peru today has been completed without being published an advertising declaration from Lima, which was evidently signed by seven present presidents.
The Efe Agency tried repeatedly to get access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the States heads and Governments of the United States, but the representatives of the Ministerial offices, which at the beginning determined that the document was published after the summary, stated that it would be published later on the Peru Government's websites.
They further stated that the content was published by the Peruan President Ollant Humala in a number of short print statements.
The journalists had limited access to information throughout the summary.
During the debate, videos from the presidential meeting were transferred in the print room without sound with the report "Confidential meetings, sound transfers".
A small quantity of information available to journalists was invited by the printing speakers of some governments who were present, however, not to Peru speakers.
The only document published during the negotiation was the list of presidents, which caused new hundreds of journalists from different national and international media that requested more information.
After ́i, the Peruan presidential office has sent the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is only the statement of President Humaly, not the official document that the summit has closed.
Last October, Peru’s third summit of South America and Arabic countries (America del Sur-Países Arabes, ASPA) host was not published and at this opportunity, even though the print was bitterly requested.
The ASPA official pages can be checked that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruan Authority tried to ensure sending for all journalists, but completely reduced information.
Summit ended outside another common commitment to Chile and Peru to adopt the Court of Justice of Hague, which resolves the border between both countries.
President Peru Ollanta Humala and Chairman Chile Sebastián Piñera met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in Haag, which will take place on Monday to hear the disputes of both parties to negotiate the dispute that Lima started against Santiagu.
"We need and do the judgment that will resolve the dispute we negotiate today in this international court," President Humala said together with his Chile Protestant.
"Chile was, it was, and the country would be respecting international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, conventions and international courts," Pinner added and welcomed President Humalu with his hands at the flag of both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents of the decision of the International Court of Justice was published after the adoption of this week of the Boote Pacte, which expressed details with the judgments of the International Court decided on the maritime ambitions with Nikaragu, and Colombia considered this decision to be completely wrong.
Summit was found without the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was removed from the United Sur organisation in 2011 after the call of the president Fernanda Luga, and the meeting was not attended.
The host president Ollanta Humala was conferred on the beginning of the early words and the summit in Lima shortly after the midnight.
The President read the final document in which he informed that 16 agreements were adopted and was planned for 31 projects between South America, with 17 billion dollar investments.
In addition to the agreements adopted, UNASUR's Member States have "the important steps towards the purpose of the South America citizen's form to which the residence agreements are extended".
He informed that measures are supported to improve "the promotion of civil impatience and internationally organized crime, the improved availability of medicines and leaving Internet in all corners of South America and the common and common measures against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in the crisis, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) has no victory base, but it has to serve to expand our productivity and to show our nations a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to predict a group of 31 symbolic projects that improve the transport connections of different places in South America, especially foreign and foreign places... to better connect our countries and create new economic links," said the Peruan president in the reading statement.
He changed that five of these projects were related to Peru and its neighbouring axes from the coast to Brazil, and the other two related to better connection with Ecuador, however, he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched the political action in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country serves to return to the Union of South America nations," which is currently removed.
The next issue that the summit raised was that Latin America continues to be prosperous and peaceful, which is celestial and has a good neighborhood relationship.
In this regard, Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos said before his regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaragua Proteine Daniel Ortego in Mexico on the Sabbath to negotiate with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the dispute on the marine border, which is suspicioned by God.
"It is likely to meet President Daniel Ortego tomorrow (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We negotiate all the solutions, no one has been broken out, nor with Nikaragua, which would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I will be able to say to the President of Ortegos, and the acts have led the most civilised and incompletely in my form," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega are meeting in Mexico on Saturday, where they are to participate in the Dark President Enrique Peñi Niety.
In the summit, the EU Defence Ministers have seen preliminaryly to approve the Action Plan for 2013, seeking to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the matter of defence.
The members of the UNASUR organization are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay, although the latest country mentioned is currently deleted.
Peru is a temporary president of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
The Equatorial President Rafael Correa has announced today that the creation of a common citizen is the goal in which "the South America, in this case of reality, must take place from Europe".
Correa, who was held at the sixth presidential summit of the South America National Union (Unasur) in Lima, stated in the state TV Peru TV that the Europeans were killed for the Second World War and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one government".
In this regard, the project of the creation of South America citizens supported by the Member States of Unsur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South-American country that is already running between the members of the Andes Community, however, still exists from the economics that want us to return to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuador Chairman stated that the agreement with the transcoup of the United States Organization (OAS) would be undermined that the impact of the English States would be reduced and that those who signed the Pacte of San José on Human Rights would be taken into account.
"They who are in the head are never committed to anything, and we the South Americaans, however, sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Interame’s Human Rights Commission is financed in Washington by the United States," stated the political asylum of the Ecuador-based WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
The President Correa confirmed that this decision was not denied because I did not deliver my principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "is there a deep suspicion that Assange could be issued to the third country without regard to the running process".
Furthermore, he criticized the Swedish Justice, which requested him to make a vote on the Swedish territory due to a given sexual delicity, while "the own Swedish legislation allows the votes of video-conference talk that could be performed from the Ecuadoral Welfare in London".
Correa noted that there was a risk that Assangeh would take place in a deterioration of physical and mental health.
"I haven't talked to him since a while what's on our high-slaveness, but she has very proudly informed me that she has a little plumb, but nothing serious," said the Equadorian Head of the State.
"But it's dangerous that his physical and mental state is worse because it's closed on a small space without the possibility of moving on fresh air.
"It would notice the health of everyone," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the Assange asylum presented from June on the Equatorial Welfare of London on the basis of an authorisation that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hand of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European Courts, and stressed that the discussions had been held with London to solve the arrest of the founder WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but we continue to talk.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of British, Sweden and European Courts, because the lawyer Baltazar Garzón of Assange has a series of management in various European institutions," he changed.
He said, "When British is released tomorrow, everything will end."
And if Sweden Mr. Assange listens to the Equatorial Majesty in London or through Skype, how it allows dark legislation without a problem and how it has been implemented in other cases, this problem will be ended tomorrow."
Correa used this operation to present himself as a defensor of print freedom, and explained that he definitely does not tolerate "subdirection, wrong intentions and lies that undergrave freedom of expression".
The biggest enemies of free pressure are not we, we're aware of politics, but bad journalists in the service of profit, pressure and exhibition," he said.
In this regard, he expressed the pleasure that neither such journalists, nor bankers, nor hegemon countries, nor burgeases control Ekvador, would say that if it was selected again, "they will continue to change the right path and the right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed in Paraguay about the membership of the Union in Unsur at least in its next elections and argued that "the whole must be strong and tolerable opportunism and puchism attached to legality", because "the legitimateness of the Paraguay Democracy".
In addition, the Ecuador Chairman said that he considered "too appropriate" the desire of his Colombian protest Juan Manuel Santose to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime relations between both countries now, in the time of the judgment of the International Court of Justice in Haag, who decided in the benefit of Nikaraguy.
The sentence is currently not accepted.
"It's a problem between the Southame and the Central Country.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be convinced that the will of shortage together.
It's necessary to test the width to be convinced and it's the opportunity to go forward."
Moreover, he expressed on a consequence of the marine border, which resolves at the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "the Latin America is right to search for a international instance if both countries are entrusted to adopt a judgment, whether it is strong."
With regard to the possibility of candidating in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to be held in the order for the third mandate, he noted that he had this option "with great optimism and joy, even though it was sometimes very difficult".
Correa announced that if the elections are lost in February 2013, it will leave public life.
"I was never interested in my personality, but so injustices, such as socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador, can only be acquired of political powers.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guarantees this probably victory, so we have to accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I win, it would be my last president's period and then I'd go out of the policy.
When we lose it, it's waiting for me.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also changed about the new health treatment of Venice president Huga Chavez in Cuba.
"I just talked to the Venezuelan vice-president Nicolas Madura, who says that President Chavez went on a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign was completed.
It's not about the recidives in the health status of the president," he explained.
The head of the Equatorial State has now participated in the sixth sum of the State head and the Governments of the Union of South America (UNASUR), which was committed by the challenges of further regional integration for the deterioration of development, equality and security.
The victims of AIDS are a study of late diagnosis today
Fabrizi was 21 years old when the outcome of his test was confirmed: HIV position.
"It was as if the black hits me," she reported at the time of the truth that the doctor tried to "smell a little", but apparently without success.
The boy secreted it before his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own beds and began to inform about it, and it was so sad that he had celebrated the 43th birthday.
It is certainly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit in the Citizen’s Sickness in Guadalajar (HCG), which came in 1994 after a number of disease threats.
Fabrizio lives with a virus of human immunodeficiency (HIV) since 22 years, which was something unrepresentable at the beginning of the 90s, when there was many doubts, less opportunities to treat and more grades.
Then neither the manager of the clinic of the Mexico Social Security Institute (IMSS) dismissed him, "because he had a huge".
At that time, having AIDS was a synonym of death.
Now it's possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
Nevertheless, there are many people who don't know their illness and guard until the virus caused the body's destruction and enhanced the immune system, and then remain victims of accidental infections.
31 years ago since AIDS disease has occurred in the world, or at least from the first documented cases, "the great success that the length of a patient's life, which is at times and appropriately being treated, is the same as in healthy people," Jaime Andrade Villanueva, leader of HIV in the Civil Hospital of Guadalajar, stated that this information was confirmed in April of the year in a prestigious publication.
The HIV/AIDS infectionologist and specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that the doctors have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death trial, but that survival and full-valuable life depends on the degree of imunitary system of patients who are infected, while those who do not use drugs are better: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and 500 CD4-50-cells.
It simply means that the person who has HIV in 25 years of age can, according to these knowns, "live without problems up to 75 years of treatment," explained the doctor in the discussion.
To highlight this progress, it is appropriate to note that the average length of Mexico's lives is now 76 years.
Although death has been significantly decreased in the past years and in Mexico, the number of people who died for AIDS has increased from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (the United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that AIDS has been destroyed in accordance with national = 60 per cent of patients.
Only in Jalisco, 255 persons died in 2011 and until the year May 187. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirus has been guaranteed.
- Why do people still die for sickness?
- "I don't think the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
That's what I see, so that's what's going on in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we haven't exhausted the medical resources. The problem is that patients are in a very advanced stage because they don't know the situation of an accident or in the latest stage of disease."
It adds convinced data: "9 of the ten patients comes when an associated infection is already present. The only thing you need to do is more to affect the total death, is a disease to earlier, and therefore you need to offer tests to detect disease to all who ask for them."
In his advice, specialists and officers of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco and directly with patients such as Fabrizio, who came to let tests in a private laborer only because he did his friend, and even through his low illness of AIDS, and also suffered by Caposi sarcom, a natural disease, which is one of the habitual complications.
"All will change if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're dead, and they don't want to do anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I better go three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was to be better, healthy food, practical, medication."
His parents know only that he suffered from cancer until today.
"I live a normal life like everyone.
I work, I have a lot of activity, my journey, I lead active sexual life, but responsiblely, I give attention to myself and to the other person," Fabrizio, who has taken the challenge to share his experience with MILENIO JALISCO journal, to motivate his witness to those who are afraid today in the World Day of AIDS.
"Let them do tests. If they risk, let them know if they are HIV positive, it's better, and if they've already been able to realize that they can live as anyone else when they're responsible."
This message contains the password of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Desktop Condoms
There is a big disaster between health programmes and current citizens, stated Ricardo Salazar, a guadalajar journalist who finds information about HIV virus.
And the biggest areas are in prevention.
In places in which this task is "the increased condom distribution, one or two gave us before, today gives us packages and hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most advanced to new advice are adults.
"What do you want?" is a running question full of ironie and consideration from social workers, school advisers, doctors and health personnel, which adults want to avoid, says the reporter.
He proposed this ineffective division to change. The condoms are not only behind the boxes, but the hundreds are located in the dozens on public stations, in places where young people often go.
"This is not the support of promiscuity.
It doesn't even "pay beer and motel" to them, as Emily González responded to the question whether he would agree with the distribution of preservatives during his period.
It's the best to access condoms to those who already lead sexual life," he noted.
Key numbers in Jalisco State
13 435 cases (12 158 AIDS cases and 1 317 HIV cases).
This state means the fourth place in new and detected AIDS cases in Mexico and 13 places in relation to HIV.
92% of the injury runs through the sexual path, 6% of the creation and 2% periodically.
It is estimated that he can live about 50 thousand people with HIV virus, because for one registered case there are four to five people who do not know the disease.
The sentence approved by the revocation of the United States court, which does not recognize the restructuring of the debt of the Group Vitro complainant in Mexico, calls for any national business with refugees in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
It seems therefore that the procedures for restructuring fires that allow mexican laws do not apply to international agreements in countries and stars.
The approval of the sentence issued on June 15 of the past year by Judge Harline Halem at the court of the North Texas shall leave Mexican company in practice without defense against the possibility of confiscation of their ownership on the second side of the river El Bravo.
However, the sentence opens the main Mexican producer a door to the Supreme Court of the United States with a revocation against three inequalities.
It is necessary to say that while the judge of this castle claims that the credentials have the right to carry out the in-law of the United States, the Court of Justice of the Fifth Period with the seat in New Orleans says that the main procedure is setting the competitive procedure in Mexico.
Firstly, this would indicate the ignorance of international processing cooperation in cases of incidence of transnational undertakings.
In principle, the model law of the United Nations for the Association of International Commercial Rights, which is designated by the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the sentence states that without voting on the internal enterprise structure, when the debt of Vitro's mother company is recognised, the requirement for restructuring would not be achieved.
However, this option is admitted by Mexico laws.
It is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are a half of examples such as Agremex and Comercial Mexico, for which the subsidiary debts were handed by the Federal Competitive Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after the votes were revoked, the believers would stand against Vitro's company in the court of the United States, such as the "sup funds", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, have not reached.
The vote would reach approximately 45% to 37.
The Court of Auditors shall not take this information into account.
From another angle of view, the Court of Vitro is guilty of the difficulty that has occurred since 2008 - in the background of the serious economic crisis that has attacked the United States.
Meanwhile, the family company Gonzál_ Sady gives a revocation to a new review directly at the revocation court, so that the review is complete, so five judges, because they voted only three votes.
It will not succeed here, as a correct revision of the process of higher institutions, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case, it is important that the court noted the document sent by the Mexican Government as a friend of curiae, in which the procedure is detailed by Vitro in the context of the Concurrence Law and in which it indicates that the company has facilitated it by drawing up agreements signed by both countries in order to contrary the law of the United States in the law.
Furthermore, it points out that the country has subjected to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, which are the rules set out for international cases of in·cence, which ensure equality for debtors and creditors.
Return to both sides: the penalty for Vitro and State.

Dragon Mart's distress

Reyes was before in 2008, the brain murdered him on a road chair in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as player of younger categories, player of the national basketball liga BSN, owner and trainer of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in a national basketball liza, or president of the Portorial Basketball Federation.
"I stayed in my lives in basketball a lot of role, especially some at the same time, as when I was president of the National League BSN in the 90s, the General Acter of the National Team and the President of the Federation," Reyes called at the visit of the Primera Hora reporters at home in Bayamon, where he lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't move in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are at the same time all stumbled with and with the objects of his long career, prove that.
Bayamon in the heart
With the biggest movement of all guards, those who act in his action in Vaqueros for half of the 50s, where he was player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a contractor or owner of the team.
"It was my best years, that I was most enjoying because I had the opportunity with the Vaqueros team to get eight mysteries since 1967, or as owner, contractor, or trainer.
It was a number of successful years, including five championates made in the years from 1971 to 1975.
And then I spoke with a championate -- in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in the BSN.
At that time, the team took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I think Gene Bartow, who was a trainer here before and acted at the Albanian University in Birmingham, said to me, "I have a two-meter player for you.
You want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Portorica had ever had.
Bartow then recommended the player of Raymonda Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I think he said, if Mincy brings Bayamo winning in the championate, Gausse will contribute to the next."
The championate, when the Vaqueros team played Gausse, was enjoyed, but only in the remote, because in 1988 he was already executing the president of the Basketball Federation.
At that time, he wanted to work fullly with his own and enjoy Mincy's location in the national team.
"I'll see how we first struck the United States in the Olympics Battle in Mexico in 1989.
Then the world's campaign arrived in 1990, where we ended the fourth, but we had to have a bronze not to be the Canadian decision that allowed us to repeat the final income," Reyes said.
Is a man from the world's mastership in 1990 the best national team you ever saw?
It's among the best, like the one who hit Dream Team in Olympiade in 2004.
But my favorite was a national team in the Panameric games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the United States man that was quite similar to what we had a bronze to the world's mastership.
This man was not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivase, Fica Lópeze and "Piculina", but also there were young people (Javier) "Toñito" and James Carter, the brothers of León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 for the damage of the gentlemen.
A man who may not have been perfect charged, but who could win our golden medal and bring us great joy was a man from the olympic Property in 1995 in the argentin Nequen.
With players on the players, like "Canito" Neves, Pablo Alice and the youth player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players replaced for the trip in the Panama games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predicts.
What was the best player of Portorica?
It was without doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers of international tours are effective.
No one from Portorica has reached this level of outcomes like Piculin.
Don't talk about his actions in different lines where he played.
Who was the best portor trainer?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation that belonged to Julio Toro, Flor Melléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armmandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arilla from young people.
What is your success in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous ears of nationality in 1988 to 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s, BSN's national legs were in one way up to 17 men.
What did you not get to prove?
It was the things I wanted to introduce as the distribution of youth category by regions.
For example, the boys from Ponce would only play in their own areas and cooperate with teams from other corners of the island only in national play-offs.
Now children travel too much and play too many stocks, which are not necessary.
I also see the benefits in the obligation certificates and currency for trainers, decision-masters and decisions.
I'm glad.
What are you doing now?
I'm more listening to music, looking at YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoying uncle, and sometimes going to basketball stores.
And, of course, I'm enjoying my wife Isabel, who's been at my side.
He died here Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Word in Texas, worldwide examined the main role of John Rosse Ewing, known as "J.R". in the Dalas TV series, in which he endeavored to a man who acted independently and was incredible and manipulating.
Larry Hagman, whose role of J.R. Ewing's famous magnate in the TV series of Dallas became a symbol of hunger in the 80s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who was returned this year as J.R. in a new series of Dallas, died according to the official notification of the family that the agent Press offered to Dallas Warner Bros., on Wednesday afternoon on the complication associated with cancer.
"Larry returned to his loved family town Dallas, where he again played the iconic role that he had best to do," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends with him were in Dallas on the Day of Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was a representative of his wives in the pêch and new series, was with Hagman at the moment when he died in the Dutch hospital," told her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He was happy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, big, funny, nice, kind and talented, and he's going to be terriblely touched after him.
He was unique and lived his life full," said Linda Gray in an announcement.
Hagman's hepatic surgery in 1992, and he himself admitted that many years had been drinking.
In 1995, he was found a devastated hall on the heat, and Hagman was decreased by transplantation.
A year before sending a series Dallas, Hagman in television was celebrated as a genuine guy in the relief commodity I Dream of Jeannie sent by NBC station from 1965 to 1970.
Here is the game of Tony Nelson's position, astronaut, whose life will change when he meets the attractive girl (jina), playing Barbara Eden, and take her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies, which were sent only shortly, and that the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His research in films included roles that were well accepted by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was until Hangman's mastership in the appearance of an incredibly unbelievable J.R., who led him to the star top.
The dramatic series of CBS stations on Ewing's clone and other characteristics around them has been sent from April 1978 to May 1991.
"Who shot Jejar?", who had to expect the work of a full emotion when Hangman's law was almost killed, caused not only a huge number of speculators around the world but also a risk of millions of dollars in tax offices.
This work also helped to achieve a record in follow-up.
In November 1980, the response was discovered was monitored in average 41 million television divisions, and Dallas became the second most followed round of the history after the mission of the MASH series in 1983, which followed 50 million divisions.
On J.R., she shot his black Christian (they played Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. were pregnant, and then he threatened her to be a prostitute if she didn't leave the city.
Hagman played Ewing, an insensitive charismatic smiling chamtizer: a lstic businessman and an unbelieving husband who tried to make his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was alcoholic, was closed to the treatment.
"I know what I want to have J.R. on the grave stone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be there, "This is the honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing he didn't get out.
Victoria Principal, who was playing in the p-serie, remembered on Friday on Hagman as someone who was "wonderful on a plane and outside".
It is unforgettable and unreplaceable for millions of wonderful people in the world and in the hearts of all of us who had the happiness to know him and love him.
Ten parts of the new series of Dallas sent TNT station a few months ago with great success.
"The five parts of the second row have been completed and the sixth was just running," she informed the TV station.
No statements from Warner or TNT station were available after Hangman's death on how the series will continue.
The parent from Fort Wordh in Texas was a son of heric and song Mary Martin's, who played in classical works, such as the Southern Music and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she born Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
At the beginning of the 50 ’ s, Larry tried happiness on divorce scenes in New York and then served in England in 1952 to 1956 at the airport.
There he met the young Swedish sponsor Axelson, who was married.
The wife's couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a time in the California town of Malibu, where there is a lot of celebrities.
In 2001, he issued the Autobiographic Book Hello Darlin': Tall (and absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't give anything that I thought could hurt someone or hurt him," said Agent Prince Asociada.
After hepatic transplanting, he began to promote organs' gifts and worked as a volunteer in the hospital where he helped poor patients.
"I help them, add courage, meet them when they go to the operation and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the meaning, "Do not be afraid, it'll be a little unfair, but you'll be healthy."
He was also a activist in the fight against smoke and has developed different campaigns.
Starts a course that examines "the end of the world"
Each week students consider apocalyptic subjects as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When Professor of Religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would make a course on the end of the world, he thought that it was an unresolvable medication: The end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar, which was to come 21st, was captured by many people as a evidence that the end of the world is coming.
However, Charme had no idea what he expects in several months: Catastrophal Urikan Sandy, a budgetary ruin called some of the debt Armageddon, and the growing conflict in which Israel was invaded, where, according to the Christians who are theoretized on the end of the world, the Apocalypse is attracted.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most calibreous semester as ever," Charmé said to Rutgers University in Camden in New Jersey this week.
When a person decides what's going on today in the world, as if we were 30 days, it's really a good time.
And remember that bad means apocalyptic thinking good.
And it's not the only professor who offers the "the end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the latter in the season.
At the University of Temple, a professional assistant Barry Vacker's course "Culture, and the end of the world".
Each week students consider apocalyptic subjects as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We're looking for why these thoughts are spread with time," he says, "and how hypothetic scenarios are offered to run certain human behaviors.
For example, the nuclear material is getting into the hands of terrorists, it can explode war.
This month students analysis films with apocalyptic topics and find out how different it is from examples of real life.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probably, reliable and impossible," says Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University in Pennsylvania, the Latin American History Professor Matthew Reë and his colleague Amara Solariova, a professional assistant of the history of art and antropology to organize a course with the simple name The End of the world.
"We don't join "2012", because we count it with the possibility of reorganizing the course in the case that the world will not end," said Re.
Even through "terrible destruction" students have to study, create projects and make final tests.
The Penn State will be a final trial to do before the Apocalypse evening, which does not give students a chance other than to work "to the evening of the expected end of the world," said Rea.
The courses became pretty harmful.
"It went around in two hours," said Ray about his course for students with a high prospect, which was notified 35.
Weights and weeks before the start of the semester, we got the e-mail question if it's still a place.
Only students assure that the course is one of the most interesting ones.
"I'm going to be fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Rutgers University at Camden, 23-year Bridgid Robinson, a student of religious defense and sociology from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
So apocalyptic, worldly or religious thinking is only a question of comfort or absent.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student of psychology and treatment, said he had seen all apocalyptic films.
"I never heard of the hour in which it could be learned," he said.
"I'm using it."
But none of the students, then the professor, said that they were not at the date of the end of 21st.
"Our first project was negotiated about the Maastricht's prediction and we're just going to release it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last year at the Temple University of West Chester.
"May's never announced the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," said Ree.
But he added that in the west culture there is an apocalyptic uz, which is a few centuries back, which people react to the changes in their environment by the predicts of the end of the world.
The flower of these speculations caused the Internet.
"Nothing else people don't think about it," said he.
That's what's happening in totally English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religious religion at the University of La Salle, who has been transferring this year at the Philippines, asked if he knows about the "the end of the world" course.
"The Philippines are not participating at the end of the world," he wrote and indicated an exception at the Highest Authority.
We have mercy from Papa.
Re ́ noted that during the years there were many days of the last court, and he said that if nothing happens 21st, "the people will immediately think about the next date" or philosopher that 21th is the beginning of the seventh period in which the world will end.
Date takes the easily weight of students and professors.
A few of them said he wanted to go to the "the end of the world" festival.
"I'll call a few friends, and they laughed together," explained the 20-year Samir Ford communication student.
