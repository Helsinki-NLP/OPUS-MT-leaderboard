Obama received Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and the destabilising measures of Teheran in the Near East.
In the meeting, however, the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution should also be addressed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stressed for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s enduring sedimental building and suggests that Netanyahu is missing wills in the peace process.
By the Deal of Obama on the Iranian Atomic Programme, the relationship of the two has continued to be deteriorated.
In March, Netanyahu had held a conflicted speech on the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, which was, in part, evaluated as an opposite against Obama.
The talk was not discussed with Obama, a meeting had refused to take note of the election in Israel.
In a call, Professor has shot his girlfriend
In a call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a little tired voice that he had shot his friend and that the officers had to come home.
Lamb was important to show that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably surprised, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found the body of Amy Printiss and a hand-written note that was criticized on a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted to turn it back, I loved Amy and she was the only woman who loved me." This was, according to the information of the authorities in the letter, and he was understood by Lamb.
There was no note that Lamb, who in two online courses for the Delta State in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the schoolman, where he had shot and killed a popular historical professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to the office.
Delta State ́ Police Boss Lynn Buford said that university workers have heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb's made the deceitful call after it.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life when the police insulted him.
One day after the shooting at the University, students and Doen forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to make a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the mediators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him helped to make a picture of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher.
Students said they were glad for his teaching.
The police in G.G.er, where Prentiss died, said he had no story of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had taught the Lamb in a book written by him, in which he learned the "wonderful men" with which he shared his academic life.
Both were informed in the Department for Social Sciences and History, including 17 members of their teacher, and many students visited courses of both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations to problems.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to do stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously requested the Delta State for a authorisation for health reasons and said that he had some health problems.
In this year, he only trained two online courses.
The latest changes in the employment policy of the University indicated that the promotion, which had so hard for the Lamb, would not be guaranteed for him for a automatic way to establish as assistant professor.
President of University William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that the Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the flight from the campus, the police found Lamb's track later when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, the lamb killed himself with a .38 Kaliber gun in the backhouse of a house, about a mile south of his parents' house at the border of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running into the entrance.
It wasn't soon clear why the Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started in 2009 his work at the University, which has 3.500 students in a city with approximately 12.000 inhabitants and taught geographic and padagogic.
He promoted in Padagogic in the early year.
One of the long-term friends of the Lambs took him as intelligent, charistic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when she met by common friends.
She and her friends were at high school, and he was the cool old man who tried to teach her the gitarr game for a few years.
He was the woman's warm at that time.
All girls shoot there when he was there," Hairston said, now 40 and in the Jackson President of Brandon.
Lamb and printiss were obviously a few times together.
In the call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no urkunde from a wedding.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the backsteen house, which limited to a Bayou in Gâer.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Printiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they were married 15 years ago, but friends remained and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally severe on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
You and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that the Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Printiss when he and Abigail occurred three years ago on a summer-year.
Later, they played together one or another Gig.
O'Steen said his daughter is writing and sing her own music.
Printiss was a nurse who was online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes a funeral coordinator at the Julep Room, a weak lighted bar near G.A., said that he saw Lamb and Printiss Night on the night 5 September the last time after the lamb ended his gitarr and mouth harmony game before a sphere public.
There were no signs that something was wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We were at the cleaning, and we broke together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of divorce.
Schmidt, the dead Professor, guided the first seminar programme and specialised to ananian urinary and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a English Professor at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the Committee of Students.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people participated in a Memorial of Christmas on Wednesday evening on the Delta State Campus.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mainwache, while the University School "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The education will be re-inserted on midnight.
"We are trying to move our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of health.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police said now that Lamb had made the call after he had shoot Schmidt, and that Lamb in-called Printiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two had ever married.
Toys R Us plant to set less work forces for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas workers as the last year, but the player and baby product trader says that he will give the current workers and season workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it was planning to set up 40,000 people in lands and markets throughout the country. On Wednesday 2014, 45,000 employees were established.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that it would begin with applications in this month and increase the number of employees from October to December.
Since the feasts are removed for months, Christmas work is closer, and enterprises are prepared to set up timeworkers to equip lands with employees who are spending, sending, and delivering products.
Michael J. Fox broke over his "date" with Princess Diana
The first of "Back to the Future" was probably a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also valuable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat is empty near me, and it will be clear to me that Princess Diana will sit near me," he said in a trailer for a future documentary film "Back in Time".
The movie begins, and it comes to me that I am a simulated girdle and a armed length from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with Regisseur Robert Zemeckis and the product Steven gameberg.
"Back for the Future" had first 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Playberg, "inconsistently the greatest time travel movie that has ever been rotated."
"Back in Time" will be viewed on VOD, DVD and in selected cines in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in
General Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's strengthened military support is: "There is no military solution" of almost five years of conflict, and more weapons will only be worse for millions of people.
The UN Chief again calls on all parties, the United Nations Shared Security Council, to join and integrate negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban, a press conference at the middle-week, said that he was planning to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the meeting of the General Assembly still in this month to discuss the situation.
He deceived that in the Council and within the Syrian people and the Regional Powers "insolve this situation".
Ban urged the five persistent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity when the crisis was invading in the crisis, which they had demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Interview values showing that Donald Trump is to take seriously.
Some have tried to mark him as a flop.
Others dropped him as a shit.
And some are waiting for a break.
But whatever some Republicians are trying to move Donald Trump from the top rings in questioning, it has not worked (not yet).
Ten of the last 11 national investigations showed that Donald Trump leads in the two-fold area, and some begin to ask themselves seriously what it means for the opportunities of nomination of the Immobility Module.
Of course it's too early in the election period.
Nobody claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts indicate that at this time, Rick Perrys Führer was delivered to the growing Herman Cain, from which no one won only one State in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general choice.
But foreign groups such as Jeb Bushs Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps' maintenance powers and begin to leave their floors to break it.
Here are some current inquiry values that indicate that the real estate is not only a transient phase:
Trumps' values of values have rotated 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in the middle of June, a survey from Monmouth University showed that only two of the Republicans saw the Immobilious Module positive.
Until mid July there were 40 Pro.
The beginning of August was 52 Pro.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Approximately three of them say that they have a negative view.
And these numbers are held in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa has found last week that 60 Pro of the Republicans have a view of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP electors GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week, 67 pro of the Republicans said that they would either be "inspired" or "rejoiced" if Trump was nominated.
Only two of 10 say they'd be "injured" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson is able to make the same comfort as Trump (43 Pro said they would be "inspired" vs. 40 Pro, who say the same about Trump).
Next in things of disturbance?
Marco Rubio with only 21 Pro.
On the other hand, 47 Pro of the Republican electors say that they would be "insatisfied" or "injured" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
Most of the Republicans don't see Trumps Temperament as a problem.
Wonderful Donald Trump is criticised for his bombastic and prosperous statements, 52 pro of the Irish electors tending to the Republicans believe that the Immobilious Mogule has the right temperature for a president, so ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-elected state of the nation, the Federal State Iowa, where the same 52% of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a super-commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 Pro seems that he does not have the personality to perform his office effectively, and almost six of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit in the white house, so ABC/Post.
Republican electors are used to the idea.
When they set their teachers, the Republican electors hold Trump real.
When they are asked who wins the GOP nomination first, they say after a survey of CNN/ORC from last week four of that Trump is the best weight.
This is a exchange since the time when four of the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete revelation: GOP electors had not in the past the clearest cristal ball.
At that time in the last cycle, four of the Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination for only 28% for the final candidate in the middle of Romeney.
However, a number of GOP electors of Trumps' campaign is viewed as plain.
Even if the Republicans gather themselves for another candidate, Trump is almost one.
Some experts indicate that the split field probably contributes to Trumps' leads while the anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a decade of other candidates.
But a survey of Monmouth University beginning September shows that in a hypothetical head-and-heading run between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is supporting the majority.
He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and s日 before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-in-head run with Ted·z.
The only candidate who kills him?
Ben Carson would overcome the undertaking with 19 points in a hypothethical head-in-head run.
A nice majority of Donald-Trump Fans says they have developed their opinion.
A new question of CBS/NYT on Wednesday shows that only a little more than the half of the electors who submit Trump say that they have forgiven their voices firmly.
Of course, many can happen to change this, and no one can really say to never change the opinion.
46 Pro said they left the door open to change to other candidates.
However, Trumps are the strongest competition at the moment of the other foreign, the neurochirurg Ben Carson, but electors who say they have made their opinion are so frequently for Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration theme.
Since Donald Trump in his election campaign two months ago called immigrants from Mexico, the immigration in the public talk was in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombing expression of Trump will be kept away from the Republican Party and protect the efforts to reorientate.
But after the new ABC/Post Question from Monday, six of the 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as the immigration remains in the ramp light, it will seem to do Donald Trump too.
The frustration of the Government is a new maximum level.
In the meantime, on Donald Trump and Ben Carson, half the support of the Republican electors, especially through their external status.
In the new Monday Question of ABC/Post, six of the 10 Republicans say that they prefer a political foreigner than someone who has a government.
And they're also worn at Washington.
A survey from Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa shows that three of the four Iowa Republicans have been frustrated over the Republicans in the Congress, with 54 Pro "unsatisfied" and 21 Pro "heavened".
München, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residents of Germany
Here, in the Hobookenway, is the bigest habitation - with a corner over the North Sea Black.
In the street, a square meter of a reetdach house costs in the range of EUR.300.
"The boat of objects is naturally limited on the sylt," it says in the area - so the high price.
A new area shows in which special layer a square meter costs most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square meter for a student's bud in monkeys are not really small.
In contrast to Germany's top hometowns, however, one of the prices is like Peanuts.
The real estate service officer angels & peoples has published a list of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meters prices in swimming heights.
There are no more than ten thousand euros - per square meter, well, noticed.
But well, who can do it...
Moreover: Mountains are not here except at the top.
Champions League: Bayern-Traumstart thanks Mâcher and gods
Two-fold ports in Pireo: Bayern-Star Thomas Mämer has just a run.
A happy meeting of Thomas Mâer ejected the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Pireus - then we walked.
A sovereign record of the Champions League season.
The World Master Thomas Mıer and Mario Godze protected the FC Bayern in the Hexenkessel of Piräus a dream start in the "Mision Mailand".
The manship of Trapér Pep Guardiola wins her intake game in the Champions League at the Greek recorder Olympiakos in heavy atmosphere thanks to Mhâlers Doublepack (52./90.+2) and God's match (89.) deserves 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth starting success in series will be the first step to end on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola wants to finally get the hankelpot to München.
Mücher received a favorable support in the Champions League to the Bayern Voyage of Olympias tower Roberto, who made a shot of the worldmaster as a flage thought.
"We won't subestimate them," said the Bayern Captain Philipp Lahm before the game in Karaiskakis station before 31.688 heat-blowing fans - and the Münchners kept the word.
They showed a convergenced and engaged idea without bleeding.
Pirous had won his latest six home games in the King class, including against hostile clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund was also murdered here (1:3).
However, the Bayerns, in seven Europeancup duals with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They went courageously in their open effort, but often too unfortunately to work.
The attacks were too often started by game inflation. On the left side of Douglas Costa, who rarely passed against the former Braunchweek Omar Elabdellaoui.
Mâer had more happiness from right than his flaw from the right half field in the top left tower.
In the 67th minute, the world master forgave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in help one had Robert Lewandowski.
Tone, as the Olympiacos-sturm Ideye Brown struck the Poland's headball from the line (26).
Then by direct exception, the Torwart Roberto compared with the knee (35).
Although the Bayer's habitual dominant game on ., Pirates could put the needle steel.
On the gateway Manuel Newer, however, it was abandoned.
So sometimes when he shot a shot of Idey over the latte (56).
Before Newer, Guardiola made a fourth chain with David Alaba in the center near Jerome Boateng, which made it well.
Mario Godze, after muscular problems back in the frame, sat outside.
The WM hall gave green light only after the final training, Matthias sports representation said at "Sky": "Whoever wants to do something else of it, it's already bad."
Even during the first shift, Guardiola disappeared against him when he Kingsley Coman for the attacked Lewandowski (59).
Gods came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made it clear 13 minutes later, Mâer put on another.
Before the game, it was arrived at the stadium to crawls.
After a smaller group of parts convinced Bayern-Fans in their viewer-block, apparently the attachments of hosts Pirates with words and gestures provoked, the security forces entered and came with shocks against the Münchner Attachers.
At least a Bayern-Fan was injured from the stadium.
Who smokes has a risk to lose teeth
Who smokes, not only damage the long, but also the teeth - that puts a long-term study near.
The message: In delay, the risk is quick.
The smokers have a clearly increased risk to lose their teeth early.
This is based on the long-term study of a international research team, including several workers of the German Institute for Ennue Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
In comparison with non-rookers, the risk of losing their teeth was in the case of smokers to lose their teeth in the case of 2.5 to 3.6 feet.
The farmers had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes for dental accidents are the carries and inflammations of the dental meat, stressed by the DIFE.
For this parodontity, smoking is a risk factor, the authors are pointing out.
Therefore, the relationship between smoking and dental loss returns to more frequent teeth infections in fumers.
It is not clear how smoking can also increase the risk of carries.
People who stopped smoking could, however, reduce their risk within a short time, write the researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it may dure over years until the risk falls again to the level of non-rookers, Thomas Dietrich explained first from the English University of Birmingham.
People must be convinced that they are not smoking, the leader Heiner Boeing stated by the DIFE: "Rows reduce lifetime."
Don't smoke is good for longs and vessels and leads to a good teeth health to high age, according to our knowledge.
In Germany, more than 20% of the population are affected by dentistlessness between 65 and 74 years, the DIFE shared.
Previous studies had already indicated that smoke increases the risk of early dental accidents.
The new long-term study undermines the findings.
Archaeologists stood on Kölner Rheinfer on residues from the late antiquity
For a repeated time, archaeological funds have been made on the right round in Köln.
Near the building site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum have buried Skelette and the rest of historical buildings, said the Museum of Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the building work at Rhein, historians have been searching for so-called landscapes.
At all buildings in the city of Köln, the museum will always be added as a fashion for architecological landscapes.
In the building section of the Rheinboulevard, the architects are now found.
From text documents, it was already known that in the fourth century a firm and in the 8th century a church has stated three.
Besides the Festival and the Church Tower, a Friedhof was also discovered with approximately 350 tombs, which would be part of the church.
Young Women of goods
After a young woman at the trainhof in Geilenkirchen-linders has been lucky, the Federal Police asks the population to help.
On the early midnight morning at 1.40 a.m., the woman from the direction of the bathroom, coming to the end of the road, passed the glass and was captured by a bond that came from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
It has made the most serious damage to the Federal Police.
It was notedly treated at the place and brought by salvation forces into a hospital.
On the basis of the nightly transmission of the young woman's bridge, the expert officers do not have any knowledge.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or have experienced acustic observations.
Question comes to residents or passengers of Linderner Travel, Castle Road, Thomas Hofstraße and Leiffarther Street (L364).
The indications of the cause of the accident may be given to the phone 0800/6888000 or to any other police offices around the hotline of the Federal Police.
The EU Commission proposes a new court against TTIP
The EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current court system.
Conflicted private clarification facilities for conflicts between concerts and States should therefore be resolved by a more transparent system that is clearly more traditional in its functional manner.
"We want to establish a system that the citizens trust," stated the Commissioner of the EU, Cecilia Malmström, at the point of view.
Sweden intends to introduce the proposal as a negotiating position in the free trade discussions with the United States.
The German government announced support.
Through TTIP, the world's largest free trade zone will be with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current procedures provide specifically that the EU States and the United States choose together independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to be parts of the EU, the United States and third countries.
For the first time, it is also expected to be a second instance.
It would allow it to make a claim against judges.
In the meantime, the proceedings involved were agreed on judges, and there was no opportunity to make a decision against their sentences.
In the debate of the past months, citizens have not trusted the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
It will, according to its own information, work at a international investment court.
For example, there could be conflicts between Chinese companies and EU countries.
The procedures for investor State disputes (ISDS) which are particularly required by large groups are considered as one of the main foundations for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional courts are criticized by enemies as a kind of parallel light, to extent injury to tax payers, to decrease national laws or to decrease consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact were insufficient to the proposals of the EU Commission.
In particular, it was criticized that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
However, the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) covered the plans as a major progress.
The Commission takes into consideration the essential points in the reform which the Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel has taken in the early year with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private courts is from the table.
The French Government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The Business Europe's company association warned that the economy's opportunities would be incurred by too many new rules.
It was said that small and medium-sized enterprises could be decreased by this.
When the discussions on the Free Trade Agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be concluded, it continued to be unexpected at midweek.
The negotiations are running since the middle of 2013.
However, the theme of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States.
Initially, a framework for the Agreement should already be the end of this year.
This date shall apply as not longer.
Delicate people of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago, Sufjan Stevens is sitting on the stairs in the Kölner Prime Club (this day: Luxor).
Besides him, a flipchart, on which the shifting people's songs opened the American Malerian state Michigan with figs.
The whole public, approximately 40 persons, is almost taken by Stevens proposal.
He speaks on the basis of various places that he always holds on the map, reports about his minucy and kind of arranged songs.
Where they are raised and how it looks there, in his home.
From now on, Stevens is shown as a wonderful creative error.
By 2003, "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" appears intelligently composed of Li's composite, which can sharing harmoniously very closely to an'an'an'anan people of the late sixty, but at any time in great opulent operations.
It is the fact that "Michigan" would be the first part of a moved series: each of the 50 U.S. States should be followed.
However, since 2004 and in Rheinähe, "Seven Swans" has already occurred and has a positive number of expectations.
Reduced Stevens is here.
Live's enough guitars and Banjo.
A year later, the musician who lives in New York returns to the series.
In 2005, "Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") appears a farming work.
Overborderly to ideas and stylistic finesses.
The album grows in the Billboard Charts and does not miss any yearly list of influenced music media.
After overproductive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very large electronic transmissions.
This sixth regular album is still widely orchestrated, but it plays by programmed sequences or beats, and plays with all effects and Halls.
As long as the smaller clubs are reached, the bounce shows here will be a bunch of species from Neon starbands and a great fluorescent bounding endeco.
Currently Sufjan Stevens turns as part of a five-copper band through Germany.
Hamburger's more in darkness!
Theater presents mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although here are now nearly 2000 guests built in their chairs, the clearly rich Stevens return to the intimity and to the people.
Without addressing a word to the public, the group of excellent musicians plays the widely available album.
You can hear from the public: the statement is "opulent" and so you can remove the "places in the ground".
First, Stevens is grateful to be humble, appealing a few older songs and declining himself under a sending applause.
Jeremy Corbyns Debout at the Premier Minister's question time
Since he has chosen, Mr Corbyns Debout is expected at the question of the Prime Minister's question.
The new laboratory president Jeremy Corbyn will give his debt at the question of the Prime Minister's question and take place with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will be raised to put the first questions of his six questions shortly after midnight, whereas its performance of the media is likely to be examined and the laboratory members will be examined nearly.
He requested "mince theater and more" in this weekly event.
He also said that he could overcome some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership because it comes after his appointment to the member of the shadow cabinet and after his talk on the TUC Year Agency on Thursday.
In the meantime, the decision of the president of the Labor, on Sunday during the singing of the National Hymne at a Memorial celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence, has caused criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is in the middle of several title pages stories in the magazines.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymne has taken attention to itself.
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn said he would have "stood in respectful silence" and he recognized the "Herdentum of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle for England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyns' shadow cabinet, Owen, told in the BBC Two Newsnight program, he told the president of the Labor to sing the national hymne, "independent" of the faith that the monarchie should be canceled.
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns Spitmanship, and they call on differences in the economic, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him as leader originally.
The political representative of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stapeled" within the laboratory, even after Mr. Corbyn's comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winning.
Mr. Corbyn said to the TUC conference that Labour had made changes to remove the entire idea of a total limitation.
Hours later Mr. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth laboratory president, David Cameron, since he is Tory Chief, standing against the box of dispatch in Parliament last year.
The laboratory president, who has promised another approach, says that he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
Islington North MP said that the question time of the Prime Minister is too controversy, and that it will be laid down both "scrollability" and the fight against the opposite, and it has proposed to address serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of the Economic Minister, will represent him if he does not share - for example, when Mr Cameron is in the foreign country.
He also made the idea that other colleagues sometimes accept the word and that he invited John Bercow, the speaker of the sub-house, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from the style of a "Casperle Theater" that was often linked to the question time of the Prime Minister, but some years later he agreed that he had denied it.
Since she was first sent in the television in 1990, the question time with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leader in the sub-house and his position under his colleagues, although criticians argued that she had become a career and needed a large reform.

Pound increased by accelerated payment growth in the United Kingdom
The pound increased rapidly to data showing a growth in the United Kingdom's wage growth, and in parallel FTSE 100 was increased by the command target SAB Miller.
Between May and July, the result without Boni in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9% to the same previous year.
Since 2009, this progress rate was the fastest and resulted estimates on the date of an increasing ratio.
The pound increased more than 1 % to $1.5505 and was estimated up to 0.84 % to EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index increased by 1.49% to 6.229,21.
SAB Miller was the excellent action on the market and made a salt of 20 % after receipt of the Rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breasts of the world and bring marks such as Buddhist, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry action was 0.9% of the competition concern for Luxury Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales numbers struggle all expectations and also showed that the turnover in China - a key for Burberry - has been indicated growth again.
Actions of Glencore increased by 5% after the Bergbaurian said he had taken $2,5 billion by an asset refund as part of his debt debt.
The actions of the Package and Paper Concern Mondi were the largest losers on the index, and with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had set its estimation for the company Rating on "forward".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing undertakings had reported a 46.6 million pre-tax results for the half year.
The leader of JD Sports says that the payments are the expansion.
The business manager of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the potential customers' bags".
But it is unlikely that this purchase power will compensate the work in his company, he says.
The costs could take the expansion plans of JD sports, if it added, and that could mean there is less extra jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
21-year-old lapse, a boy with high-shirt fresh.
The guy with the platin blonde hair is 100 million euros hard.
Before even more.
Mr Bieber is now in Berlin.
And the generation U17 turns through.
Like Victoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of Fans joined Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 hours in the morning, however, the polyne has been sitting on the cold stone plates of Berlin Luxus hotel at the potsdamer place.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live an Idol, whose poster is locked up in Stettin since Montagued.
The suite in which the Canadian song lives costs exactly the day as their mom Ewa deserves in half year.
If it's all.
She says, "My Wiktoria should actually sit in the Gymnasium class."
"I'll inherit her a dream."
School obligation?
Who's gonna like it?
The fans don't.
Neither Bieber himself.
He's been out there.
For the advertising in the public pause of the Superbo, he kasted three million, a two-year deal with an anti-Pickel company, many, many on Bieber account.
And at every puppe that looks like him and goes over the ladentic, the bieber also kasses.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're on the window ship.
More than 100 million he'd have used this way.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others stress that Bieber is just in the United States and the United Kingdom with his new single "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, are not interested in many zeroes first.
At least he's doing that.
Pegida Plakat brings Libanon to Cartofel Islands Idees
Cards or damn?
It is both - and in the Cartoffield Country, developed by the Oldenburg Imbis owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the language "Kartoffel puesto Döner" on a Placate of Pegida movement Alhay cartoffel and meat together on a shot.
On the idea, a place was on him at a Pegida demonstration with the title "Cartoffels place Döner", which he had seen accidentally in television.
Since then, a grill bowl has been driven with meat and cartoffles.
"This is multiculti for the magic," Alhay says.
The idea has made the Libanese a place between the Patent Tax in München.
There it has been formed as a pattern of use, according to the information of the Authority.
How much meat and how many cartons of the shoes contain, Alhay will not deliver.
Just so much: "It's smiling together even better," he finds.
Also, his customers have the culinary consensus of the people.
Metcash starts earthquake campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash tries to shalt the IGA branches before a Aldi-Aufmarch in Southern and Westersea.
Food storer Metcash has started a farming campaign to defend the market share of IGA soldiers in Southa and Westersea in the prevalence of $700 million Aldi invasion.
Wonderful Aldi prepared the exhibition of two transactions and the first 120 countries in Southa and Western in the beginning of the next year, strengthening the Metcash and IGA supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA mark through stream marketing and conversion over the social media, as well as through events as the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers run on board, with marks such as eish manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, distributing samples in IGA lands, and accommodating the customers of the customers of the Southern Football tickets to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash publishs further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the main trader for food, alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day.
It is a lot on the game since Southa and Western have almost 30 Pro > of Metcash IGA loading businesses and generate profit margins as Metcashs IGA network in the East States.
Buyers in Southa and Westersea are nottoric provincies and IGA soldiers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 Pro in South日a and 24 Pro日 in Westerna compared to about 14 Pro in East States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will be removed for 12 months after the expiration of its first markets about five pro of the food in these two countries and will remove sales from all existing actors, but mainly self-handlers.
According to a report published in this week, the analogue Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley assessed that IGA soldiers could lose $360 million per year and Metcash $250 million until the end of 2016.
This predict is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 years in the SA and 30 in WA in the next year and get a total of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the neighborhood and food and in the amounts of metcashs high fixed base, Metcash could cost about 13 million dollars from prices and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash lost market shares in the East States, mainly in Aldi and Coles, though a recently conducted investigation from Roy Morgan found that IGA purchasers were the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's turnover in the neighbourhood and food business will fall by 3,8 Pro in 2016, by 4,1 Pro in 2017 and by 2,1 Pro in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 Pro in 2015 to 10,3 Pro ° to 2020.
Last week the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told at a business seat in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a year.
Metcash refused to react publicly to Mr Douglass's comments.
But it will be concluded that a member of Methcash has contacted Mr Douglas last week.
The IGA market share has been decreased since 2010 by 18 Pro to 14 Pro, and income from Metcashs Nah Nah Trade and Food Trade, which provides approximately 100 IGA soldiers, has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, which reflects the operational debt debt in the simultaneous pressure on transmission and margins.
However, the large marketer turns up and invests more than 150 million dollars to improve the sales prices with Coles and Wool in hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA-shops in the improvement of their lands through faster growing fresh food and to provide a better choice of private-label lives.
Metcash's main business leader Ian Morrice says that price adjustments and load-shaning programmes will be added to Elan and hopes that the large-shoper in 2017 will return to a winning growth for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kirgis and deserved the president of the Australian Tennis Federal Steve Healy more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, which is always being "special Ks" again, is conducted by the motivated exhibition of Kirgisi with Stan Wawricka at the Montreal Masters in the light of the ramp.
In a firely qualification game in Ci ́innati, soon after that, Cokkinakis and his adversary Ryan Harrison had to be driven twice by the judge, and Harrison said, "Wawrinka had to kill Kirgisi, and I should slay the child."
When he was recently seen as he struck a tennis shop, after a cramp made a potential US-open sequence by Richard Gasquet, Cokkinakis was permanently defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth, around the second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup Halbfinal against British.
"And one thing I'm very exciting about is the fact that Thanasi, I think, has been a little in the fight," Healy said.
He broken a killer when he lost a cramp in the US open, but he is not the first player who has broken a square of fruit with himself, and I know Thanasi enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, actually, he has been very good in the US opens, even under the very provocating circumstances with Harrison and so further, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was too strictly treated.
He is a very rigorous 19-year-old man, he is very hard, and he fits in the team and thus he has never had a problem with the other players, he will be respected in the environment, he is trained hard, he is well in form, he is a very stable and exhausted young man, and I think he deserves to be evaluated according to his own deserves.
Healy also supported the decision to avoid taking into account the important decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right thing for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term firm component to the team."
"Not first we want the team to be completely competited and not all the conflicts around [Kirgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick has made the growth very quickly, on people like Federer and Murray. He is growing in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad errors and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to understood him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Sometimes outside the light that he can only think of it, I think it's appropriate, and it's best for the man and it's the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary states deficiency, closes the border, retains refugees
Hungary explains the difficulty and delays the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come to the country illegally, with the aim of stoping the stream of migrants.
Chaos followed the border, when hundreds of migrants were gathered in nowhere and serb officers responded with empathy.
The people who were defeated before violence stood for an unknown time in a street on the street between the two control points of the countries and built cells and left down there.
But Frustr increased.
When a police writer switched over them, the migrants scandled "Open the border" and cried for advice against the Hungarian Preparation Police.
Show some from the Protest Food and Water back.
Serbian Foreign Minister explained that it was "inacceptable" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
It must be located in the coming days with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Turbulences at the Hungarian-Serbian border were not able to agree with a common immigration policy one day after the 28th block at a fighting meeting in Brussels.
However, the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overcoming Italy and Greece, and they hoped that the next month or until the end of the year would reach an agreement that the EU States would take another 120,000 refugees, including some of Hungary.
Angela Merkel and Austria invited the European Union to discuss the continent's immigration crisis on Saturday.
Hungary, however, did not put his hopes on a quick action of Brusel or his neighbors.
The need in two southern regions was called on Wednesday, and the authorities had more powers to control the crisis so that they could dislock roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Ssiejarto said that his country also plans the building of a stakeholder stakeholder at its border to Romania to stop migrants' accommodation through the country - after it has ended a pitch at the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison assessments were used in the course of the creation of the stakeholder's zone between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past months, Hungary has expelled many war refugees and has become a significant pass on the nearest east and a point of entry into the European Union.
President Viktor Orban, however, pointed out that most economic refugees who are on the search for a better life and not war refugees who have a protection claim - are a view that is strongly opposed to other EU States, including Germany.
The new laws that entered Middle-Thursday in Hungary make the oversight of the border or damage of the 4-metres (13 feet) high-swerf, which the Government has built over the southern border to Serbia, make a crime. These laws also establish prison penalties for condemned people.
"Furthermore, because of the situation that has occurred by the mass migration, the Hungarian Government explains the need," Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the South town Szeged said Governing Talk.
We say it very clearly: illegal transition is a crime.
The European Parliament must continue to agree with the use of the military, which is expected for the next week, but reporters of press have seen hardly armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for a day.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security adviser for Orban, said that the authorities were 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others were already deeper in the country.
They are going over by providing the defense, they are now in the police and are accused of committing crimes in accordance with the new laws.
The authorities are in order to quickly repair the tissue.
Hungarian officers also arrived on Wednesday morning two of the seven borders with Serbia, after a train carrier with stacked race to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border transition near Roschke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and to make a quantity of humans into it.
About 20 came into, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important vehicle connection of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse Nak and water until they could enter Hungary.
Wahl-2016: Hillary Clintons Vorsp before Bernie Sanders in national investigation
The former U.S. foreign minister Hillary Clinton continues to keep a two-fold predict in the democratic running on national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins you at the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47% of the democratic electors in the prevalences (58% earlier), while Sanders are at the second place, with 27 Pro® (increasing by 17 Pro).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is candidate to the Chairman's office, is supported by 15 pro­pro­jects of the democratic electors of the elections.
More than five months before the beginning of the elections, most democratic electors say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates they will be subjected.
But Clinton's subconsistents are in their choice more consistent than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News Question, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained some wins.
Clinton holds a great prespect for women and moderates, but these prejudices have been decreased.
Your support for men is clearly disappointed, and Sanders is here with only 5 points.
Clinton's benefit in democracy electors under 50 years has been defeated, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
However, Clinton has a big advantage of the elderly electors.
Last month, Clinton was before Sanders with double advantage in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point forward at this group.
Approximately the help of the democratic electors of the pre- choice worldwide said that they would have been understood by Clinton, if they were nominated by the party.
One quarter would underhold them with some preservations and another 15% would only be subjected because it is the candidate.
Six Pro would not be understood.
Maybe not surprisingly that Clinton's current subcontracters are especially disappointed by her.
The views are more mixed in those who are not currently under Clinton - only a quarter would be pleased to submit it.
48 Pro ́ of the democratic electors of the elections say that they are understood by Clinton with a pleasure, less Republican electors say this about their candidates Donald Trump (35 Pro®).
If Clinton's sub-sequences are asked in an open question why they want to be the candidate, it is the most common answer that she has the right experience (16 Pro), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become a president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 Pro).
Clinton's subservient is also trained to connect Bill Clinton (9 Pro).
Accommodation to address problems and optionality is also quoted.
Since the Vice-President puts a potential for the president's office in the Waagshall, 57 per cent of the democratic electors of the pre-electors would like to see him in the run - though a third believes that he should not do it.
When democracy electors are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
From Clinton's engagings say more than the help that Biden would be their second choice far before sanders.
If Biden decides not to candidate for the nomination of democrates, Hillary Clinton's prespeaking stands before Sanders, from 20 points with bides on 30 points without it running.
Fifty-five Pro of the Democratic electors see Clinton as candidate with the best opportunities to win the election, but this number of 78 Pro has been reduced in the last month.
Biden is a second at this measurement, but the prosecution set that seems to be the most "electable".
However, in the question of what is more important for a candidate, the democratic electors call questions on electionality.
Similarly, as in the last month, no one of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates has been shown inacceptable for these electors.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates shall produce results in some important characteristics in the electors of their party's prevalence.
Most people view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and with strong quality of conduct.
Biden is the best of the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty Pro of the Democratic electors do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, doublely so many say that about sanders (15 Pro), but 27 Pro do not think of him.
The democratic electors of the prevalence generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideally in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about one quarter of the democratic electors has no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions on Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are continued during the office as an external minister, most democratic electors are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions at all.
But it is another story in the public.
The help of the Americans is now incompatible with their appreciation, while only a third is satisfied.
The public opinion to this was divided on March soon after the problem came into light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controllers had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 Pro said that their opinion had yet been worse from her.
They are mostly Republicians, more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by the electors of her party, this is still a problem for them in total: only 32 Pro seem to be honest and trustworthy, eight Pro less than the last month and 15 points less since May.
62 Pro of the electoral rights they don't think to be a honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55% of the electoral in the country view Trump as not honest and trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump receive notes in conduct.
From the six tested candidates, the biden, Carson and Bush are best cut off in honestity.
Most of the sanders look more than honestly, but as in Carson, many don't think of him.
The error rate for the test of 351 democratic electors in the prevalence is 6 proposition points.
Ben Carson takes place at a country-wide investigation near Donald Trump on
Ben Carson is at the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times next to Donald Trump
The two candidates are among the helps of the electors' support in the new investigation, and others are dramatically lost
Republican electors continued to Trump in large numbers throughout the country, which supports 23% in the last CBS investigation, which was carried out before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Question of Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% during the same period.
The investigation also concluded that Carson is good at the demographic groups and that Trump is overcome among the Republican electors with higher education.
The field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been broken with Wisconsins Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, and is now 2% of 10% of support in the last month.
The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are 6% at the place.
The error margin in the sample of 376 people of Republican electors in this latest investigation is Plus or Minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC research that was published last week shows that Carson is growing in the investigations - he lands at 19% support for the Republicans behind the Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a carson rising up in the last week, Trump found some pages for the former neurochirurg, even after Carson apologize to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign meeting in Iowa.
Take bathroom temperatures: The Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees heat.
Even if the top values are only in the remote areas, there is a trip to the Mediterranean to find still warm water.
A bathroom in North or East Sea may be a shorter enjoyment at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some don't go to the sea anymore: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and East Sea in this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) shares.
However, bathroom temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adria, there are 25 degrees in the top, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College-Neulings
Almost two years after a student died during a schikanous ritual of a student's connection in Pocon Mountains, Pennsylvania, are put in murder against five persons.
The members of the New Yorker Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brothership attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which has been dead, shared the police.
Officers said that he was charged with a 30-pound-ruck-sack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while he tried to go through a roaring field to a target.
Mr. Deng complained about head pain, then he was unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi brotherhood did not call the 911 need number after Deng was born and expected a hour before they had him in a hospital, like the police.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothing, go up his symptoms, and Andy Meng to contact the national president of the brotherhood to take advice, the police officer Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"In this point, the members began to hide outensiles and put the brotherhood primarily on that by Michael Deng," said police officer Wagner.
He couldn't be repeated, and he died next morning on his hurt.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeated with more powerful injuries to heads, rubbers and surroundings.
"Too many families have been severed by the Schies of the brotherhood. At least a student stirs at the Sch ́en since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a legal lawyer who represents Deng's family, in a claim.
Brotherships and their members must be taken into account, and this step of the authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a complaint for murder degrees for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the brotherhood, Mr Meng, are also accused of schikanous attacks and education of a criminal union.
"We want not only to make the participants responsible, but if there is a organization that has sanctionsed this - of officially or inoffectively - we will also take them to account," Wagner said on a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has rejected their association with the local group.
This will improve when the feed increases the rates
A rental increase comes, and the houses will be rented, the rental will grow, and the economy will fall into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it will be stopped.
In addition, the story offers only small guidelines for the economic.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first rate increase and was 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve is often, even though not always, a greater reaction to the economy and financial facilities.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have so intensely highlighted that investors should not be able to be able to do so when they begin to increase the rates, but more than the period required for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
However, market shareholders could conclude that the whole account could have been transferred because of an increase in interest.
"The first increase of the feed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted unnecessaryly by some as a sign for the end of the era of the "fair money", said Julian Jessop, Chefökonom of Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we are not expecting the general return of US rates to normal heights, but still too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that seems to be scared to many.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effects.
This is a history-based trend on how some sectors of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen last month, prevention of interest increases can make things volatil for a while.
Once the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"It seems to be a tendency to kill assets 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in the money policy," German bank analystes said in a newer interval, which results in the increase in the prices of the feed.
In the past 35 years, the market is mostly in the surrounding stream - approximately 14 Pro > - on the way to increase the interests, quite flat in the 250 days after which (a average winning of 2,6 per ), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with a average pension in the past six cycles of 14,4 Pro ± a recent analysis that is published by Bob Doll, the Chief of Investment in Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The German Bank said that the effects on the shares were trends later in the raising cycle and the pensions started to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but increasing prices often promote them.
In the current case, the feed is confronted with certain conditions that were not before and that could accelerate a recession.
In addition, it is noted that the Brutto-inland product will be near its lowest point at an increasing price of the feed.
According to Germane Bank, the 118 rates increased since 1950 only two times the nominal BIP was under 4.5 Pro.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 Pro, only few expect that this will endure and expect the quarter of the Atlanta Fed only 1.5 Pro.
Increases of interest in such a fragile economic culise may be risky and ask the question: "If this time is different," said the German Bank.
The market shareholders have made themselves all the year to an increase in price of the feed asth, and all the eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
As many strategies and economys believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the future trade provides only a probability of 25 Pro.
"In our areas, all increase cycles from 1950 to today have been located in a super cycle with a low-swerm cycle at the BIP and prerecession boxes very quickly after the beginning of the recovery," says the report.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst resistance in the observed phase.
The current cycle is the longest of the feed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatil because the market predicts an increase of interest, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital.
The main decline is that the effect on investment is faster than on actions when they change their strategic course.
In the case of training, the rentals appear to change the direction, soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the elevation cycle, the leaders fall immediately, said the German Bank.
The strategy of Charles Schwab believes that the increase in the price rates will lead to a closer summary of rents between longer and less loans and leads to a flashing of the curve.
High-foreign contributions often bring better revenues in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect receipt," Kathy Jones, Fixed Income Analyst in Sweb, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that the markets have already been adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"Besides the strength of the inflation expectations and the decrease of inflation, there are some signs that the market has been adapted to the view of stronger monetary policy."
Short-term rates are decreased, the rent curve is flash, the credit rates have extended and the volatility is increased - all the characteristics of the market when the feed is strengthening their areas.
In the large and whole, companies that develop the largest part of their business activity in the United States will benefit from the increase in price rates and more attractive local products.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse, since an increased increase of their products on the global market and also the financing of their debts.
"The story shows that "Quality-" action aims to respond three months after an initial interest increase," said Goldman Sachs Sachs analysts in a report for customers.
Companies with strong bi-by-by-counters have overcamed 5 percentage points after each expenditure of 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Company with high capital rents and low volatility in their shares also overcame their pens with low quality at average 4 (propoints) and 3 (proposition points).
Debts will be a big problem.
Company with a high share of flexible rates will be lost mostly, said Goldman.
Outside of the pure action games, consumers will also benefit from the increased.
Sparers could see wins through rental, even if experts are different opinions, how quickly it will be found.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Parliament member Andrew Bingham
The Conservative member of the Parliament criticized the sender because of his "constitution"
He claims that it is not to distinguish anyway from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they just imitated the Brits
Parliament's college Damien Collins adopted the vote and said this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "goes" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of the parliament and makes new pressure on the sender to prove that he does something he does not do.
The Conservative Deputy Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC boss that the public-lovened radio sender was to be "dummy" and still not to distinguish from his commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like the word "fortunes" - but it seems to be Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards that started in December last.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year seem to be the Brits only under another name.
So, if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples in which you are just imitating what is already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
The BBC Director-General pointed back the proposals and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far before his commercial competitors when it was about live music and public replication.
What I learn from Radio 3 I'll learn about classic music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment for live music and musicians that is really unovercome.
"And finding the commitment of radio 3, new music and giving new works in order, I think it really is important," he said.
In the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argumented that it must be able to engage the public when it was done in the past because the British are less informed about classic music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only element of the BBC production that, during the consultation of the Committee for the Selection of Culture, Media and Sports, was to reach the commercial rivals.
The Tory Deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC, which was bought by the Netherlands Product Talpa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marked?
Lord Hall pointed out that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced as "on special BBC way".
He wants the company to "find a hit out of our household stall" when it starts a chat series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of additional series of The Voice in the future or to give the money of the tax payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet outlines increased in August on the most slowest and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
In the first three months of 2015 there were seven Pro-Increase in online sales.
Last month, the lowest result was since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales strengthened three years ago using phones to purchase
Experts believe that the Black Friday burned the dead in November
For more than a year, the acquisition has been treated, and many of the main income streets of Britain have become spiritually spiritual.
However, experts say that there are signs now that the online ums are stagnizing, after new numbers showed only seven pro in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five pro-creasing towards the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that stagnizing online sales after new numbers showed only seven pro pro growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous year and go back to 2000, it has always developed during the time," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales were strengthened three years ago as buyers started to purchase the purchases with their phone.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different areas, for example home on the sofa.
But now it's going to happen, and we may experience that growth's decreasing.
The Black-Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is quoted as a reason for the remaining ranges.
Experts believe that buyers hold their purchases before this event, each one finds place on the last Friday in November.
In the past year, the average number of buyers around their computers was cut five times, and some traders' web sites disappeared.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the purchasers were fighting for shops, buyers could stop buying.
A Property of the British Retail Consortium discovered that a little more than 1 £ online was issued by 5 £ depths.
In some products such as television and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now carried out through web shops.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people bought clothing and shooting online instead of in the chains inside.
Muslims buried the killed in Mekka during the Kran accident - Bin Laden family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are made by muslims in the first signatures in Mekka through the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the summary part of the large Saudi Bin-Laden Group to the load
The Ministry of Health said that, too, 394 people were hurt after the Kran was lost
Hundreds of Muslims gathered together, when 29 of the victims were held by the streets to bury those killed when a crown of Mekka's Grand Moschee.
Trists, widely clothed in white, were the streets to deal with their respect, when the first of the dead came to their last trip to Al-Moaissem F'hof.
The triumph process passed on the Holy Stations, where only days before a baukran crossed the cover of the moschee and then struck on the prayers.
The bodies were released to the sepulchre when the Saudi King for the building of the family Bin Laden because of the disaster that also left 394 vulnerable people was charged with a sanction.
The bodies of 29 bearers killed when a crown fell through the Great Central Moschee of Mekkas were thrown through the streets.
Among the dead, Qasim Akram was from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first trip, when the Kran was cut down.
Mr Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the year's Haddsch in the Great Moschee.
Saudi-Offelle have already told that the Haddsch to Mekka will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have left the hand of the crown when he was not used.
A Arabic version of the decree published by the State of Saudi Press Agency said that the Binload Group was responsible for the breakdown.
The English service of the news agency did not report this details, but said that the carrier of the company was prohibited by foreign travels.
The beginning of this week, Salman promised to enthusiasm, which caused the corner of the crown, who cut into a coast of the Great Moschee, where hundreds of thousands of muslims were gathered before the Haddsch, which later was located in this month.
The Binload Group has not issued any statements on the breakout of the Krans, and their representatives were not available for a opinion.
The Royal Decree also declined the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Thousands of crowns surrounded in Mekkas Grand Moschee as part of the massive building, leading by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected to the dominant family of Saudi Arabia for years and has taken greater building projects.
The devastated leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a detrimental son who was devoted by the family in the 1990s.
The disturbance of the crown came among strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the Kingdom for the trips that at least once is necessary in the life of every healthy muslim.
The officers said that 158 people stay in the hospital.
Governing representatives claimed that 1 million Rial (£174.000) should be devoted to the members of the killed and the same sum of permanent damage.
Other injured ones receive the help of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of the fair east handworkers is over
British employment continued handworker, says Veronique Laury
The number of employees from Eastern Europe has increased behind
This leads to 200 other Screwfix countries to be opened for handworkers
At the same time Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales in the country
From Rupert Ste日, City Chef Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British decline their hair and pins in favour of the use of qualified east workers who perform the work in their home.
If you are sent with a hammer or a pince to deal with walls, you appear to be a minority today.
Because British workers continue to work in their homes, the leader of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, a new business leader of Kingfisher, who is the tree force chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe, offering services to deepest prices, was inter alia.
Therefore Kingfisher plans to open 200 additional Screwfix Shops, which are addressed to handworkers and to close 60 B&Q sales.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q-shops, because eight of the purchase decisions are found by women.
At the moment, overview the men in the workers.
She said it was necessary to set up the growing demographic trends that show more women's single maintenance, which take more renovation than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There's still a majority of men in our age.
We have to move this more to a balanced weight.
In principle, the assistance of our customers from women with 80% of the decisions on purchasing articles by women.
Women play a great role in the decision process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of the only five women at the top of a British Index in FTSE100, has also restructured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leading positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company who has exactly 50% of the team with women, his business management and funding.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision -- if this is a important topic.
It was not difficult to find women for our advice.
Kingfisher indicated a decline in half-year winning and the ranges after the group trained the costs for closing the lands.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, the Screwfix and B&Q are opening 200 new.
Functionaries of Aich/Dob due to infidelity before court
At the Court of Justice Klagenfurt, two functionaries of the Austrian Volleyball Visumeist Aich/Dob must have been responsible for disloyalty and tax interruption.
The complaints are not guilty.
One of them was also accused of misuse.
From this proposal, he was legally released in May.
Current process was deleted.
According to the Supergovernmental Lawyer Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, was a criterion that the complaints used for private purposes in 2006 to 2011 for the United Nations accounts on which they were able to be available in their functions.
The damage is about 400,000 euros.
Sport functioners are also accused of financial proceedings.
This room distinguished the president of the Creation Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It shall be negotiated at a later time.
In the case of the disloyalty, the defence claimed that the United Nations had not occurred at a time.
The Sport Functionaries had only calculated injury and the Sport Club for which they were occupied from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the passivs were charged by about 600,000 shilling in 2001 (EUR 44,000).
"The time we were before the situation: do we continue or lock the club?", said one of the complainants in the Broadcast of the Financial Office.
With colleagues and complainants, he then decided to take this task.
With all the risks.
"We have proposed money to put our life insurance as a security to the bank," he said in the agreement.
The agreement has been agreed: You can freely manage the money, it can only be made no debt.
Furthermore, in the case of a corresponding financial success, the payment of insurance was re-effective until 1991.
Thus, some of the injuries were paid only years later, namely since 2003, when a plus was on the account.
Thus, pauschal and not detail records appeared, and the former obsequent reported the operations.
The accounts and sparbooks managed the two complaints together, said the second complaint.
Why the payments were not reported to the Unit in detail, the judge asked.
The Union was not interested in detail for the financial debt; it was important if only the freedom of debt was the answer.
At the beginning of 2011 against a functional investigation on improving official misuse, a amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the Association account.
The complaints declared that it had been rejected.
This credit account went on the name of the second complaint and was not stated to the Unit.
"Why?", wanted the judge to know.
The question was not answered for a long time.
Then he thought he believed that this was the best for the unit.
If he had done something, no one knew anything about this money, the lawyer would have put it in the room.
The complainant was informed, the officer was justified.
This translation was formulated as "scade recycling".
Why damage?, Judge and State lawyer wanted to know.
The first complaint explained that he had not agreed with this formulation because the union had never been injured.
But what am I to do when the lawyer says, "You are all out of the cut."
"I am a legal representative?" asked he.
Furthermore, the functionary said he never had a cent content, he calculated only miles of money and diet.
At diets he has taken into account the unit of EUR 1,000 per month, but the actual approach has been very difficult to add.
Exact documents for the early years were not able to show the complaints.
They explained that these were no longer maintained after a operational examination in which everything was considered correctly.
The second complaint was also charged with miles of money.
All injuries were made in bar, and he had to go to the Bank from the residence of the peoples to Bleiburg, explained in his statement.
The main negotiation will continue on 23 September with the question of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard strikes more 300,000 jobs
In addition, for three years, the computer rice will reduce further jobs in the collection of the company.

A repeated disappointment of PCs and a weaker application of firms for its services were added to the second largest PC manufacturer worldwide to Lenovo.
In the business quarter at the end of July, the paragraph of PC and printers returned at 11,5 Pro.
The conversion falls by 8 Pro to approximately 25.4 billion.
The ransoms returned in 15 of 16 quarters.
HP answers with a collection and massive places on the exchange in the branch.
The 76-year old company under Meg Whitman's carrier has only reacted lately to strengthening customers' artphones and tablets to buy ordinary computers and to do more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans generally view the reduction of approximately 55.000 places.

Deads in Delta State's leaves excuses
After shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shoot and killed his colleagues on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it "leads" to him at the first murder and wants to "he can make it unexpected", they gave the authorities on Tuesday.
The police in Gpēer, Mississippi, said that Lamb, Do日 for Geographic and Social Scientific Education at Delta State, called the call number at 10:00 on Monday morning
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the employee of the emergency center that the police should send police officers home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also realized that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will sing", but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb didn't make any clothes for his shoes.
When the police met the scene, they found the body of Amy Printiss, 41, and a manuscript note of Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to cancel it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb passed 300 miles to Delta State, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he took his own life on Monday evening, when the cops resigned him.
President of University William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb thought that the printiss also had a relationship with Schmidt said to the authorities on Tuesday, there was "no information, no evidence" for a "trick relationship".
Printiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married about seven years as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but friends remained.
O'Steen said he and Printiss had a daughter who is 19, and she was "on the ground".
He said that Printiss was his daughter "Absolutely best friends".
Printiss online from home, according to the statement of Linsday Knowles, which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Printiss.
Knowles said that Printiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had met with Lamb for about three years.
"You always wanted to help others," Knowles said
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He's not going into prison."
When cops took him on the highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb moved his car to the side, fled to the foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctor title in the early 2015 from Delta State, such as his lifeslaw on the University's website.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United can't play months for double fracture
Luke Shaw presents a double fraction of his right bone at the Champions-League download of Manchester at PSV Endhoven.
Since this is the left foreign defendant to wine and will exclude it from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not expect Shaw to play again in this season.
The damage was caused by an unrespectable attack by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw was interrupted in the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes in the game field and needed oxygen before he was brought into the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double bone fraction and is in the hospital."
He's been transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it's very difficult and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
He had a mask of oxygen in the cabinet.
He wept.
I'm not Ar, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have disappeared with a red card and the decline of an elf meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the District Judge, didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believed that the Italian dispute judge was wrong.
You can evaluate for yourself when I say a elf meter and a red card were random.
It was a very worst attack with two legs.
"I thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how I'm, my way to heal now, I'm going back stronger."
Before: Manchester United leads to the loss of Luke Shaw at the download at PSV
The Defensor of England, with the European Mastership in France, has a successive incentive to recover until June coming.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad damage."
If a player with this kind of damage leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It is never the purpose of our players to hurt an enemy.
Moreno seems to have a bone break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland men at the WM 2014.
"He's doing very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy, and when you're hearing that it's a very bad damage, it's not good," said Cocu.
For me it wasn't possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction, so it looked like he had touched him [Moreno], but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In talking to SBS6 Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a fool game of Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David Cameron the Lorax knows better?
It's a thing that all parents learn soon: If your child lies a book, it's not long until you almost know it outside.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When he was asked by a supplier of childcare systems to call his favorite child book, the President of the Lorax, the environmental facility of Dr. Seuss, was dismissed in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "Drawful, moved, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book I like to read my children, because it seems always to give a picture or message that we have lost until now."
Everything nice and good, except that the following paragraph, which appears to be described in the Cameron's work of the book, rather than repeat the contents of the 2012 film version to add the new characters and details to expand the very short original text.
"Inside the murdered city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has passed and even the air is a good, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by filling his desire to see a real tree," reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose right name was Theodor Seuss Geissel and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if this would not be adequate enough: the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lorax movie film presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a good, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he is a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little trusted in the work of the book. Here is a unnamed boy, such as the local environment falling through the money, trees, Thneed striking once-ler despite the Protest of the named Lorax, a hotly, brushing being, "which speaks in the name of the trees", is devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR assignment was delegated to a helper that the Lorax did not have 20 times behind a child.
A Downing Street speaker said that the text was probably coming from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps assured that the text of Cameron workers was delivered, but there were no more direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England, but it is still difficult
To join Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the frame that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series download is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an external.
Alastair Cooks page is probably less learned than three years ago, but there are spine players in the Batting building, and the Community spirit is strong; they will not be narrows from 2012, only a youth-faced attitude.
The ball develops Moeen Ali as Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at the test level, it is a option for the attack.
After this message: Adam Lyth separates from the English test chader and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, to me as his leader in Yorkshire, difficult to analyze.
At his seven tests, there were two attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple, but hard reality is that Kricket players are set up on results.
There was no question marks in Joe Root, for example, and that led to nomination, there - and I said this before - players are their best electors.
A long time ago, Lyth's running would have been prolonged, but he had the control over his own shock room.
If he hopes to expose more fluids for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The English-Trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not produce such performances, and that does not surprise me; he is especially a teamman.
The question of how much time a test-shlagman gets to put his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the opportunity to play home and outside.
The only prospect you can highlight was that England first put Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth in highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a slagman I appreciate.
He is a X-Factor Cricket player, which we saw in Yorkshire early in this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bri's place, which was very meant us.
He needs at least the same opportunities as those before him, but this depends, of course, on the maintenance in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of putting Moeen near Cook, which brings an extra-spin-bowler and would get four quicks, was up, and I don't have anything against it.
I don't see why a slagman can't hurt there, and this left hand has already shown that he is a devil of Cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big subdivision.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he arrived in 2001 as opener.
He created three hundreds immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the frame as back-up spinner, and in my limited relationship with him he has very impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - average 31 with the killer and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup spinners that lift their hands up and the tragedies have decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Despite the manship, England has made a few smart supplements at the tra’stab.
The name of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a counselor for the test games could be a mastercoup.
He is one of the most nice guys of the game that will bring a fashion of experiences because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white bowl phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setting.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as player or as coach, and how Mahela has ideas that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the cabin can bring fresh wind, even if the messages are in accordance with the previous.
Colly Team College at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One Days, the Root has received a similar break against and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and team builders do not determine the time schedule.
And you must remember that as players depend their jobs on the results.
Such decisions will not be made easy in the heart.
The Brexit Lager (Brexit = increase in the United Kingdom from the EU) could gain access if the economy was running into a float until 2017
David Cameron's unexpected new negotiations strategy to maintain the United Kingdom in the EU will be deeper in difficulties every day, even without the choice of the genial Jeremy "Is it or not?" Corbyn to the leader of Labor or the TUC, which strikes hardly for Europe on Saturday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A recent diplomatic friend said that some Member States, which are so deep in different crisiss as the EU is now and not always from their own faults, the United Kingdom himself created agenda with divided events and contractual changes, which they do not want, are safe.
In Brighton, the TUC disappeared at its annual assembly that it doesn't like it if they provide social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Minister for Finance are held at a gipfel meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a photo of themselves before a famous local memory, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they won for reforms.
It's always about me.
My dear friend, who wants to look forward to the United Kingdom inside the EU area - "Let us not only with France," says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short-term ministers and officers have come to the point where they do not care whether we stay or go.
Germany, specially designed officer Angela Merkel, is an associate, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it has happened in the overflow long endurance such as Thatcher (11 years), the middlerand (14) and the carbon (16).
France's François Holland looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a crazy force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will be cut off a bone to help the selfy-breeds that should better use energy to prevent Scotland's outcome from the UK - something they do not want because most of the similar separatist trends.
Thus, some of these ministers may even plan in the SNP style, while British Reference Campaign 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, thinks my friend.
"The new negotiation was a pleit" and "The United Kingdom has won nothing from the new negotiation."
The Europeans know how crucial the Fleet Street can be on their costs and who EU skeptics is the oligarchis of the presse barone, as they were not in 1975, but were not supporting our 1973 accession with a proportion of 2:1.
You can weakly remind Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro-opportunist who has made a name as a "EU-Light-Banana" Brussel Correspondent in the early 90s.
At all his foolishness, Ed Miliband knew who were his enemies.
This was the Medley of tax-servidor shocks, telephone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-inlanders, which are most of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but she found that when you sit with a warm Gorilla in a coffee, you better distribute bananas to refuse it instead of become dinner and dinner.
In fact, the Miliband was more blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum, because Blair had put the principle on the unnecessary constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and the Netherlands electors in 2005, which opened him a back door.
The press has never done this to him.
But the beautiful Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly lock on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he had no time to forget for me - seems to repeat Neil Kinnock's Boykott Murdoch of the 80s, a mistake at the time and today.
It can dure, but he needs to develop a coherent to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyns of the European position is - I'll express it friendly - in the development.
He says we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside the Ukips traditional bruising tension and the wilderness of Torys Small-Englishism can probably say yes to everyone.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn said in the radio and television this week when the pathfinder struck in him, not to admit that the name of Corbyns was a bad idea of the provocating John McDon's shadow cancer.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried to be unclean against his Laboratory cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hillary's fight was still more attractive.
But to fight to stay "in all circumstances" - Benns' expression - was not what McDon said, nor what JC told his companions and members after all reports on their clausuring meeting on Montagaged.
Whatever you want to provide the touching Bottom up-image of Corbyn - remember that he even touched me - News-Disslin remains important in the age of TV around the hour, and above all things in the social media struggle, a breakfast of Paranoia and Tradition.
It is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to maintain Labors support in the reference campaign for self-comprehensiveness, as McDon said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDon and Corbyn's basic majority for EU membership - in accordance with their Bennite camping industry, its anti-capitalist past - is not a question of the exoterical debate among the left dissidents for which the Narcissism of the small subdivision is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his majority to Nato - Tom Watson, Felsenfest is convinced that JC doesn't start out campaign - foreign diplomats will be required to try to find a sense for their representatives at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin disappear political capital, - they also have disgraceful electors - to make consents to the British if this can be unconscious?
The United States are already very disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and inside, even with a decreasing cost of the Tory Government at the power, which I was told of something that was called British Influence Security Forum at the beginning of Monday.
Experts criticize Report of Public Health England on E-cigarettes
A Stately financed agency that e-cigarettes are less damaged than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 persons, partly with connections to tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "base report" last month and described it as a "complete review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have interviewed the difficulty of data and shown the connections between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
A guideline in the Medical Journal Lancet adopted the "extraordinaryly windful basis" on which the PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the arms "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor for European Public Health at the London High School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor for Clinical Epidemiology at the face of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is to be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that the PHE's claim that "the current best damage is that e-cigarettes are less damage than smoking" based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who have been invited to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The results of the meeting were included in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose business leader had to have previously received from British American Tobacco funds (BAT).
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, said they.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting explained receiving funds from an e-cygarette manufacturer, but not the financing he would have received from the Philip Morris International reports before.
The reasons for the selection of members of the Gremio are not provided, but there are several e-cygarette champions, some of which also indicate a branch financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this session are not for their Know-how in the tab control.
The PHE also participated in the meeting.
The research work of the group is "depreciatedly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products at the majority of the criteria", says McKee and Capewell.
However, no such connections or restrictions will be discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's arms that "not yet evidence that e-cigarettes have served as a way to smoke for children or non-rounders".
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director for Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's arms had already been reacted before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are essentially less damage than smoke."
Each second life-long smoker is looking for him.
All evidence draws near that the health risks of e-cygarettes are low in comparison with it, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about the evidence and what is not, especially if there is so many public confusions about the relatives in comparison to the tabak.
Nearly 800,000 people die each year in a illness regarding smoke, and smoke costs the national health system two billion £ per year.
In the clear statement of current evidence that e-cygarettes are not without risk, but only a breakdown of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should leave EastEnders, says the former Chief of Channel 4
The former president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give your right arm" for Hit shows like Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the taxes should only be used to make the type of programmes not sent by other UK senders.
He criticized the BBC in order to place public-loven programmes, which probably will be seen by a smaller public, in a heavy conflict with time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and from senders like BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to make more partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to contact the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC provides or sends programmes that would also be clearly shown by non-subventioned rivals," Johnson said to the Supreme Communication Committee under his research on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the taxes that I don't think for a medium- or long-term idea, at least it should be produced on programmes that are not doing or giving it in order.
You send The Voice in a first classic time window because they want to obtain a largest support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a crazy, it's ridiculous, it's naturally unconscious.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax programme is financed, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program that EastEnders is another, distributed measure of both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm to it.
I strive to see how this public-local television should be.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a businessman for series, leading Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was guilty of the jail after evaluation "for the ambitions of people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular sendings of the BBC give it back to what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in Edinburgh MacTaggart proposed in 2003 that the BBC shows as EastEnders should cover.
Johnson said that the public-loven programmes should go to BBC4 where you can't measure the public, but they're fulfilling their tasks, and they can argue if they go on their apparent missions to justify 4 billion £, "Now, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
You put them in a time window where no one wanted to see her.
To the tax, Johnson said to the Committee: "I call you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions that can be obtained the best of this.
Of course, you're all thinking, we're all thinking that you get a big value here for 150 £ per year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £, ask me if it is true because they don't consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also spoke before the Committee on Saturday, requested the BBC to verify their Reithian mission, "inform, form and interview".
He said that only a little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% in the radio - and she should take an example to the public-local televisors and Canada to change this in "inform, open and interview".
About the partnerships Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms of which he said that only a handheld is shown in television, and enter with the commercial senders Allians to make all available online.
'Son ́tics' can control brain numbers by shadow wheels
The video shows how the non-deads change the direction at the moment when they are controlled with sound impulses.
Weapons with geneticly modified nervous systems that can be controlled by exhausts of shallwells.
The winners change the direction at the moment when they are controlled with sound impulses that have too high frequency for the human listener to be heard.
The impulses work by activating motoneuron cells that are geneticly modified to make the membrane channels reacting to Ultrashall walls.
More about this subject: Read and write Hirna with light
The scientists said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son·tics, which can be used in the ultrashall to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation, a invasive procedure, the electric impulse in the brain of humans to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Fadenwurms usually do not respond to Ultrashall, but Chalasani determined that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bluses.
The blasses, he found out, strengthen the ultrashall walls that then enter into the worms.
The strengthened ultrashall whales affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms.
The hallwells affect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned as a Nature Communications report.
In order to create Ultrashall-controlled non-dodes, Chalasani geneticly changed the worms so that some of its motoneurone TRP-4 ion channels are .
If he applies ultrashall on the changed creatures, the hallwalls will be strengthened by the microblocks and over the worms, where they activate the changed motoneurone.
The procedure has made some similarities with Opt°tics, a bath-breaking tool that enables the communist to enable and disable neurons with impulses of the light.
But Chalasani said that Son ́tics could have some advantages to this technology.
In contrast to light, which must be sent down at a optical fashion to the desired place in the brain, low frequency ultrashall waves can be prevented and can so be sent to the brain from above on the skin.
"We believe that with genetherapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the human neurons assigned temporarily accidentally for the Ultrashall signal in a clinical position for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications may be able to handle muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, if it adds.

The shows deploy British weapons trade
Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Messen-Video.
Heavy killer drones!
Fucking legs inflammating legs!
Streubben!
And electrochock stones that cause walking pain, but don't leave track!
The joyful voice and the Cartoon images do not doubt that this show for the world's largest weapons is a warfare parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the British Government to the airlight, to distort weapons of repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree in the ExCeL Centre in London Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many places that are at bus holdings and in the U-Bahn moves and require a second corner.
"It's important announcement: Docklands Light Railway with the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) you read in the fonts of London underground and the DLR line marks that go to the image of a panzer.
In September, a warm of weapons traders will run with the DLR ... Customers will be asked to help while stoping the weapons.
The 300 places are of artists who have exposed their work in the Museum for Great Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collector named Special Patrol Group helped to distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hacḱks", a 6 £ inbus key package, which claims that "access to around a third of bus holding areas on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this placate "Vandalismus".
One of the parodia indicators produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, Kurator of Designs and Do in the Essex, artists will be critical and will try to bring political work to the public outside of galeries.
Artists are active in protest movements to work and note that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art affects the society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade plates welcomes the pendlers in the U-Bahn.
The amnesty video was viewed more than 1000,000 times in 24 hours over Facebook and was found by the VCCP advertising, which is useless with the grapher and Voiceover artist, which also is free.
The VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was amazing about the silence that ruled around the advertising for the weapons - through a empty place of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let us give them the campaign to avoid them."
They played with the finding of a more realistic double business advertising, but "including with light colors and animations, it remains stronger."
"You have done a fantastic job by helping us to cover the consciousness of the sale of illegal folter devices on the messe," said Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we now need is a vote of the British Government and the guarantee that the floor devices are not treated illegally before our home door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapons is coming from the area within ExCeL, where the exhibitor is increasingly eufemistic products.
In a press message, Saab opens an US army's order on "the AT4CS RS shot by the sculptor".
This includes a "uniformly formed battle cap, which provides the great effects of effects within the goal."

Eight golden rules for life in student homes
11 years ago, I went as self-forgotten 19-year-old in a student's home, still in the faith in Beret and morality, but I just now remember the deepest beds of those I've threatened - and the numerous, long-atmosphere complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be destilled in eight simple rules.
The entry into student homes is enough from easily nervous to too scared.
It's exciting to sweat: people tell where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath Year, where you stand about Corbyn and why you "really said Marmite don't love nor hate, because seriously, boys, it's just a hepheextract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Respire.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It links the talk and helps you find people you like, in contrast to those with whom you wouldn't talk, even if your winters were burning in the fire and these were fire-free.
Let people go.
The rooms of people are often converted into tree receptions, film-night events and communal matching points, but they are also the places in which people are attached and depressed.
Better: Do not remember starting with a relationship at the University
Introverted receives a serious treatment at the University.
Your room should be a repository, but many students are a room-to-room bummel culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life-long friendship.
That can be the hire for someone who tries to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave to get back the energy I have used for interaction with you."
Try to see where a comiliton is created of ability - and send him a SMS place to cross.
About claiming: Do it.
A guy in my student's homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by backs.
Since you start the University at the top of the back-many, it's the slip at the doors of people to imagine with a full brownies teller, less rare than the 1950's welcome "Welcome in the neighborhood, I've got something back to you. So, and now, please laugh if I ask you a few personal questions."
A good way to close friendships is offering household leckery.
Your inhabitants feel obliged to interview and may finally associate your face with a beautiful surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are an anxious backer.
Bad mixed clothes of meal, sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you reap.
Stealing food is a committee crime in student homes.
Of course, the cloud of couchs is a deep steel, but is it to take a trop of milk for your tea?
Check this with the milk.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves even if they cook inside.
When someone steals your things, it's harmful, and you have my compassion - but try to handle more equivalently than my cohabitant who adds her milk to punish diet.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a larm that keeps people from sleep or from work.
It is not just about being an anxious man, but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass.
A girl on my floor asked her neighbors whether it could make them something easier for Drum & Bass, because it was three hours tomorrow, and she had a test on the morning.
They reacted to this with a lot of music.
When she stopped at 5 a.m., she friendly left her neighbors sleep two hours before she left her own music, locked her door and went to her three-time test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future marriage mate would eventually enter the same student home?
Would it not be extremely penalty if you hold a cohabitant for your future marriage mate, join her, get herself separate again, and then see her every day and may survive how she overcome all the common friends to herself?
Of course, the heart goes his own ways - but if a warm inhabitant is definitely not your future marriage mate, at least try to introduce a little understanding to your sublime.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys inside an unlocked room, the border is between a ulk and Mobbing fe, as it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it only takes moments until he gets to bumerang.
By hiding a valuable and amazing lesson about security - but never hurt any room with teeth pasta and Shampoo.
Close your door, and put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the fridge - but do not close your own possessions on the cover more than twice.
Room houses for refugees, All Facilities, Low Servers
The real estate undertaking Markus Gildner builds in the Middle-France Eckental series houses for people who don't have much money.
So about refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need residence, but also the only learning mother and the low-servant."
"I'm showing how you can build well today," says 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will get to the apartment.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly a favorable living room can be created: he builds in a project of order houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be forced to the apartment.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive delivery in containers or tournails has no sustainability.
Because the people remain in a large part here.
In view of the fleeting stream, we also need sufficient residence in the next year.
A completely banal, three-coated row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house is at least a place.
It easiers integration.
It's different if you put people in the habitation blocks.
Each of the six houses built just in the pilot project consists of three units for each four asylum applicants.
Each living unit has two rooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a stay room.
It may be that many refugees will say that it's peace again, I'll go back.
Then the households can be easily rebuild in accordance with the relevant needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square metres residence per house is about 184 000 euros, without base.
That's overviewable.
Six months the building has suffered.
That's right.
Did the building rules complicate their plans?
Gildner: Constructionally, I have correctly carried out my project.
Becoming complicated, it always makes the threatening Damocles weight special building and the stational regulation.
Great.
It is still understood who creates three apartments in a series house needs at least three places.
Only in the cities there is no place for it.
And refugees and asylum candidates have no cars.
How did the inhabitants respond to their order house project?
Gildner: There were some who foretold me to create luxury buildings for asyl applicants.
What's definitely wrong.
But don't you strengthen the competition battle for payable apartments?
Gildner: True is: We had a building in Germany in the last five years, but there were luxual apartments that were not able to enjoy any more.
My project has the message, also the normal people need a living room.
Not only refugees, but also the only parent or the low-servant.
I show how to build well and well today.
That's why.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and worked with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How do you get the new iPhone operating system when Apple updates are published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration application, typing "General" and then select "Software Updates".
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have been sent to problems after installing because it has received an error message that reports that the "Software Updating" has failed.
To cope with the problem, users will be recommended to wait or wait until the storm returns or try to update over iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the process.
This may mean the deletion of applications to create space - but Apple has made it more probably by refreshing the update. It will also be easier to do this if you use a special tool to remove applications and then install them again, unless the process is completed.
It will be rewarded to ensure that your mobile phone has been loaded during updating or is near a load device so that the battery is loaded.
If the loading is too low, Apple does not allow the update to be continued, since the phone may be disabled by halfway and this could lead to a break of the update.

You should also ensure that before downloading your checklist you have reviewed all things to prevent things running wrong and slinging, if they do it. iOS 9 brings new functions, including a much smarter personal assistant and a huge new product features for the iPad, the same changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only Devise: Full Attacke
Nico Rosberg knows the WM title in formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton only a devise: "Volle Attacke".
The WM second pointed out before starting the seven decided overseas runs, "that I have nothing to lose."
53 Points separate the vice-wheelmaster before the division in Singapore on this Sunday from Title defensors and double-champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the twelve seasons before and takes the flight-ground price in the city as a favourite attack.
2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British could win the running.
Should the current state of city affect the great price of Singapore, it is still unclear.
Since days, a dark cloud is hanging over the city, exhausted by fires on the neighborhood island Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schach club has a prominent member
The "Chachfriend Bad Kissingen" based schach club three months awarded another member in his order, thus the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate shock and tennis player who stayed more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen to Kur.
Gauselmann is the trainer of the Federal Service Cross 1 class and honor citizens of the cities Espel camp and Lübbecke.
The Schach club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a spending that has encountered the President Alfred Klein.
It is possible to stay up to players who can't give up the member's contribution.
Youth work and talent search should also be advanced.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership of the Shach club and also friendly contact with the Tennis Club "Rot-white" be viewed as an expression of his association with the Kurstadt.
Quarters office search direct contact
Saludis and the older antonists have joined themselves under the main of the social funding and opened a new staff-stauffenberg place.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses.
The social establishment descends from the mountain to the inner city.
Exactly said to the Graph Stauffenberg place.
There was recently opened a new quarter office.
Here, directly beyond the purchases, will be obtained from elders and advisers immediately on questions such as supervisory insurance or services of hospitals and supervisors.
For years, with our ambulant supervisory service, we have concluded that people often are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Not rarely many services of the casses will not be taken into charge because the complexity of insurance is not yet understandable," said the new hero Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the antonist and civil capital and for the ambulant service "Amadeus".
Besides the consultations, the new quarter office offers prevention, health shorts and wellness.
This is what the Saludis was taken into the ship.
Therefore, additive offers such as urine prevention, memory nitration or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers from the older room and the Saludis are completed in a perfect way.
Saludis is for prevention, preservation and Reha.
"The elder's room for maintenance and care," he painted Heike Riedel, business leader of Saludis.
The reason for the development of the new quarter office in the town is that both business leaders are particularly in the demographic exchange.
Because this makes a decentral infrastructure in the individual cities of Bamberg in the future.
Moreover, as the citizen Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the vacation feasts, the quarter office also refers to the age agreement: "There are many events and offers on the program and they are invited to a regular community.
This is a great contribution to the social establishment that elders can live in their trusted environment as far as possible.
The quarter office is opened Monday, midnight and Friday from 9 to 14 hours, Tuesday and Tuesday from 16 to 18 hours and Saturday from 10 to 12 hours.
Bamberg entity against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the date for the game FC Intracht Bamberg against the third-ligist Würzburger Kickers has not been set on 6 October, it was now set as a date on 6 October.
The meeting of the FC Intracht Bamberg in the eightfinal of the Bayer Football Totopokals against the third guest FC Würzburger Kickers has now been completed.
Played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 19 p.m. in Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we know now where the game is going over the stage, now we have planning security," so FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the currently started map recycling.
It is especially for our community to play against a third guest.
We therefore hope for a number of viewers, and this is not without reason, because flood light games have a special trip.
In the last 16 mentioners, the FC Intracht Bamberg 2010 entered the victory of the district lightist 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and home against the Regional Lighters 1. FC Schwenfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and is qualified for the first part of the DFB Association Pocal 2016/2017.
Title defensor is a third-party spVgg underheaching.
Wiener Architect Karl Mang 92-year-old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of the Vienna architecture, is dead.
He has already died on 5 September in 92 years, as the artist's house reported on Tuesday.
With many, the artist's house loses a member of honor and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the sending.
In 1922, many studied in Vienna during and after the Second World War Architecture at the Technical High School in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952, he was a freedom of architect, but he was also employed as teacher, writer and institutional leader.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute for Formation.
In the 80s, he was assigned with the establishment of the treasury room in Wiener Hofburg and the construction of the Palais Lobkowitz to the Austrian theater museum.
Parkstrafe: Tim Wiese is a cop with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has been incredible in bremen.
Footballer was once, in the middle of time, Tim Wiese, an ex-national guard in Germany and in Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have placed in the past two years, according to his own statement.
However, he has not added intellectually.
Wiese just cut his hair in the bremer town, when he saw a parking guardian outside made a penalty for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
How did it turn out from the business, the officer made it well and threw her the casual penalties before her feet, as reported by the "image" quotation.
In the town of Bremen, the prospects are incurred, but the consequences of the unusual incident are still not clear.

One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghanistan, followed his two friends in a distance of about five meters, and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was located at the height of the bft station.
There were also three persons in the area of the tank site.
One of these men now cried to the youth and struck him in the face.
The victim takes a nose breathing and blooded strongly out of the nose.
When both of his friends joined and accused the murderer, he also left off of sacrifices.
His friends now brought the wounded young man home.
The worker followed the group with a pkw to their apartment and went out there several times.
When the vehicle was not seen anymore, the vulnerable went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the killer and another man.

Dr. Frank Mâer takes the practice of rock houses and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Mâer-Gongoll and Frank Mâer (from the left) take the practice of Karl-Henrich and Ursel rockhouse.
This is also a pleasure for joint citizens Bernd Bormann, economic promotor Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's citizen Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country, doctors - Asendorf, however, have happiness: Dr. Frank Mâer takes the practice of the field houses on 1 October.
Wonderful origin of rock houses goes to the rest, her husband Karl-Henrich sees followers in the next months with a half place to the side.
After a rebuilding phase, Mâer will open the practice again on 12 October until he invests 310000 euros in the spaces at St. Marcellus Street 6.
It was sympathy on the first corner when the rockhouses met Frank Mâer and his wife, Dr. Silvia Mâer-Gongoll, who are currently going to graduate their training in the World Hospital and will also enter into the practice next year.
"We always had in the backhead that the M ́ers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel rockhouse and laughs.
"If it was so far, I just called her."
The couple Mıer's idea to practice his own practice in Asendorf in future.
"The close and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Mâer.
"We want to meet the families over the years."
As a benefit he also sees to be his own boss soon.
And so it was agreed that the Membrans bought the house with practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen Vilsen.
There is also the two-fold family father Frank Mâer wake up, a medical study in Hannover followed in several ariber practices, as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
Currently, he was employed as superior in Sulingen, and he was also assigned to the leading noteart in the circle Depholz in 2009, and is honestly involved in the DRK township Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice is prepared for the new leader.
Since the Chirurg Dr. Karl-Henrich Felstehusen as housear 日, his Gattin Ursel (Internistin) has specialised the gastroenterology.
The Mırs, both internists, want to get down as a home doctor.
"The endoscopy comes out," says 38-year Silvia Mongoll.
After reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more Ultrashall studies and long-term and charge ECGs and need more speaking rooms.
The EDV is completely renewed.
A total amount of EUR 50000 will be obtained in the framework of a programme of support from the country circle (25000 euros), as well as from the community (12500 euros) and the community (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and rejoicing we are that the practice will be continued," states General Deputy Minister Bernd Bormann.
Approximately 2000 patients, according to Silvia Mâter-Gongoll, each quarter comes to the practice of the field houses, in the Northern German average practice, are about 500.
There is another houser practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of practical transmission by Frank Mâer: The Apotheke remains as a result of rock houses in Asendorf.
If no follower had found it, she would have gone too.
In addition, who visits Mõer's speaking hour, continues to look in particular in trusted faces: takes over the seven medical facilities and the cleaning force of the rockhouses.
With their abschied ends an era in Asendorf, the medicals have practiced there for 30 years.
"On the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel seemed to be stumbled.
A little weakness has seen them after a long time.
"But we are still living in Hohenmoor and many patients will be sure too often," says the Internistin.
Your husband laughs: "We have a 6000 square meters base."
"Bisher I've always done before the garden work, now it might be different."
Moreover, the couple has two uncles and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We leave the refugees through"
"Now the border controls will be taken up to our southern border," said Internal Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to it.
It is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum request can also make this "the same understanding".
The provision and security of humans are in front of them.
But, of course, "the fact that it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
People must know that we don't accept unlimited migration streams, nor over the Austrian Slovenian border.
It needed a controlled procedure.
Croatia expected Corridor - Slovenia refused
The Croatian Government had previously informed, Slovenia also wanted to continue to travel to Austria and Germany coming refugees, and also to create corridors for refugees.
However, this internal minister Vesna Györkös Znidar did not see in Laibach.
The idea of Corridors is " absolutely inacceptable", Slovenia will more intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary.
However, Croatia's border is already strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen ra.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenin would not disrupt its limits for refugees.
"Each EU member must comply with its obligations, otherwise the system can't work," stressed Györkos Znidar.
As told by the Croatian Government, the first refugees would have already tried to enter into Eastern Croatia at the border of Tovarnik/Sid to eliminate the registration.
The Croatian police could take her into the nearest meat fields.
According to local media, the Croatian Tovarnik has always met police vehicles with new refugees.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghanistan, including many women and children.
Saving services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country will be calculated with approximately 4000 refugees, said Minister for Interior Ranko Os.
Moreover, buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had yet brought migrations to the Hungarian border, would turn around Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media in the middle-week.
However, the Government decided that it was to show the people to put certain roots: "We can neither do this," he said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with approximately 50 refugees in the Serbian border city Sid would be expected for further buses during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The insects were on the road throughout the night from the Macedonian border around 500 km.
"We have heard that Hungary has come, so the police has told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue traveling to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This would actually actually come to a further west-western part of the movement by observers of the Balkan Route to Turkey-Greece-Mazedonia-Serbia-Serbia.
Croatia: "Inteligent possibilities for border control"
Croatian Internal Minister Oseniuc had previously emphasized that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situation for a strong fluid of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as non-Chengen-Mitglied "total possibilities for border control".
Strengthen controls are carried out to improve the membership in Schengen.
Slovenia belongs to this since 2007, the EU partners have made the country a witness from the way with regard to the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, around 300 refugees continue to stand behind the Hungarian border.
According to media reports, they would have spent last night at the crossing of Horgos, leading to Röszke.
According to Hungarian authorities, the two borders of Horgos and Backi Breg remain locked fully.
If the remaining refugees want to continue to Croatian border, it is still unclean.
The Serbian Internal Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to be at a local appearance in Horgos: he held the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would no longer be a very high refugee number.
You can't say if they would continue their travel over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Help migrants to - Yearly - Alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee assistants have already started to distribute land maps to the refugees in which alternative routes are included by Croatia.
However, the transition between Serbia and Croatia is not unfair: in parts of the border, there are still 20 years after the end of Croatia warfare.
On midnight afternoon, the Croatian police said that a team of mine rooms was sent to the border region.
Bursen-Hacker: Ukrainians live 30 million
Supranonok will have heard of a ring of Cyber criminals, which will be expected to have continued to see financial reports and press reports on sites such as Business Wee, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information provided is to be made on the financial markets for the internal business.
In this way, over 100 million of people were increased by the mediator.
"The present comparison shows that even those outside our country borders will be captured," says the SEC communication.

The staff must have acted both in the United States and in East Europe.
Ecumenic Hospital Aid Manheim is already 20 years old
The Manheimer Paradespace has a government operation.
People do their provisions, partly quick steps, partially humble.
They control the two stars of the Mannheimer Auto Salon on the Paradise.
Keep the town's trains.
Pulsing, pulsing life in a glorious herbs sunlight and with four large tables each with the heading "Before I want to die."...
The ecumenic hospital aid made this action careful to her 20-year-old existence and seems to be confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, therefore we've gone in the middle of the city and among the people," Josephine Lammer says.
The leader of the Ecumenian Hospital Aid is also available to the passengers for questions and conversations as well as the honourable workers.
When some people are spontaneous, a pastant takes to the cross and the term to "seat my life", "read", "keep walking through the camper," "Stop the war" or "not long suffering" at all, keep others standing short, reading, saying seeds like "as far I'm not yet" and then go on.
Once again, small debates about the action, life, trafficking with the dead are developed on the border.
Peter Hübinger is just in the place.
"Only if I make sure that the end of this world comes to me once, I can live responsibility," says the director of the Diaconic Work Mannheim, which is together with the Caritas Group of the Ecumenian Hospital Aid.
Therefore, this public-effective action for 20-year-olds is good.
That not everyone wants to be publicly informed on the tables, however, be understandable, it is a very personal matter.
The theme of death and death is arrested as before with Tabus, so the experience of Josephine Lamb, although just the busy movement in the past years has been a lot to open people.
A appreciation that Angelika shares Godfroid.
The dead and grief membership belongs to the honourable workers of the first hour.
By personal experience confronted with the thee, she read a lot of literature and dismissed to want to be involved in the death aid.
When the Ecumenian Hospital Aid was looking for an appointment of honour, it was immediately reported and attended the establishment in 1995.
Godfroid belongs to a team of 45 honorable - 43 women and two men - the concerned and responsibility in private homes, hospitals, guards and in Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
All of them are carefully trained.
Angelika Godfroid can handle well with its task and experiences and experiences.
"I see life from another waiting, I think it is precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The ambulant ecumenic hospital service boat is free and independent of conference.
Financial support of hospital chassing and S held by members and units allows training and training and supervisions of the members of death and worse.
Every two years training is offered for new workers.
The tables described on Saturday are now published in the house of the Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
More personal desires can be noted on postcards.
FedEx mixed results, low financial perspectives for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supplier guigant reduced his view of winning for a year due to the weakest request for cargo services and costs in the land transport service.
The company also said that it plants about 55,000 season workers for the vacation.
At that time, the last year FedEx announced that the company wanted to set up 500,000 season workers for the vacation.
The action fell over 2.5 Pro in the Premarket trade 45 minutes before the middle-week exemption.
FedEx Corp. said to deserve a win between $10,40 and $10,90 in the business year, which ends in May next, 20 cent less than in the previous predict.
Analystes were expected by a survey of FactSet $ 10,84.
Despite price increases, the lower appearance comes to the average of 4,9 pro­ and will be effective on 4 January and, despite the proposals for land transport of severe and large packages that will be raised from November.
The company said that, however, it expected that the results of the previous year would be increased on account of cost decreases, income income and on account of the growth in the online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred ́ith said that the company "produces solid revenue if weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade."
The vacation employment plans were announced a day later than the rival UPS, which plants 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, including the same number as the last year.
In the quarter, which ended on 31 August, FedEx deserved $692 million, 6 Pro more than in the previous year.
The result per action was $2,42 per action, almost behind $2,44 per action, which asked twelve of Zacks Investment Research.
The turnover increased by 5 Pro to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six of Zacks asked analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has decreased the international priority transmission in the past years, which has made the transmission in its Express unit to stagnize.
But the wood on the online shopping has increased the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover on ground transport increased by 29%, but the operational result was actually flat because of costs for larger packages and self-assurance.
The Express unit decreased income on the basis of prices, while the result of work in the carrier was decreased.
In Premarket trade, approximately a hour before opening, the FedEx acts decrease $3,85, or $2,5 Pro, to $ 150,15.
On Wednesday, they lost 11 Pro for the year and 17 Pro under a record on 11 June.
At its most expected meeting in the year, the Federal Reserve Strategy takes two days this week around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to take the leadership for the first time since almost a year.
A wall image of the United States is over them at the end of the two-modified meeting room.
The map is a reminder that the President-in-Officer Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a double commitment from the Congress: Maximization of US employment and prices are stabil here.
But since the great reception, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too intense to predict it. It is given on Thursday, whether the US business is ready, from the unexamplified incentive that has been dismissed by the short-term rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although the majority of the economy's data shows that they are solid, the youngest turbulences on the global financial markets could make the existing Fed representatives anxious to strengthen this volatility by enhancing the rate of federal loans - and it would be just a quarter of the progress point.
"Obviously the work and inflation will be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economy at the Makerfima Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were on the search for a plan to not add the interest rate, the increased uncertainty is about the global market is sufficient justice to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consciousness of what the feed will do, which prevents the financial in itself.
Approximately the half of the economys, which were recently asked by Bloomberg, have predicted an increase in interest this week.
However, the financial markets expect a waiting for the feed with a key indicator that only shows a 30% opportunity to increase.
This requires a decrease of the action if the feed is added to the set, unless the strategy swallow the sword by promiseing that further increase is far away.
On Wednesday, Dow Jones Industrial average span by 228,89 points or by 1.4% at 16.599,85.
The action was issued by expectations that the Federal Policy keeps the seat in this week, said John Lonski, the Chef of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would take the seat at this time," he said.
If she does, " she should go very far in her clothes to relax the financial markets so that they should not be panic."
Other experts argued that an increase of interest would deteriorate the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty of the feed.
Another month ago, the feed appeared to increase the set of 0.25 percent points in this month, the first small step in a slow deterioration of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen said in the early and breakfast that, despite the complaints of Liberals, in this year, that more economic progress would be needed to expect an increase in the settlement.
Although the creation of jobs was slow in August, the improvement in work was solid in this year.
The unemployment rate was decreased to 5.1% in the past month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the feed views as full employment.
Loan increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although the inflation remained under the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Federal representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices.
The economy "perhaps decreasing price rates and breaching it because of the stress on the work," said Ian Shepherdson, Chefökonom at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the finance markets in the whole world were shocked together last months after China had evaluated his bill.
The average value of Dow Jones Industrial was more than 16% under its maximum level in May, when investors threatened that a slowness of the Chinese economy would distort the global growth.
The market has recovered something in this month, and the Dow is now about 10% under the top of May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulences affect the complex calculation to increase the rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weaknesses of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would take the shoes at this meeting," Stephen D. Ol日, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and an ancient worker of the US notes bank.
Now he says that it will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economies will be, and there are almost no confidential data that describe the developments in China," said Ol.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main approaches of the Fed, therefore they should not be involved technically in their decision-making.
But at the end of the end, the Fed Whee has become the world's members.
The impact of the Central Bank was enormous in the last years.
The only indication of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the feed can "unified" its monetary expansion, solved confusions around the globus.
In a world where markets and economics continue to be cursed, the Federal representatives can expect them to monitor not only the developments in other places but also consult other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Your decision finding is "better art than Property", said Zachary Karabell, leader of the global power management of the company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a story of overreactions to financial movements which appear not to be linked to the economic based data."
Lacker, a voted member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which is used for an increase of interest, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia decreased the Fed to reduce its guidelines by 0.75 pro-points at three meetings, "in spite of limited impact on growth in the United States", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives rejected these reductions.
The Fed should set the aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market combined in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England.
The youngest turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"It certainly doesn't want to go into the situation where she has a price increase, because the markets are rising up," said the President of Peterson Institute for International Economic.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not affect the financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think it should be forwarded the time.

Brazil’s pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes Ernäh ♫ for healthy tissues
The Brazilian Children Organization tries to shockingly show women how important it is to eat during the breakfast. She does this with the presentation of images of babys that are swimming to breasts that are incorporated with presentations of healthy foods.
Mother milk consists of a number of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbonhydrates that give baby all foods needed to build a strong immune system.
As a result of the additional energy requests, pregnancy and young mothers will be advised to increase their daily calories for approximately 500 calories per day.
However, new research results indicate that a strict calories import is not the only dietetic adjustment that the mothers should take.
A current employment under the leading of Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy nutrition of pregnant women actually relates to the genes of their baby and shalt it before the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy nutrition of the child may affect the immune system negatively.
Exceptions for the new Bern’s sportshall
The Communicated Bern ́ approved the building rate for EUR 2.3 million.
And he made an exception.
The cup can be flashed for solar layout.
The planning for the long-term tournament building at the Bern’s sportsmans is a step forward: at the latest community meeting, the exhausted building rate has been completely blessed without great discussions.
Previously, the committee, among others, had proposed another request for a constructive "exemption" respectively "free" from the valid conservation plan.
The "exception" was the authorisation for a special form regarding the construction of the dach.
Thereafter, a "Satteldach with non-mediate first and dach range" will be created.
The background of the planning is the intended use of the solar planning area: "We get a wonderful southern dach together", said citizen Joseph Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "free" was again about the covering that would be written for energy reasons other than in the building plan.
The volume of the hall is clearly reduced.
It was therefore necessary to "free" because the preservation plan does not allow "exceptions" - whereas the Bern's community normally is more restrictive for freedom applications.
However, the tournamental building is not a further project: "We do not make any case of presence", as Steigenberger.
The tournamental building at sport area is a Community project of the community and the SV Bern.
Costs are calculated about 2.3 million euros.
Countries are expected by the promotion of school and broadports.
In the next phase of procedure, the building rate for the 18 x 36 meters of large hall will now be presented to the Agricultural Council for the exam.
Clinic Peißenberg goes to Schongau
The hospital Pitzenberg is to be closed earlier than planned, namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will be a new director at the Hospital Schongau.
The station and the majority of the employees are moved from Pitzenberg to Schongau.
This is the surprising plans of the Hospital House, 1992, of the country's circuit, visited by the farmer Andrea Jochner white.
However, a decision shall be taken by the Supervisory Board, which shall come on midnight, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Pitzenberg would continue to work.
The major majority of the fishermen and the remaining internal station are to turn to Shongau.
The rooms are available.
The workers who are not able to go to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim, such as Jochner-white.
The employees are informed of the plans.
Outgel gear has changed the cancellation of Dr. Andreas Eder, which is first since the beginning of the year, its director of the Schongauer Clinic, and now changes to a practice in directer near the hospital.
On the question who would follow, Jochner-white, the name "fisher" came into the game that was ready to take the lead from 1 October and change with team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means, in any case, a "valuation" and an extension of the "Intere Medicine", such as Jochner white.
Fisher is a specialist for heart stepmakers and defibrillators.
Shongau (180 beds) is specialized at the internal station on gastroenterological diseases.
Periodically for the next two years, fishermen with a team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, lead both homes, until the next year the former hospital of the bottle, which is still more than 35 beds, will be closed in Peißenberg after nearly 140 years.
The country circle had planned this for 2018 when the currently running sanction at the hospital Weilheim has been completed.
Landrutin Jochner white, also president of the Supervisory Board, was found in order to enjoy the house in the owner of the band's buttons futurely as a residence for asyl weapons.
"I'm exiting this." As it continues with the immobility, Jochner-white couldn't say that there were several considerations.
Currently, there is a short time schedule of Caritas and a daily psychiatric.
"What better couldn't help us, such a opportunity will not come again," so fisher over the Quasi-transfer to the lake that was taken by the employees "true and very comprehensive".
A real perspective for the house in which the fisher has been over 30 years as Chefar.
He was requested by Schongauer colleagues to receive the posts of the director's officer.
The hospital Peitenberg (only 100 beds) was always threatened to shut down in the past years, departments were closed, for example the surgery and birth aid.
The handballs of the Rhein-Neckar Lions are requested tonight (20.15 hours) at the HC mountain.
The table leader of the Federal Legislation is in Wuppertal the clear favorite, but there is no one.
At the past season, the bathrooms at BHC have a painful delay and have something to do in it.

Even more refugees are looking for a payable stay.
The pressure on the apartment.
The social housing building is a challenge.

To cover the request for payable apartments, 400,000 new units should be built until 2020.
This is the result of a committee in the "Social Apartment Building" committee.
For example, this year, 260,000 units are completed in Germany.
That's what 140,000 apartments missed.
Refugees are no longer obligation to live in the first three months of their stay as asylum seeker.
Then they went on the apartments and entered into the long serpents before the households.
However, according to the Statistical Federal Agency last year, less than the help of all asylum applicants lived in the midst of the year.
However, the negative development of the apartment is not only the increased escape numbers.
It also constitutes significant deficiencies in the building policy of the last years.
Germany offers a apartment department before itself, which grows from year to year.
Currently there were some 770,000 residence units in the balling areas, complained by Matthias Günther, author of the Others.
Practical employees therefore lived in large towns in WG rooms.
Young wake up because of the flout on the apartment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the largest cities, the number of square metres per head has been renewed in the past years.
To solve the problem, the "Social Apartment Building" covenant proposes a restart.
In this context, new incentives are to rebuild the social housing building.
This could be decreased on the basic acquisition tax, and the basic taxes for promoted apartments could be expired periodically.
In addition, according to the covenant, attractive tax abbreviation options are needed.
The support programme for refugees of the state bank KfW is now well in cities and communities.
One week after the beginning, 184 million euros had already been received on Montagaged with more than the half of around 300 million euros available.
The project could even be suspended now.
Refugees have free lead: Croatia and Slovenia are adjusting Corridor
After Hungary, there is practically no longer a transition, where more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant transit through Slovenia to north without shores.
However, it is dangerous.
Croatia wants to understand with neighborland Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Internal Minister, and if it is necessary, we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Internal Minister Ranko OsÕic.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone.
Croatia is not a Schengen country yet.
After the conclusion of the Serbian-Hungary border, hundreds of refugees have been dropped to Croatia to get to West Europe from there.
500 people have reached the border to Tovarnik, reported by the Croatian TV RTL.
Hungary had cut off his border on the morning for refugees.
Moreover, new laws that entered into force on the same day make regular asyl procedures practically overflow in Hungary.
Croatia wants the refugees to make.
The Croatian President Zoran Milanovic explained: "You can travel through, and we prepare ourselves for this."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and get something.
However, there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU neighborland Croatia tomorrow.
According to the majority of the media reports, Iran and Afghanistan are reported.
They came both with the bus and taxes to the Serbian border city Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia over the green border.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, however, the refugees did not stand on the border sea.
This is why the border lines are other: there are still scarce mines from the Yugoslav citizen war in the 1990s.
Miner spaces are to make a safe passport quickly.
To Hungary, no more refugees will come after the border is closed.
On Wednesday, the police numbered 366 attacked people.
Shortly before the morning on Monday, there were 9380.
The new Hungarian laws include the overcome and damage of the border area as a criminal.
Therefore, 35 criminal procedures were initiated in the Southern border city Szeged.
The convicted men threaten arrest penalties to up to five years and the exemption from the country.
According to the emigrants, on Sunday, the new transsessions set up at the border were 94 asylum requests, of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of Röszke.
Among the applicants 13 families with small children and two older people.
At midnight, 40 refugees would have stopped there.
However, practically no one has a view to get asyl in Hungary.
According to Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum applicants are to be cut there.
Before the "Transesone" in Röške, only a few hundred refugees were gathered.
In Röške, workers started to clean with them.
They gathered the M., who left the ten thousand people last weeks on the road border.
Blocks were destructed and one of the recording camps was rebuilt in the border.
For the purpose of this construction, no one wanted to express himself.
Austria is only a few refugees in Serbia and Hungary after closing the border.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
Some 20 000 migrants remained in the country after governments.
In Salzburg, approximately 1400 people were waiting for further transport to Germany.
Transport from there to Germany was arrested on the morning on the order of German authorities.
In free release, smaller groups of refugees regularly met to foot.
Citizen Master passed "Grandete" over the border
"We were occupied with the cleaning after the breakfast on Sunday as suddenly people with travel sacrifices at the entrance of the tabernacle," as warrior Warnstein's citizen Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted the train to Passau.
Since Germany had made a surprise for her in Wernstein Schlluss on Sunday, but because of the fleeting stream, the road transport with Austria was used for her in Wernstein Schlluss," so Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the trands together with two other helpers and their cars over the border to the Near Passau.
Earlier, we have made the unexpected guests available with jause and drinks.
We just said we'd bring them to Passau with the car.
"It was self-comprehensive for us," so Stadler in OÖN talk.
You were very thankful.
A man didn't let it take a great spending - 100 euros for the firewall.
"It's a great pleasure for us," so Stadler.
On Sunday, the travel passengers were increased by a ICE in a regional movement to pasau, so that after the short-term announcement it was made that the road transport was installed to Germany, but still trying over the border.
However, the regional train was released before the border in Wernstein.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The Brücken festival related to the Bayer neighbors on Sunday, on the first day a two-break sporting course - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from New Church.
That Viktor Orbán now sends more ten thousands to us is a logical result of a seeming:
Instead of helping in the Lager Röszke immediately in creating structures to ensure humanity, our Federal Cancer has highly and publicly emphasized the position of the Hungarian Government in the dust circle of national socialism.
Sadly, this is not only the Austrians who are now in front of the frontiers with chaotic conditions.
The refugees will also have to find out that the "ground country", which it has invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a big challenge to make human conditions for protectors with regard to the continuing fleeting streams and the nearby winter.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Conrad on search for 35.000 winter-fested quarters
Conrad has all hands filled with the delivery of refugees.
Christian Konrad is usually used to weigh his word.
The Government has used the earlier powerful raifeisen bank to build quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first collection of the Traiskirchens has already reached Konrad.
"We don't have any obdachless anymore in traiskis," he reported of the first success.
In addition, the transfer of the 200,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday had been performed without a large furnace, Konrad said and praised the organizational "master force".
However, the Ministry of Interior has spoken of a "crising situation".
Total Conrad calculates with a need of 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to fulfil the number, 35,000 visits must be found in the next week - 20,000 countries are to provide, 15,000 of the Federation.
If there's more refugees, we can do it.
"But there's no fashion without ground," Conrad said.
He has already spoken with the heads of the country.
They would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees.
"In the top of the kingdom it's good," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Kardinal Christoph Schönborn, to be cleared how the church will help.
Great expectations are also placed in the ORF "Help like us".
On the platform, persons can offer uncomplicated accommodations.
Also, you hope for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Conrad and Maier criticized the standards for submission last night as "very high".
In emergency times it may not be that the quarter providers must keep a certain height of the handholder or size of the upper lights.
"Not Standards" must be applied for a time-term.
In contrast to the Ministry of Internal Services, the Conrad's experience has been founded.
I am an older Lord, who is not speaking the uncertainty without any other way.
Convincing power is his main weapon.
Conrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs, as they claimed themselves.
Your number of employees wants to add to three to four.
The own quarter search was not yet.
Konrad wanted to build a container at Stephans' place as a office.
However, there are evident problems with the approval.
Linz requires a better distribution
First, there is no opening of urban sportshalls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for the delivery of refugees.
This is not needed at the moment, since it is possible to take the concerned without these measures, Mr Claus Luger (SP).
However, for the need, further places are to be examined on their property.
The city head is critical in the division of refugees within the Federal Country.
In addition, other areas have to contribute here.
Seahofer: "The borders are not discharged"
In a longer phone with the Bayer president Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Püringer (VP) agreed on Monday the next action in the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not discharged.
The continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are just the relevant border controls.
Specifically with refugees to Germany will no longer exist.
However, protectors would be brought to Germany with regular movements.
Of the other EU Member States, efforts have been requested once again to strengthen solidarity in the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria is also implementing controls at its borders is "a logical follow-up" for the Pyrringers from the Germans' procedure.
The next onetastic is a question of time
The general advancement of the "New Werft" in the Linzer Industrial Industrie is officially completed.
In four of the six Stockworks of the office and production building, the IT-notated S&T-concern is included, which will be removed to young, innovative undertakings from the technology area.
"In the IT the smart heads are our basic substance - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T-Chefe Hannes Nederhauser.
He can imagine investing in startup companies of the New Werft and later accommodating what.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - what Nederhauser promises: "The next is a question of time."
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T to the location, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to a third part of the city of Linz, the country of Upperreich and the FFG.
The building has been forgotten by Linz AG for 60 years at S&T and Techcenter.
30 Pro of the 2700 square metres area in the building are already located, for more 40 Pro.
Lia-Peroni-inhaber opened the second business in the Arcade
In the new shop, Furla hands are in the middle.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to make a dog.
The 49-year-old inheritant of Lia Peroni had to move up shortly in the baptism arcade: Sō has now grown up in another business.
In the furla-shop against the business where it is purchased, including coffee, coffee, shoes and wheat of various producers, everything is now about the lady hands of the mark Furla, money buckets are 75 euros.
The larger bags and accessories cost up to EUR 500.
Since yesterday, the new shop is in operation.
A few weeks ago, it was rebuild.
"But I've long been thinking if I should open another load," he says.
Exhaustively, for the decision, it was, among other things, that the Furla products that are in Bologna at home were also made by the idea of a own place where only their hands were packed.
"We are the only ones in the large room of Linz who make this mark cross," says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots.
Her interest has been width of her mother in the wheat.
I'm most likely when something is developing and I can show new trends to be admissible.
Why some women do not respond with the latest security when they look at a beautiful pack in dealing, even the physician can't answer.
Perhaps it is that a beautiful box will evaluate every outfit.
The wedding master from the calltown
The Phallers of Donald Trump came from a place whose residents are called.
This property also connects some to the billion who wants to be the US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for upholders.
Whether he speaks strangely, journalists are delighted or revealing happiness in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the Office of the U.S. Chairpersons will strive the election battle.
And cut it well out.
This is also registered in the PAAL Call City, where the mains of the immobiliary mi are coming.
The New Yorker with the fencefriend is a concept of many in the Winzerdorf on the wine street.
Some in the 1200 inhabitants' place are associated with him over -60 corners.
His grandfather came from the call city in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the choice mode.
The callman Simone Wendel turned a movie over Trump.
And what do the villages think about his goal to become the most powerful man of the world?
"I think that they find it somehow exciting, but they do not be so impressed in their calling city kind," said Simone Wendel.
The birthday callholder has turned a wonderful documentary film on the location and its famous speakers, to whom the Ke’up family Heinz is also counted near Trump.
Trump, which is not for modesty, also comes in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) as a word - so with the statement that he would also be safe if he lived in the call city.
He didn't bring it to the king of the hearts.
If it gives respect for the performance of the family, but also tendencyfully the opinion that Trump is "a little big mouth", Wendel says.
The name of the town in the surrounding area, "The weddingmaker" - to the Hochdeutsch, says she.
Thus Trump comes from the village of the eggs.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold to the United States.
The foundation of the immobility concern was the first basic sales in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragic: their desire to keep back to the house was departed from the Bayer State where the Pfalz belonged at that time.
He didn't take Trump because he had been detained without authorization, the director of the Institute for False History and Population, Roland Paul, had explained to the movie start.
Trump is the uncle of an illegal immigrant.
This is in contrast with the marking statements of the follower.
He repeatedly spoke of mexican immigrants in the United States and requested the building of a border wall to scare illegal immigrants.
"It's not so sympathic as the polter," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote family Trumps ("The grandfather was a born tromp, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The winner in the rest sees the Americans more distant, "He's always so exciting."
Does he think Trump is coming?
"I can't imagine that," says 72-year-old.
"He never cared about the call city."
The Pensionshertin Veronica Schramm, like some calltowns, learned that a family of Heinz at an eyewitness spent something for the Church Orgel, which was generally good.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
They feel better if he doesn't win the choice, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if it's good."
If those who had the statement in the days of his grandfather in the United States were like him, "if he never arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than he," says Winzer daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as the president?
"My President isn't," she said.
And, "The trumpets will also be reef without the President Trump."
Wendels film, long interviewed for the Trump, have seen 12 000 films, even in the United States interest.
The Oberbayerian community Ramsau at Berchtsgaden is first "Bergstigerdorf".
From the hand of the Vice-President at the German Alpenveren, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the National Park of Berchtsgaden received the exhibition for a fine tourism.
In Austria, there are already 20 "groundstorms".
In the neighborhood, the Alpenverein is responsible for the grant of the exhibition.
A "grouperdorf" may have at least 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its surface must be assigned as a protection area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the evaluations, despite the trials of Nine, to take the loss of leadership at today's show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are going to Canberra to report the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but there has not been a great movement in the reviews for today.
The breakfast show of Nine was stretched by the Federal City when Malcolm Turnbull made the torch of Tony Abbott.
The Rival Sunrise, with the modernists David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a weekly series of international television sentences, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This decline of the distance seemed not to play a role for australian TV surveys, since sunrise had average 397.000 viewers at the five main cities, compared to today 339.000.
Today has easily achieved an increase in the ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Sunday (283.000), but his number remained behind the last Thursday (343.000).
Today has closed the lock to Sunrise in the past months.
In August, a average of 318.000 people reached today in comparison with the 330,000 Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance passed between 400,000 and 500,000.
So far in September Sunrise has average 349.000 viewers to 314.000 today.
This is the most interesting thing that makes every morning.
The winds of the change relate to these morning springs more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thank you for checking!

The great news for Seven was the impressioning debt of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Mystery enth? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have uncertainly seen who wins The Bachelor.
The woman that landed at the Sam Wood in the Bachelors was held in greater secret.
And no one of the three remaining girls will certainly be priced whether she is the one who has received the last rose.
But when we checked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before they become from three, you may have probably given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips firm until the end of Thursday
All three women have expressed themselves in the light of the reasons why Wood is the perfect man and call his sense of humor, honesty, family values and positive attitude as a reason why they want to be his partner.
Yet, if the question is asked "If you don't, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers to the player could become who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both called quickly - outside themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have made a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went to the house and noticed (Sarahas) and Sam's energy, I realized that they were quite compatible, and I thought that in the whole history of the show," said Jeavons Fellows.
"Saraah stands with two feet on earth, it makes it so fun to be with her," adds Markoski.
I saw her together, and they have the right chemical.
They feel pleasant and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay believes that they and Sam Wood would be well suitable as a couple.
From her view Mackay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood could be "the One".
"When I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game -- I'm now unreserved on him," she said.
And when she was asked, who would choose the wood, unless she was, it was grievous.
"I don't know if I can tell it," she said.
I love the rest of the girls at the same time - it's an unexpected difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is stretched on the midweek, 19:30, on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL kare.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in the movement to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent questions on the end of the last year after printing open training day.
But Hayne chose the 49ers of San Francisco and Tra's Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a smart decision.
Some trees would have been forbidden by Hayne for the game to the bank when he lost a garage as did the Commission-Rugby Liga converter at first point return on Tuesday at 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also in the current game after a hurt of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the clock cabin after the game.
Instead of smoking his fuckings before the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula strengthened Hayne also publicly at his press conference after the game.
The 49th Sport reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGhey, who wants him to forget his broken fish and to care for the next game.
Jarryd Hayne pat日 at a point that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the beginning that Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up had hoped for his NFL debt.
Hayne left the game field after the fumble and later told the Australian Duo Hamish & Andy radio on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine the worst start in his NFL kare,
"It was a thing that happens now, you only care about the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the bridge with Origin Debout at that time in 2007, when a passport in its own in-goal area led to a tri for Queensland.
However, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne placed for a photo with fans and holds a Australian flag after the game and posts it on instagram.

The free choosers request the position of 1000 new teachers in Bayern because of the high refugee numbers.
Partie and Group Chairman Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW's heritage clause in Great Walltown before a serious crisis at Bayern's schools, when there is no new teacher in respect of many new teachers: "We need at least 1000 associated teachers to keep schools from the collaps," said Aiwanger.
"On the other hand, we'll get forgotten in the Bayer educational system."
The country party of the Free Electors will take place until Friday in the sub-France community.
In fact, other main topics were intended.
But the number of refugees is now dominated by the free chooser meetings.
"Surely, the theme Asyl will overload the clausur," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger requested the establishment of UN shot zones for refugees, as was given during the Yugoslavia war in the nine years.
"It's not the way, we have to make the causes," said the Free Elector Chief.
Rejected asylum applicants want the free choosers to cut off as quickly as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also requested more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW Chairman criticized that several federal countries were not consequent: "We need a community standards of the Federal Countries."
"Bayers go away, others don't."
"There we must be more negotiable."
However, the country policy in the Great-Wall town should not fall under the table.
A yearly long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For a new school year, Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot trial "Medium level plus" at 47 Gymnasium, where an extension of the gymnasial average of three to four years is tested - in the result it takes again nine years to the Abitur.
But this doesn't go far enough.
"The theme G9 must be accelerated," said FW Chief.
We ask freedom of choice for all the Gymnasiums who want it.
Free travel at G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after the police shot guummichoss on demonstrants in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in the south Nepal after the police shot in a quantity of people who demonstrated the new constitution, a officer said the middle-week.
Violence on the day of service in Rupandehi District, about 175 miles west from the main city of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, leader of the district, said that more than 1,000 demonstrants had gathered outside a police station, and some of you threw stones and brand bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police had used the gas and then shot into the air before it came back to the rubber.
20 police officers and five civilians were hurt, he said.
It was not soon clear why the rubber used, of which they could kill, but traditionally used as less mortal alternatives, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The discharge was the last weeks of violent acting protests in Nepal southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of Maddesi say that new provinces which are designed under the proposed new Constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who wanted a own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent disruptions since 10 years.
August murdered when the four large political parties undertaken an agreement to share the country in provinces - a important step towards a new Constitution, but a very conflicting topic in Nepal, which has been governed in centuries.
The work on a new Constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the laws have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the Constitutional draft in Kathmandu, and officers said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Planned building area in the city
The basic piece at Emder Young ̈rum Old Post is to be rebuilt.
The city presently prepares everything for the 4000-quadrameter surface.
Planned is a mixture of trade, accommodation and residence - concrete ships are still not available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to deploy a 4000 square meters of a large foundation in direct neighborhood to the youth's old post.
Preparations are currently running.
It is planned to use the territory for a mixture of trade, accommodation and housing.
You're waiting for a corresponding boat, which is the side of the city.
Which investor is asked is not clear yet.
No contracts have been concluded in accordance with it.
The city of Emden had a part of the foundation that is located on the road / Angle Great Street, cooked a few months ago and allowed the buildings to be cut off.
Project Hive: Details on the table
The plans for vacation at the small sea in Emden are adopted.
The investor first presented public plans for the project.
Some anxieties are continued to be difficult - they're demanding the exemption of their free time.
For months after closed doors, it was negotiated, buried, debated and opened.
Now the plans for a new holiday at the Small Sea are near Emden on the table.
The interested one, the Mediterranean Emder Company "System-Bau", presented its plans for the first time at Montaguesd in the City Development Committee of Emder Council.
This point was originally on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP group, which prejudiced the investor and the administration of secretism, Ralf Behrends from the system-building business guide to Offensive: "We have no answer to all questions," he said before the members of the Council and over 50.
But it's good to meet all the resources now.
It has been discussed for months about ≥ 12 million euros.
Heavy reactions among maritime owners who had come to the meeting were called out the pictures and new details for the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, marine owner and member of the representation of the Aneuters, Pro Hieve, claims: "This will be a rice crowd that will overcome all other buildings."
Moreover, he fears, as some other project criticians, that the vere would be strong by the intended size of the installation: "They must come all bus loads in order to calculate it," so Schulz
What happens exactly on the good hectare a large area of the former guests is still open.
There's no driver yet.
"We must first have presented a decisive concept," Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the building plans are still variable.

NHC provides 60 percent opportunity for cyclon south of the Capverd Islands
The United States National Urricane Centre said on Sunday a wide deep pressure system of approximately 350 miles southern from the southern Capverd Islands, which has a 60 percent chance to develop to a tropical furnace in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined depth pressure system, such as the middle of the Capverd Islands and the small Antilles, also has a 60-percent potential to form a tropical storm in the next two days, are the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts double-scale campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double-scale campaign that would offer 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrolled the European N° because they flee from the war scattered and poor countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach to announce the call on the blog.
Instead of a manager to make an announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google partner who is with her family from Kabul, when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"To our journeys belonged many dark travelers and bus carriers, as well as hunger, dust, colds and rust," she wrote.
I had lucky.
But since the refuge and migration crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are trying to find help.
The S° is available to four useful organizations that provide assistance for refugees and migrants: doctors without border, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for refugees.
Google said that the first global shop collected up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugee rent will be duplicated to 11 million dollars.
Europe has been confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year citizen war that has destroyed more than 4 million people this year.
Flights also fled from Afghanistan, Jemen, Iraq and Libya destroyed by the war.
Report of Yasmeen Abutaleb; Christian Pı
For light overweight diabetes, weight loss surgery may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for light overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new range.
It is too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes live after weight loss chirurgy longer than those receiving non-chirurgical treatments.
"The death data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a expert of weight loss surgery, who wrote a leadership to the new area in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss-opera or Adi ́as surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the magnesium.
They reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to get up.
Over the years, Adi ́as-Oper has shown the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficate, but most of them have been carried out in people who are illly ill with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or 35.
BMI, a certain weight measure in respect of size, is applicable as normal between 18,5 and 24,9.
A 25 or more BMI shows that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI more than 30 are considered fatal.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new areas, researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital data that they have collected in a range since 2007 and compared two types of Adi ́as chirurgy - magenbypass and magen-shooking training - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweighty.
The average BMI among those under this operation was decreased from 31 to 24,5 to the end of the fifth year.
In the meantime, the BMI remained in those who received non-chirurgical diabetes treatments immediately at 29.
Among those who were involved in a chirurgical attack, the diabetes disease was totally resolved in 36% and in 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, the diabetes solved totally only in a pro and partially in about two pro.
Furthermore, the results of blood pressure controls, triglyceride and the "worst" LDL cholesterin "in general better in the "chirurgical" group" were found by the authors.
The researchers also monitor the blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar values during the time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best maintained under 7 Pro, write the researchers.
After the operation, the average haemoglobin A1c level of around 9 Pro to around 6 Pro.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at approximately 8 Pro.
But this better "glykemic control" - as you reflect in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce death in five years, so the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares average results to the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass chirurgy group, compared to the gastrektomy group, had increased weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), increased BMI returns (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 % to 2.1 %) and had added a complete overcome of diabetes (46.9 % to 16.7 %).
Since the new Property does not show the survival of the survival of the survival surgery after five years, there are indications from a very difficulter people in Sweden that the operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the Arena College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish, there was a deceived people who were subject to an Adi ́as operation, about 29% less likely to die during 15 years -- compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new area has shown no benefit for survival in the surgery patients, Blackstone said that it is comforting for persons with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this Property because she says that this operation in this BMI group is lower," she said without an increased risk of death or renal disease.
Blackstone suggests that people and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously, immediately the patient with BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously," she said.
I think soon they have gathered these genetic changes that have closed their body with fattyness and diabetes, it is really difficult to replace."
Love History Plays in Hunspress
It is a subject that currently increases attention in the Belletistics: a young woman, in school times unbelief and unnecessary, takes back the warmth of her youth after years, and this is confident of her.

"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot take all refugees, Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Near East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to stop the violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama stated the problem of the sustainable refuge crisis at the beginning of his daily search in the United Kingdom in his speech on the exhibition of Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethical studies.
He requested that the interests of humanity should be placed in the circumstances given in front of the interests of individual N° or even continents.
He also emphasized that the reaction of the Western countries to the refugee crisis was not worthwhile, but the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama Germany and Austria's efforts to promote the crisis, he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution.
"Seeing for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you must think of long-term solutions, such as a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these muslim countries," he emphasized.
We need to consider how the killing is reduced in their countries.
We must reduce the use of violence.
"The application of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September and showed that the violenceous reaction of the United States moved a category of uncontrolled events.
After the 11th September, I held my attendance in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in unsility.
"I know that his motives were good, but he imposed violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the administration of hand-defectives in children in the past 4 years
Gift control in the United States reports a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years that cause strong alcoholic infections, as the Georgia Poison Centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia Poison Center, the cases of intake of hand-infections in children under 12 years, reporting gift controls, increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"The children are always more frequent to these products, and, unfortunately, a pro-seed of them is going to the need," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink defectives carefully while some do it to impress their friends or because of a temptation of the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how youth defectives drink only because of a pleasant experience.
Youths have seemed to have mixed defectives with alcoholic water in order to get a worse drink.
Scientists can be locked by attractive depths of defectives.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
The attracted (hand-defectives) are those who are parfumed.
There are defectives with earthly beer, wine and orange dust that are very responsible for children.
Manual infections contain somewhere between 45 and 95 Pro alkohol.
Besides in small children, few sprinters can lead to alcohol disturbance.
"It's the highest council of alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, the medical director of the chamber at the University of Kansas, the sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So you wouldn't let the whisky stand up, but people leave this hand-defective medicine in riches of children, and when children come to it, it's a quick opportunity to consume much alcohol.
Nhaiyah, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four sprinters of a hand-infection in the school, was brought into a need for treatment.
Her blood alcohol convergence was 179, twice as the swell, which is legally used to be drinked in a grown, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, a notebook-Ar, which treated her in Gwinnett Medical Centre outside Atlanta.
Nhaiah laughed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the need.
Doctors watched them at night in a separate child hospital on signs of brain-trauma, since the girl was fallen through the alcohol and had shot the head, said Ritchey.
"It was very terrifying," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaiyah's mother, CNN.
It could have been dead for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcoholless products or defects and to store hand infections outside the richest of the child.
In addition to alcohol disturbance, some defectives were associated with death cases.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after the slaughter of hand-defectives, which had a toxic, non-sufficient suit.
Workers of health staff believe that the product contained methanol, a mortal solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was noted as active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in New York planned to defeat their "general" teacher by exposing antibacterial products around the educational room," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic against hand-infections and exited her out of her room.
The police viewed the simplified plan as a "black" and referenced disciplinary measures to the school member.

The lack of title competition in Scotch football long-term Netherlands - the farm
The former Rangers Mediterranean player and former national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that the Netherlands football fans have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title-reality with the rangers.
The Boer, now a newsman for Ajax, said, "In Holland, they do not show the top points of the Celtic Games anymore and why?"
It's because the rangers are not there.
People here are not just talking about the back of the rangers.
They're talking about the old company.
They're talking about both teams together and that's what they're interesting.
There is a lot of spending in the Old Business Games, and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn the things around, swear Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian head swore to turn things.
After the delay against Malmou and the following separation from the Champions League, the decline against 10 men from Aberdeen, now with five points forward, was clear at the top of the table.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will return."
Now we want to get out there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very wretched or trist about what's done.
We feel exactly that - but we have to continue.
We really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players better.
Now, it is so important to stay together.
Warburton carefully on January Transfers
Despite his comments only a few weeks ago, which suggested that he had taken some of the translations of January, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new access and maintaining that he does not want to shalt the unit of the Ibrox-Caders.
The former chief of Brentford said, "The January-Transfer window is very different from the Sommer-Window."
The players coming in the summer have this pre-session time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The manship is really good.
Sometimes more damage is created by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic destination person Michu with backtrace notice

McInnes said, "There is no man who has won everything in pokal games or lips that haven't even won the games of this kind."
Worklessness in Scotland remains unchanged while it grows in total in the United Kingdom.
The unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164.000 in May to July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5,9 Pro > was over the UK of 5,5 Pro, as showed the numbers of the National Statistics Office.

A 28-year-old man had 2.15 Promille and remained in the guard.
Why I will be a Witness of an execution in Oklahoma
Something later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man will be brought to death.
If it happens, and I hope that it doesn't happen, I'll be in a viewer gallery in the death room in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the bridge.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at death.
The invitation was already made in January about his best friend, and though I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day was nearer, I began to be afraid.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be an opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see events in the United States, and since more applications are often available than the sites, there is a good lottery place to decide who is selected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will watch it emotionally.
I can't.
I will sit near Richard Glossips, a close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship during the months with telephones and a two or a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison auditors say that I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to stay with a notebook and a pipe to get up to what I see.
I just have to try to remind me of all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to abandon my independence.
Here's the lection.
Tell the story of prison as he wants, and you get access.
I'm sorry with her.
She realized that "he could better formulate," but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would.
I told him he could remove me from his list of Witnesses at any time.
But he wants a international reporter to write there.
When he grows, he thinks that the public work of the movement against death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a recorder of Huffington Post, will sit near me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of Podcasts I did.
I don't want to go here again to all the details.
I can't safely say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the fact.
But I think there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe that there is no sufficient evidence to justifie a death sentence.
I think his fixation is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters that you can turn to.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die in need of death.
Man convinced to come from the Canning River after a fair police persecution jack
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he convinced the man from the Canning River.
An attempt of a man from Perth to devote the police was unfair when he was in the low and sucking water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "remember her softly to guard her back to the coast."
The police of Canning Vale was called on Tuesday to a home-free break-out accident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them in direction of Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I don't come out, come and take me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too pleased to make his uniform nose, so he turned a more reliable tactic to - "A good policeman negotiated".
"Thus times people do pleasant things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Mastership Football Player Ben Cousins provides an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins took his car into the graves to escape a alcohol control and then tried to flee over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired inhabitants to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spion him and threatened to end the rainsport
Peter Moody claims that Stewards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spion in his places last year and threatened to quit the run immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had conducted a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late scratching because of a retirement treatment, the last power halm on midweek.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the Rennesport and he felt himself under difficult conditions when it went to the positive cobalt baptism sample at Lidaris that he could not declare.
He had stopped 18 months because of the spionage prejudices and didn't want it to look like too hanging tubes.
"I had to say nothing about it, and I sat long on it, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to handle the high head, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying for her.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, I shouldn't be a tragedy anymore.
Then I have to consider what I'm doing with my licence.
Before Moody had allowed the bomb to get up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had attempted to spion his stall.
"Eight months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I will call when I'm asked - and offer him a job in my places to provide information about what I'm doing within my places," said Moody on Racing.com.
You're obviously thinking I'm an injury.
If that is the case, they should certainly take their nose because they have denied me at trying to take me away.
Robert Roulston, formerly. President of the RVL, David Moodie, official President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, was aware of it at the time and are still today.
Should that lead me to the view that it will be personal?
Has the RVL behaved fairly and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what is happening in the branch?
I'm bad for the branch?
I'm so bad for the branch?
Maybe people think that I am.
Maybe they have to take my license and kill me, and I don't doubt that what I say, let her think about now.
But I'm now at the point where I don't care about it, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will exercise the pressure on them and force them to make a decision.
I have my family support and I can go.
The frustration level of the tray has been built with the long-term cobalt research in Lidari, and the Late Scratching has led to saying that he can throw his licence over the table.
Moody, in the best way by preparing his insulted master Black Caviar, covered the Rennday treatment rule "smiley", after a packaging was opened on the horse bones, what was contrary to the rules.
"It's against the rules of the rental.
I must take the full responsibility for it," he said.
"It's unfortunately opened my employees a flame on my leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could be the whole day yesterday, whatever it was.
But it was like that on Friday.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the packaging on the round day. A study of this matter was opened.
It's a shit.
People who set up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you've gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after the flight
The police arrested a man on the weekend after a concert with a railway driver and then a carrier in Cobram.
The railway driver was delivered in the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe damage after he was met by a car on the Murray-Valley car on Saturday morning.
The police said the car driver continued without stoping to help the wounded driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia of the police in Shepparton became a police officer.
It will be probably accused of flight and delayed assistance and of other delegates.
The road carrier, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital. He is in a stable state.
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer strict Bellamy struggle against rivals because of arms to ring fights
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer ́ig Bellamy criticized his player's tackling as "Agenda-Setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Tray Trent Robinson said that the judges have allowed the storm games "Ring fight" with team during the high storm sequence in the Qualification Fine in Sydney on Friday.
Brisbane Broncos Tra′ Wayne Bennett made a little disturbable comment on the storm team after his manship had reached the final victoria against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday. He called the game a "model example" of Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the tacklimg of his mastership and said that they could only be addressed on their "contact".
Bellamy also adds that the criticism of two leading tragedies to his master is confident that it means that they were concerned about being struck by the storm team.
"I haven't heard that Trent Robinson was talking about ring battle when they struck us 24:2," Bellamy said midweek.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or technology throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact in Tackles to a real focus, and that has made the trend for us.
Trent has now been there for three years, and he obviously has a great multitude to train. So he is probably not used to lose it, so it was a little shock for him.
It's awesome how this is always happening again at this year.
Bellamy attacked the idea of Bennett's "treaming football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St. George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "languish" football.
Wayne's talking about stressing football.
He compared his game on Saturday with our Friday and how exciting her game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized as a long-term team, and Wayne said he would take care of a shit drink.
But now he has a team that can play and that we view as emotional, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like these.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a little worried to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they didn't think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game storm against Roosters had a result than the Broncos game against Cowboys.
The game of Broncos was probably a game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more trials in our game, but is this a surprising game?
Or are breaks, and no points are something scandal?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they admire us, it means that we're going to meet them in a phase.
The storm team has been free on this weekend because they have won the right, either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday in the prefinal in AAMI Park. The ticket up starts from the next morning.
Serbs with $200,000 purchasing accusation
A man who may threaten a lifetime punishment for his trial to get in possession of 40 kilograms of cocain, who were shooted to Queensland, was released against a $200,000.
Marko Maxsimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the Droge on the Yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and was located in Coomera in August.
Maxsimovic was observed how he met his complainant in Jachthafen during the morning and later in Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible long-term penalty for the trying to make a commercial quantity of cocain, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to try to make the whole amount and that it could have been in the café for an unfair reason.
The judge of the Master Court of Justice, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the flight in Maximovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the Court of Justice.
In the case of the penalty, he lied to the police about his residence.
Maximimovic's mother and shepherds have offered a cabinet of 200,000 × as a security together to gain his release.
"After reading the easily statements of the two persons, it is clear that the establishment of a security of 200,000 × is a real financial charge," said Judge Flanagan.
But that will not be sufficient to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maximsimovic was released against cutting, under the conditions that he departed his Australian and Serbian passport, reported to the police daily and kept on an outcome lock of 18:00-06:00.

Stevan Hogg's phone used by girls to lock pedophile to send pictures
A paedo used the phone of a 11-year girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she slept, registered into a online mailing series from which he received a number of unresponsible images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl wake up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She saw it, found the confusing reports and alarmed her mother immediately.
The police cared about it and saw the five images, then analyzed the computer found under the address and discovered "related" web searches, using the terms of search for unresponsible images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that he did it because it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and then "forgot to be a policeman to scare them."
The state advocate Eilith Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court: "he said it would be a search that he was able to scare people.
He told that the searches on the computer were performed by him, but he said it happened because he claimed to be a policeman to scare pedophiles.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent the pictures to him and asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lock them.
He said he was sick in his head when he drinks, and he said he wanted to see images of violence and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the tissue and weeping.
Then she also saw the inconsistent pictures on the phone and confronted the complaints with it.
The girl was interviewed and said the accused computer and playstation used to talk to girls that looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, explained himself guilty in the meaning of the accusation, to have taken unresponsible images of children on 14 June last year, to have murdered against the charges on 25 January this year and not to be before the court on 24 March of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg does not appear in the Register of sexual criminals, because it is possible to argument that "no exciting sexual element" would be found in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael removed the sentence until October to obtain background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was granted an accusation, but it was held in investigation due to consultations about other still existing cases.
He was taken into the list of sexual criminals before the date of the judgment.
Small cross-border cross-border clues to Germany
In addition to the major control points at the German-Eraic border, more refugees will be attacked.
Cleusers of fear of discovery and arrest increased in smaller border transitions
on the Austrian side, a speaker of the Federal Police said.
During the border stream Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been attacked in the country circles Passau and Rottal Inn since Tuesday.
They were reached to the German side over breasts and steel.
There they are taken into receipt by federal policies and continued to register.
At Münchner's Major Road Hof, the Federal Police Data came in comparison to the beginning of the week, again clearly more refugees in the midnight.
Only to 8:00 a.m., about 700 people arrived in the capital of the country, said a speaker tomorrow.
Following the recovery of controls at the German-Eraic border, on Sunday 1759 refugees reached the city.
Stuttgart: Exploder of the Tropenstorm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn against stormboys in the southwest of midweek afternoon.
As a result of a deep pressure area over Western Europe, heavy sea air flows in the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) shared in Stuttgart.
The powerful depth is the exhibitor of the Tropenstorm "Henry", which was held over the Atlantic in the past days of the Bermuda Islands.
Heavy storms and wheat are expected, especially in bathrooms.
According to DWD, it is also to be calculated in the Black Wald, on the Swedish Alb and on the ground-sea circuit with bowls from 60 to 90 hours.
Thus, on Friday, the sun can look longer.
The mass makes it: Every two years car builders show their news on the IAA.
2015 is especially moved in the compact cars that are currently very well-speaked.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly asked: 28,1 Pro of the new assessments will be produced by the KBA's automotive assembly only on this segment in August.
This also reflects the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Among all future concept vehicles and new high-class and luxury cars will be presented in this year, especially in many new compact models.
One of the largest premiums for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be in herbst with the traders.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," Opel-Cheef Karl-Thomas Neumann said on the messe.
He belongs to the corner of the mark.
In order to improve the volume model, the new Astra should also not be much more furious.
Opel provides an increase under the largest competitor VW Golf in view of 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra has a new 1,4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
The hair offers additional diet and benzine engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW//200 PS, which include the first number of tricycliner benziners.
In contrast to the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, there is only the Opel Astra as five.
As a second variant, the combi will be followed in the early year, which is already on the IAA.
And what is going to happen on new compact cars next to the Astra on the IAA?
Renault Megane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitive Megane to run.
On the messe, the Megan is exhaustively viewed as five furniture in a conventional and highlighted sports version of GT.
He comes into the trade in the beginning of the next year, then as a combi.
Infiniti: The whole new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan-Ableger wants to find his position in the strong growing segment with the new model.
The compact infinite with its broken lines is full of the design line of the mark.
The basic model will receive a benzin engine with at least 90 kW/122 PS.
However, in the boat there is also a diet with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates his world premiers in Frankfurt.
Boots shall be the model with benzin engines, including a newly developed 1,0-liter turbo engine and a performance of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum rotation moment is based on manufacturer information at 170 newton metres (Nm).
Baleno's purchase start in Europe is in early 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but rundum renewed is the DS 4 compact class model that is to be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the splendid citroen delegates placed mainly at the front side: here the cold grill was re-coated and the changed shields were equipped with LED technology.
In the internal room, the Infotaining System was mainly modernized, reduced the number of buttons by a touch and first integrated Apples CarPlay.
In addition, a series of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are included in the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin Tile: Five square meters cells are humanly unworthy
The Bundesconstitutional Court gave a former prisoner of the court of Justice Tegel, which was subjected for months in a too small cell.
As a result of the damage of human values, prisoners have fundamentally insisted on financial deficiency when they are subject to too small cells.
This has decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on the middle-week.
The parties concerned may, according to the judges, hope for money, even if they were only few days locked into the high rooms (p.m.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
In this way, an ex prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was in the Berlin's courtship camp between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square metres of ground area; the toilet was not spaciously distracted.
Afterward, the man who was replaced to a larger cell, according to his lawyer's information.
Although his complaint of arrest was decreased because of the unworthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin.
However, the Constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Court of Justice of Berlin and showed the case to renew Dorthin.
You see the human dignity of the man.
Chamber Court now decides over the height of the compensation
Although for legal reasons for the questionary period only a few days of detention for the compensation, it was said.
Otherwise, it would be "reserved to a person's legal protection."
The Chamber Court must now clothe the height of the cash charge.
The Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they spoke to a prisoner in April because he was locked in a cell.
A decision of 2011 also states that the multi-fold instruction of a cell without separate toilet is unlikely.
In addition, Karlsruhe also visited the Berlin Constitutional Court of Justice in a parallel case in November 2009.
The complainant was subjected over three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in Karlsruher case.
The Berlin prisons have also come into the bars in the last weeks because of missing staff.
Therefore, captives are always included 23 hours again, which increases aggressiveness, and it has already occurred on account of the stressed situation.
After the outcome of the court pressure office, 21 places in Tegel are not occupied because of growth failure, 19 will fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We create this"
The migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the federal cancer has decided to be on it.
What happens to Germany?
Approximately 800 000 asylum applicants will come to Germany this year, according to the statement of Vicecanzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is able to become a million refugees.
In view of the unusual challenge, the Federal Concern Angela Merkel (CDU) demonstrated resolution: "I say again and again: We can create it, and we create it."
What happens to Germany is the following review.
After various prognoses, apartments are used between 350000 (the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (the Pestel Institute) every year - and the next five years.
This is almost double as much as it is built up until now (250000 apartments).
The lack of residence is dramatic, but especially in payable holiday objects: annually, 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price, and for these special favorable apartments, refugees will also be charged.
Therefore, Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the support, from now on 518 million to a billion euro.
It is too few from the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social apartments should be developed annually, and that is why the Feder must invest an aid of 6,4 billion per year.
In some cases, the Federal Ministry and the Federal Building Minister also have to provide more tax benefits for investment in the building of apartment.
The Institute for Working and Professional Research is to conclude that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be acquired for a long term.
Nevertheless, the refugees in Germany would not be systematicly asked for their qualification to help them income, criticised ́a Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is determining whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the collection society, but also to the self-value of the immigrants, says the migration researcher Dietrich Thrennard.
In Germany, it states that it has given a political wandel: from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognize work.
Since there was an abortion for asylum applicants from up to five years earlier, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the obligation of residence to restrict the asylum applicant to a residence.
In the society, also because of the professional commitment, most of the views have been made that refugees should be enabled to make access to work quicker.
A large guard for access to work is missing German knowledge.
There is not yet a sufficient ship in general and practical language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most frequently provided by personal contacts.
The building of networks is therefore viewed by Threnhardt the Royal Road to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few lighting parents give their children in the Chinese, estimatedly up to 15%: "For the developed parents it is only important to keep the family together," Ilja Koschembar, speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Management.
To convince the family, however, of the benefits of the Kita, the administration distributes manuals in different languages.
If the need for refugees increased strongly by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to add training skills - sometimes by allowing more skills.
In the countries, students without German knowledge will be prepared for education in the welcoming class.
But they are not always teached by full-learned teachers and teachers, but, like in Berlin, also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as second.
They have no lack, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Management.
The German Student Work estimates that about 20% of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no federal asylum applicants or patients of the country - the only exception was until Berlin, inner senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has abandoned its attitude.
Voluntary refugees could facilitate access to high school.
Since refugees with a residence relocation or duration will no longer receive services in accordance with the asylum requesting law when they start in.
The latests are basically no baffags because they do not fall under the circle of the persons authorised.
Persevered refugees must have spent up to four years in Germany to be authorised by Bafög, from 1 January 2016, this Spanne is reduced to 15 months.
However, this financing has to be closed, Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Propertyship, and the German student work.
The farmers should get bafög immediately.
The Islam will futurely play a more important role, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, the religion is a major part of their integrity.
The State should successfully pursue Islam the same rights as they have the churches and continue to develop the existing State-Christian law to a new state-religious relationship.
It would also be important to create a islamic well-being association, which is professionally concerned with the newcommunicators.
The rights also belong to obligations.
In this way, the representatives of Islam must be ready to cooperate with the State in many areas and to establish certain control opportunities to him.
This is also the preparation to go better against religious fundamentalism.
The president of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed anxiety on Thursday, religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.
Those who wanted to expose such conflicts in Germany "have their right to live here, in Germany," he said in Bayrian.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
Integration will be a subject of the whole society in the future much more than today.
This will also be necessary to change the majority of the society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more difficult.
However, Germany has, as a result of decisions, a anti-discrimination body and a general equality law since a button of year.
However, it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, that the police and authorities systematicly ignored the racist motive.
The same opportunities for all: what migrant organizations and interest groups of non-white Germans have requested for a long time and to which international agreements like the German Anti-Rassism Convention have to be effective in the next years when the country remains peaceful and will use its new citizens and citizens to use their opportunities for all.
Generally, Germany is able to provide refugees expected to be medical, President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"What man-power and capacity are involved, we can do this," he said to the daily level.
However, it is necessary to flee social money into the system.
In order to avoid engaging, Montgomery calls for all accessories to the same time in the registration of health cards.
The benefits made may later be calculated with the federal countries.
And for a long term, it should be the most questionable to refuse so many people with the restricted performance catalogue that the asylum requesting law is predicted.
Otherwise, the doctors are making the language barriers, especially.
Moreover, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated that migrants are worse about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in Ar’s practices, dolmetics must be taken, it requests.
However, many refugees would have been helped with more general medical approaches in the emergency campaign.
And with another cube.
In some refugees, there are clearly more untreated obstacles, and in youths it is about HIV-absorption.
With the parts of other disease images, German doctors are clear from their training, but Montgomery says.
"Parasite or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And as regards the lack of the doctor, the refugees may even be in view.
The Syrians had a highly developed educational system, some refugees were even doctors.
In order to practice, however, they have to prove their qualification and may be tested again.
At least the half of the refugees coming in Germany is psychologically sick after the disorders of the Federal Psychotherapeutic Chamber (BPtK): most of them suffer under posttraumatic burden.
In fact, the refugee skinder is vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
One recently published TU München shows that each fifth Syrian refugee child comes traumatised in Germany.
Who is sick in a post-traumatic burden stage, among other things, suffers of so-called flashbacks with spirit, swine, heart races and death fears.
Other symptoms are sleeping and convergence, strong terrorism and emotional deepness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic, if necessary, an early treatment, stated Munz.
Too long, however, only four of the psychologically sick refugees receive psychotherapy.
As a result of psychiatric kra, asylum seekers in the social areas can make a request for a psychotherapie, the processing takes more than a few months.
Moreover, in the social areas, most of the professionals or doctors who are not trained for psychical diseases would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to failure assessments, says Munz.
Many begin to dream
With the new inscenation "Patience" the Circus Test returns to the traditions of circus art.
The objective is to drag each age group into the bank of fascinating acrobatics, animal rotation and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus test is putting into the many weapons on the cage to dream.
"Our patience is the circus."
"I can't imagine without living my circle family," Stephanie says Probst, Animal Teacher and Junior Chief.
"Patience" - under this mouth, the current manipulation is stated.
For more than 33 years, the cycle has been tested in the hands of the family.
So the gift to enjoy the family is in the blood.
"We are important to take people away from their all-day street and stay with them in a completely different world for two hours," stresses the 27-year-old Junior Chief.
"Manegen Cocktail with World City-Flair", so the director Reinhard Provst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3000 km long tour can now experience this flair.
The cycle program convinces talented artists throughout the world.
At the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarow Clown Family takes the public with witz and charme in their bank.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their handwork.
With the heroes of the timber films, it wants to take the cuban duo locker.
Easyness and movement - with these words they identify themselves.
His humorous art at the mast will bring female herds in the storm.
Except by numerous lach salts, the acrobatic of the Circus Test also fascinates with fingerprint feeling and relief.
Balance the inside on a ball?
It's not a problem for He Yuan.
Fascinate and fear the serpents at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is trusted with the oldest form of acrobatic as few other and fascinated with its movement.
60 employees from twelve N° offer in every way.
"The animals belong to our family," Stephany's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Insufficiencies in the situation of circles are only too often topics in different animal protection organizations.
Stephanie Probst also takes place: "If our animals are not good, we do not do well."
80 animals from five different continents enjoy each strike unit.
The "quarteen artists", as they are called lovingly, will be read every desire from the eyes as possible.
We want to work with the animals and enjoy them.
If the animal doesn't feel like it doesn't want it to be in many.
The main command is, therefore, that it is good for the animals.
Specially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture from a ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebrastute, the family Probst is proud.
The two animals have joined eight years in a walk, and nothing has been consumed.
"And then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," said Brigitte Probst.
Although Zebroid is not yet ready for many, it is the unique mascotch of the Circus Probst.
Thus, there should be something in each cluster.
"It's safe," Stephanie Provst says, "whether five or 1 200 lookers, we always give our guards and we're with the whole heart."
The Circus Probst invites its imaginations every day from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 hours.
On Sunday, the programme starts at 11 and 16 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the presentation at 17 hours the prices are reduced.
The animal view is open every day from 10 to 18 hours.
Zimbabwes Robert Mugabe holds wrong talks in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, the beginning of the year fell down from a podium.
He remained injured, but the video of the case was quickly spread over the social media.
The vote of the Parliament was also entrusted by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and had been warned that they would be accompanied by Mr Mugabe's calls.
In the past month, they had exhausted him and interrupted him during his speech about the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Saturday.
The speaker of the movement for democracy change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition policies have received SMS messages on their phones that they warned to sing Mr. Mugabes An日.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Dead'," he said journalists after Mugabes talk.
It warns the members concerned that the immunity ends in Parliament and immediately leaves Parliament that their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief speaker said that the party conducted by Morgan Tsvangirai was "inquired" of the more.
Hewlett Packard will reduce up to 30,000 workspaces
Hewlett-Packard will probably reduce 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and safeguarding efforts in the business services.
HP will subsequently divide into two banknotes and separate the computer and printer business from its fastest growing company hardware and its service business activities.
The expected destruction of staff leads to a charge of over 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, said HP in a claim.
"These restructuring measures will enable a competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise," Meg Whitman, HP President and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after training.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger focused than it is HP today, and we have a wide and depth portfolio of businesses undertaken by the companies in transition to a new business style," Whitman said.
As an autonomous company, we are better set up than ever before to satisfy the changed needs of our customers worldwide.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion dollars of annuity and "for the provision of inadequate, integrated technology solutions for companies", such as a company's claim.
It distributes a company founded by the deputy of Stanford's Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s to produce electrical installations and their Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley".
HP has passed a massive restructuring in order to control the discharge of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The HP measure, the worldwide biggest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US technology undertakings, is the latest in this area based on conviction that a closely focused undertakings are better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that team colleagues must stand behind the damaged Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed Wilshere that it was first in September and if his rehabilities were left in plan, there was no reason why he could not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly change at least the four next games for England and, in view of his history, his participation in the next summer of the European Mastership is safely unknown.
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had completed the last season after a separate knockel damage and then had found back too old swimming during the season.
"This kind of damage doesn't threaten the car," winger said.
It's a bone that wasn't well healthy.
This is not a greater matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his kidneys or the damage he had before.
This may be true from pure medical view, but as winger also recognized, there is the associated part of further damage, always when a player tries to restore in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unfair pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd has exposed 23 different diseases of Wilshere since six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 games in the last five games.
The larger image for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight games since 2007/08 one of the two Premier League Clubs that had to defeat the most damage days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the damage rates during the last season.
"As often, when you return from an injury, you have an accidental period, a time when you have to strengthen your body and win battle force," winner said.
Jack's young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body's stabilised, I'm sure he'll do it and he'll run a car from the way he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions-League season at Middle Wednesday against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the next midweek, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not traveling to Croatia, which means that Matthew Debuchy and Arta may start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Naco Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and to the players that need to give a small breakfast," winger said.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to continue by group F, the maximum stadium in Zagreb belongs to the games with the largest inflammation effect in Europe.
Dynamo has also been killed after 41 games after the "insecure" campaign has been started in the last season.
The stadium was shot by a landboat on Wednesday evening, and at the trial scale 3,2 had been shot.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has made the learning from the past season with the Champions-League capitalation against Monaco and remains exhausted from the remote hope of leading to the first European pokal triumph.
"This ship is incredible," winger said.
It's never been in Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm in business enough to be realistic.
We're eager, but we're not dreams.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar presentations in shows is obvious, especially in the way the need for men to open themselves now has become more disappointed than ever before, as self-mords among young men on a 15-year-old high.
In 2013 there was the most important cause of death in men of age from 20 to 45 in Britain, and there remained three times more frequent in men than in women.
In trying to reach the problem, the campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a heritage life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the goal to question the culture, preventing men from seeking help if they need them.
Friendship is the heart piece in the fight to meet this challenge.
A current Property in more than 2.000 high school school students with depressive symptoms indicated that if the sufferer had a sufficient high prosecution to friends with "sound vote", his chances of healing were doubled.
For those who are not depressive, a circle of spiritually healthy friends half the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you need to have friends only once so that a friendship can work.
In the age of communication on social media, with its focus on substance style, the immediate responsibility of the response is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital lives have the need to appear strong, vital, and doubled, even if the isolation actually dominates.
This surface success is dominated by what psychologists call out external values; money, image, social status, everything on costs of internal values - our inner look for personal development and friendship, which affects our spiritual health much more deeply.
And as a video player and billioner recently explained, money can't really buy happiness.
The niceness in Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which lighted by interaction as a friend.
The Humor of Joey and Chandlers often injuries, moments at football bucking in funeral seasons and the look of Ross to Rachel - all this came from that men can be involved in any case, even if they are often delayed to discover their feelings completely.
Like a telephone carrier, it explained to me: "My listening role for people who are depressive and self-mothered has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can be undergone."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old speaking "I'm coming to it" has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it will be felt weak when you talk about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I'm trying to offer long-term mechanisms.
It is clearly presenting the small moments of men's friendships.
So much my objective external status on the phone can also help people at the moments of discovery, which long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend comedy Central FriendsFest with the culies completely new-formed at the festival of the day, why don't you take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a laugh and tell him Hello.
You never know what undershread your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria comes to help PSG break Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after meetings against Malmö.
Di Maria arrives in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to go to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League Saison with a very comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmoe at the Prince Parkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the beginning of his Champions League Debouts as PSG player, who made the French master on the road, but then they lost a number of opportunities before they finally increased their mind when Cavani reached a headballtor in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk in the group A, Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish Master, not only seeking the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but a improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, there was no classic game of Laurent Bla's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics lost chances before the gate. He was later changed in the game against his hometown team and the United, with which he started his illustrated kare already in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or outside in the Champions League. Therefore it's a good start 2:0 to win our enemies to cause problems and relax, even if there are certain things we need to perfect during the season," she said.
"This is a sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I'm sorry that we haven't reached one or two other gates."
Ibrahimovic returned after his damage in one of the three changes to the Paris team, which could hold a 2:2 undetermined on its own place against Bordeaux in the first Liga, but he was exhausted in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The argentinian flight storm was obscured when the man who could take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken in the last month of Manchester United, and he stated why when he entered in Marco Verrattis Pass behind Malmoe defence before he quit beautifully in the long corner of the network to Johan Wiland.
But if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory that was disappointed.
Malmö, the Celtic struck in a play-off to achieve this level, came to Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-men's defence and two deeply in the middle field a severe enemy.
But other than a shot of Nikola Djurdjic, which was far from Kevin Trapps Phosts in the 34s.
Instead, the PSG himself was sometimes discovered, with some deficiencies and bad conclusions, not later by Ibrahimovic, who suffered not less than five trials alone in the first half, and then was abandoned after Cavani had set it after restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more when he played his fellow players in the game, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic that you converted Di Maria into a drehshot, which was aligned by Wiland in the 52th. Minute on the river...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour-mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayer achieved his sixth season, after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flat of Maxwell.

The qualification games are not expired."

It was a great game of them!

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented Switch to FC Bayern
World and Europe Master Xavi has played since summer 2015 for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Katar
The FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago before Spain's Superstar Xavi's commitment, who played for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish Master, three times Pokalsiers, four times Champions-League-seager, two times Club World Masters, two times European Masters, one times World Master - the title list of Xavi is breathing.
In summer, the average 35 years after 24 years left the FC Barcelona and changed to al-Sadd Sport Club to Katar.

"You told me Barza wanted me to cover."
"Madrid won everything, we didn't," he said.
And that also registered the FC Bayerns.
Xavi: "There was a Bayern boat."
"Rummane wanted me."
Remember: In Summer 2008 Jürgen Klinsmann received the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change wasn't standing.
And the exhaustive man today for the German recorder: Pep Guardiola.

Twitter-user Mr. Pooni has expressed his anger over the Clip by writing "Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, so he can declare it - that's so WEISS that it does damage."
The second deserved more than 5.000 rats and 4.000 Likes since it was published.
Damon's comments come to a time when the precise racial representation is located in the media at the top of the social discussion.
After the teenage Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the movement of Black Lives Matter achieved the effect and forced laws and authorities to deal with discriminatory practices against colorful contents.
In February, the song Prince made an advice to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums quietly matter," (albens still have their importance) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their importance.
In younger times, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement, although response to the question of Fox News personality Elizabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be viewed as a hats group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a group of love," the leaders said.
Recently, Damon was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, products and media methods invited to visit the father to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
If he has accepted the invitation or has already met the father, it is unclean.

According to the rules, the money is going to the fastest person.

He received a mass of exhibitions from Fans.
He's a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.

And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had forgotten the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was prolonged for a eighth staff, the road work will be started in early 2016.

Rome now has a Martin-Luther place
Nearly 500 years after reform, there is now a Martin-Luther place in Rome.
In the presence of President of the city Ignazio Marino, the name of the German reformer was baptized at the middle of the midweek in the park on the oppio hill.

Hammer Artist invested three years in the Bible’s personal interpretation
Jesus is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has drawn for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
Was the word at the beginning?
No, not in the Otmar-Alt Bible, which is now happening with beautiful images.
At the beginning, the picture for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motives formulated his entire personal interpretation of Bible stories on paper and linwand.
His "language" with bunch colors and imaginative forms has received the 75-year-old - which is no way equal to the "lightful" images.
On the contrary, the topic is adjusted, and it can certainly work quite darkly.
Three years Otmar Alt has found a Bible project for which he has found a subjective artistic selection from many theme areas of the "book of all books".
Residences are circles that spread topics such as crossway, plans, commands or father's children.
It has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to Luther's record with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler's record with focus on art books.
And there is, in particular, the author Klaus Altepost, who has seen each other on the basis of the painting with the relevant Bible verses.
He interpreted the Bible texts selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" in current conferences.
These texts are like verbal mirror of old painting.
They are incorporated between the original Bible citizen of Martin Luther and each of the set of the artist, which forms his entire personal thoughts about the situation.
The swimming band has gold letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old will double a deep insight in his soul, his emotions.
This is a high measure of intimity.
Emotions were soon exposed to the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 born in Vernigerode and wake up in Berlin, come from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Lord Hutter Order.
"It's been the learning with the rohrstock," Otmar Alt says.
"I've tried to work it up so that I may be with Mr. Dad again."
His second argument is to help the art back to more valuable: "The observation of image worlds is today in advertising, and it is sound.
The symbolics are broken down there.
Artists have another pleasure and pleasure to show things.
Images always have something secret and are not decorative.
"In this regard I'm a dinosaurian."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "income" into the images, let them act, discover and see what power they have: "The image is looking for his opposite."
Klaus Altepost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "always" to be a lover of Otmar Alts Art: "I like how he understands life with his images."
Ancients have not regarded the full understanding of the Bible, but have chosen the important, mysterious topics for him.
"It wasn't co-operation at the top of the eyes," Altepost says: "This is about the images that the text only states." Resistance is a picture Bible.
For Hans Mohler from Luther's Storage, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alts images speak for mealers both the (biblical) language of love and the responsibility.
A part of the original - paper and linwand images - is first presented in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Building beginning for BMX Banner
Plans made, found space, firms ordered, modeled for a course: A year later it was almost completed - but before the official exhibition of the BMX tree, it was already closed.
Insurance in and administration, especially in the people who did not want to dull the trains, were providing for disgusting, especially for the people.
So the hills are cut off, look for a new place - now with formal planning and request for building approval.
The approval will come in October, and the first Community engine Sabine Mosebach-Book could now communicate in the Child and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year is still visible," she said.
Then it should be started without "super memory pause" with work in the former holiday bathroom.
DFB intensified commitment for refugees
The DFB exposes its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Federsliga sets a clear sign on the weekend.

"It's in principle nobody can say, that's nothing to me, I don't have anything to do with it."
"It must be interested in everyone to get this topic into the grip," DFB-Chef Wolfgang Niersbach said.
At the annual meetings with the Federal Conzler Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to intensify the refugee situation in Germany.
"I am at the office next midnight, and I'll meet the state minister Ms. Özoğuz and the officer."
"The theme will certainly play a central role," he announced.

Some associates also undertake this programme.

"We also want to make clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," Leverkusens Sport Chief Rudi V ́er of the "image" quotation (thursday) and covered the preservation as "self-comprehensible".
"The flighting drama comes to everyone, no one can go away."
"We can, no, we have to use our radio force, our influence and our opportunities to help many refugees who have already suffered so incrediblely," said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's business leader Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the Liga".
For the EM Qualification Game against Hungary this Friday, the national group of women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach emphasized the support of refugees as "a large Community work of German football".
That all 36 licences in their places had started their own projects, is great.
It's too great that small and smallest units are active.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have issued, will be held in the football.
"This is of great importance," he said.
In this and the next year, the link will be available together with the DFB election and the Federal Government for the integration of refugees.
"The units have already received the whole sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.

"I think we have a chance to break the title."

In accordance with one of the provisions presented by the Ministry of Economy, high-automatic drives will be technically possible until 2020.
Nevertheless, free cars on public roads are expected to "from 2020".
The creation of values in the field of vehicle assistance systems and high-automatic drive functions at the place of Germany estimates the authors of the Property for 2025 to approximately 8,4 billion euros.

In France, 21 Pro of the Questioners are calculated by 2025 with automotive cars, in the United States 33 Pro.
Without prejudice, the car cars in Germany are not yet ready to leave completely on a self-leaving vehicle.

Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture from a very large moden view and a growth-figure rubber cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work in the middle of the week.
The height points: Shopping pups that thanks to video projections look terriblely humanly.
She is the special crew of the French designer, who, inter alia, became with Madonna's big star of the shen - and so that he was putting men in smoke.
"I can't say this day I'm the horrible infant of the skin couture because I have white hair."
"Before it was held, in the middle of it is true," said Gaultier.
For the surveys of the Exposition "From the Sidewalk To the Catwalk" (From the citizens to the running step), which is to be seen on 18 September in the arts of the hypo culture, it is a happiness that the Creator has changed his denied attitude to a view of his person at first.
In fact, he was contrary, because, "A exhibition sounded for me a little after death," he said.
If you're driving, you'll get into the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made at the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the art challenge, Roger Diederen.
It's about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exponers give an insight in the little more to oversee the work of the man who has written historicals, without ever having a learning.
Chronologically, the sight is not built, but it is a great croreographical art work for which many efforts were conducted: to refresh the puppes, for example, a stylist was involved.
14 tonnes of material, the manufacturer, after information from the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, caught to monkeys.
Shortly before the beginning of October the festival, there was another special Schmankerl: a Lederhosen profit with corset.
Heydi Madonna's match.
He always was interested in strong women ("Fraces are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Even Gaultier's old tee is to be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, viewful modic attempts of the designer.
As a child (he wasn't a good student and bad in the football) he joined Te日 BHs and clothes, said Gaultier.
To play with a puppet, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
He learned the drafts of itself later.
He stole magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in München.
I've been buying them later, but of course.
For his first modes view, he could not pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they could keep the clothes.
Smuck town Gardine - Blue bridge like-nick
Earlier, it came to the long stack machines and to plane to make meters.
The covered substances and spices occurred in large quantities for customers, for example, to cover and gardens.
This is no longer functioning today, says Andreas Reinhardt, the business leader of the spice Plauen.
Instead, it is important again.
In the early times of the Plauener Spitze played a greater role, then the home textile industry was forced - and now it is discovered as noise.
Reinhardt calls some examples: Spits in Smuck, accessories such as shoes and regional tracts.
In general, the so-called vintage mode that refuses to past style pockets is a continuous job potential.
Whoever doesn't use niski in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already make the help of all the tasks.
Spice Plauce is accompanied with nine other companies in the Branchenband Plauener Spitze and Stickers.
Only they can get the label.
In the last 15 years, approximately 80% of the turnover were disrupted.
Faching businesses and the big trade are almost no longer.
Our products are not yet available to the customers in this way.
The massware will be produced much more billiger in Asian room today and almost exhaustly over keets.
○ weak export, currently to Russia and to the United States.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The branch band also tries to point by environmental conscience, such as Cordula Bauer from the stackperle in Falkenstein, "From this year, we have conducted a quality signal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially significantly."
Reinhardt added: "It also refers to the materials used."
Diplomdeigner Ute Schmidt teaches at the Snowberger outside of the West Saxon High School Zwickau - at the Faculty for Applyed Arts - and is specialized on stakes and spices.
To cope with the competition from the Asian room, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a spending field between the most fresh ideas of designers and the businesses that need to think economically," Schmidt says.
Therefore, a existing design often is easy to vary only to hold a customer stem.
A few years ago, the textile disigner Kati Re repeated the historical snowball pipe.
The machines in some places are sticking small kitchens.
The Plauener Gold Schmiede Master Bianca Hallebach's crews inspired it: "I couldn't start with traditional blue spitze before."
Now she uses the snowball shoes for her beauty.
In an outstanding procedure, she draws the pattern in silver.
"Multium people in the region are identified with the theme Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Re日.
It also provides in the United States, after and to Finland - especially to customers whose preachers have been held in plans and environments and want to have a reminder.
I see my beauty as a modern newsman of the Plauener Spitze.

But the director is already firm: Rob Marshall, later with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi forces to open the economy widely for the world
The economy must be opened out to promote growth, President Xi Jin said on Wednesday, a group responsible for reform.
"China should be used to block foreign investments and Know-how and improve business foundations," he said at an advice at the 16th meeting of the central leading group for deepening a comprehensive reform.
To promote and promote reforms will bring new sweetness and vitality and offer a new place for economic growth, said Xi.

According to the statement, a negative list will be established to identify sectors and enterprises that are not concerned for investment.
The system is tested and improved by test programmes after and after.

The Government will also lock controls on the powers of companies and ensure that enterprises decide how they carry their business.
The statement also said that China would allow border areas to identify new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In the framework of a boat, to open publicly controlled sectors, further areas for private investments will be opened.
"The Government will not change its foreign investments and will make the legal interests of foreign-financed enterprises and provide better services for them," stated the statement.
Furthermore, for foreigners it is easier to provide a permanent residence authorisation or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of the lawyers to guarantee their activities and to establish professional judges and advocates was also discussed at a meeting.
At the meeting, also Prime Minister Li Keqiang and major leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli participated in a report published after the meeting.
The EU wants to duplicate cut-silver-green value in raw fish
The European Commission wants to duplicate the limits for checking silver in large fishing and to give consumers a clear dose of the nerve tax.
The consumer organisation of Foodwatch, which provides a relevant work paper in the EU, criticized the plans: "The risks and adverse effects of defected industrial and environmental policy will be continued with full growth to pregnant and small children," said Matthias Wolf Schmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolf Schmidt, the limits of the nerve tax for big fish at the end of the neighborhood, such as hail or hairfish, for "economic policy reasons" will be decreased by one to two milligrams cuck silver per kilogram of fish.
However, big fishers are so strongly charged with checking silver today that, on the basis of the still applicable limits, about 50 per cent of the captures cannot be recovered.
After the duplication of the limits, only 14,5 per per cent would be unprofit.
In contrast to this lockering, the EU would like to increase the limits for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of cuck silver per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, was a "trick", because smaller fridge fishes, such as coppers, are most lowly charged that they have the planned maximum values already today.
The decline in small fish is therefore "a perfect decline manover that only helps the economy," said Wolfschmidt.
Queck silver is a high-total heavy metal for humans, which is highly added to the narrow sheet, especially in raw fish.
Therefore, the Federal Government warns that "before preparing small amounts may cause in particular unborn damage of the nervous system".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on its homepage that the maximum values are applicable, but it is not expected to expect "the healthy risk of the general population".
Queck silver is mainly obtained by the burning of coal into the environment.
According to a written outcome of the Federal Ministry of Environment to the Green Bundesday Deputy Baerbock, more than six tons of Queck Silver per year, two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany.
The convergence of Queck silver in fish, as well as in Elbe, Rhein and Donau, was "persevering and laterally covered", the "speak" quoted out of the paper on March.
In the past year, Europe’s warnings against checking silver in fish were already related to the most common health risks reported in the EU warning system RASFF.
