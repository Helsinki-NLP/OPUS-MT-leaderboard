Guest: More security for footsteps
They are not 100 meters away from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33 foot-trailer was taken in operation in Gutach at the village park - in view of the older rath example.
Two facilities are so close to each other: an object or a protector?
This question has clearly answered Gutach's citizen yesterday.
"The rath sample has been installed at that time because it safeguards the school road," said Eckert yesterday.
The Cluser-Amp is safe both Radiators and bus travelers and the mountains inhabitants.
The installation of businessed yesterday is important for the Sulzbachway/Chirch Street crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the bus holder, a Ar and a bank, as well as the flow from the residence area ›Grub·.
"When the high crowd and foot passenger arrived, there had to be another appeal to their security," it was Eckert.
This also affects Peter Arnold from the Land Council of Offenburg.
"As current measurements are carried out on B 33 every day, approximately 12 000 vehicles are the Gutach community, which are about ↓ Pro swarming transport," says Arnold.
Therefore, the building of another ample is more than necessary: "Security is just going on here," as Arnold.
In total, four views have been performed, including a circuit traffic, but it has re-employed because of the engine in the Sulzbachway/Chirch Street.
Arnold was expressed at the location of the ampelmasters before all: "The middle of an extra for us with a special wood-loaded transporter we have equipped whether these vehicles can go from the summerway to B 33 without cutting the ample mass."
The approximately 15,000 euros are the "modernest thing that is on the market" stated by Arnold.
The installation is equipped with colorful LEDs that light so powerful that, for example, the lights of the car cars are well recognized in the deep sun.
And she is also spacious: The older light facilities consume about 100 Watt, newly eight Watt.
There are three light facilities per vehicle direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new installation: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
Pressing the footsteps the applet button, the upper radiar sensor tests the screenshot.
If the street is free, it comes directly green for the footsteps, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the footsteps.
"If a group or obsessed people go through the street, the green phase will be extended, so everyone is safe over the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the car driver must think here as partners and watch the trains.
This wasn't the case yesterday: When the ampel showed the green floor, a high-class vehicle broke through - by lighting red.

A Blackbox in the car?
US travel planners are looking for a source of money to repair the highway system, and they believe that the solution is found in a small black box that is located in the armature box of each car.
The devices that set up each kilometer and report the information to the authorities are the key point of a controversial attempt from Washington and the United States planning offices to revise the old system for financing US roads.
Normally, the longer-term area of road planning has suddenly simplified an intensive debate with bound alliances.
Libertaries have been connected to environmental groups and are expected that the Government can use the small boxes for the road - and perhaps where they were driven - and then use the information for the management of tax collectives.
The Tea Party is surprised.
The Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
However, while some are not able to take action at the Congress, several states are not long waiting for.
They are currently checking how they can change to a system during the following years, paying the driver per mile.
Thousands of car drivers have already tested the drivers from which some are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"There is nothing that we can only use," Hasan Ikhrata, the business leader of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plant a record of the miles driven by all California carriers in the country since 2025.
The way we make these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes to a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from taxes, is made up the US Amer more in the sample.
But in America it isn't so much as before.
Cars consume less gas.
The State Mineral Oil Tax of 18,4 cents per Gallone (not less than 4 eurocents per liter) has been reduced for 20 years.
more wages at high press prices not to raise the tax only for a cent.
"The benzin tax is simply uncomfortable," so Lee Munnich, a expert for transaction law at the University of Minnesota.
His Federal State has recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to test a mile-based payment system.
"It is the long-term most meaningful alternative," he said.
Officecrates are the same as a media-based user tax.
It is not surprising that the idea of state liberalities is an accent, for example, tax was allowed to use the conduct of the driving in order to reduce waste and climate damage.
The Californian planners set up the system for the development of ambitional and legally harmonised climate change objectives of the Federal State.
However, the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, president of the House Transport Committee, also stated that he looks at the most long-term alternatives in that.
In addition, the Free Contributors of the Reason Foundation have been made by the idea to leave the driver backwards.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black lock," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Directives in Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement will also be supported by two former ministers of the former Ananias, who in a report in 2011 invited the Congress to move towards milk-based deficits.
The U.S. Senat approved last year a 90 million teures pilot project that would include 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the representative house prevented the prejudice and thus reacted to the thoughts of members of rural areas representing people who often have to leave a lot of miles every day on the way to work or to the city.
Many federal states and large cities are not moved in this way, despite itself.
The most involved is Oregon, currently 5.000 drivers for the largest experiment of the country.
These drivers will soon be charged with the milk charges of the Mineral Oil tax to the Federal State.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also adds something like that.
Illinois tests it in a limited measure with Lkws.
And the I-95 coalition in which the Conference Ministers of 17 States belong to the East Coast (a.k. Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) are currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, car drivers were skeptics in thinking that the government could follow every movement.
"Remember against the Big Brother and such things were a big problem," says Alaudin Khan, leader of the management of the Nevada Presidency.
The people didn't want it.
When the test arrived, Nevada's LU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to convert the drivers into elected monitoring devices."
There is no need to build a huge, sprayed technology infrastructure that would be unrejectively used to obtain data on the daily movement of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a series of federal states who now look at difficult technology, with which the State can take the kilometers driven, but not win exactly and where.
So, like Khan, the public would also be more comfortable.
The jail after this technology led some authorities to a small startup company named True Mileage in California.
The company has not originally been attracted to help federal states in taxing car carriers.
Moreover, it was their goal to take feet in an effortful market for Kfz's insurance, where the drivers were to cover on the basis of the mile.
However, its tested devices are also interesting for the road planners because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded.
“The people are better ready to share in if their speed and locations are not opened,” said Ryan Morrison, business leader of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilots, great errors were made.
There are essentially more billiged and less intrusive opportunities to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experience to give car drivers a number of choice options.
You can decide for a device with or without GPS.
Or they select no equipment and then devote a pause tax based on the average miles driven by all the residents of the Federal State.
Other bodies hope to be able to decrease the concept of a misleading public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, the Officer wants to develop a taxation device that allows parking taxes to pay, a assurance is to be paid only for drivers and the speed data from other vehicles in real time can be exhausted by their car car rental.
"Auto carriers would be motivated by the additional value of the benefits offered by the system to participate," it says in a city planning document.
Some planners, however, ask whether the whole thing about payment per miles is not just a huge decline.
In the Metropolitan Transport Commission for the San Francisco Bay, officers declared that the Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankroot Highway Trust Fund by enhancing fuel taxes.
An additional single tax or an annual taxation may be established by car vehicles with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little benzine, so that they also have a fair share.
"There is no reason for a operation if an aspirin is sufficient," Randy Rentschler, the leader of the Commission's legislation and public matters.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of car drivers are concerned about their speech and many other things.
Royal field: Small manages wake up
The volunteer firewall, despite the lack of staff with Bravour, made their herbs' samples.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
The Department Commander Hans Camerer had chosen the present Feder in the Burgberger Street in his exercise.
There should be a short closure when saying.
Through the coming fire and smoke development, two people were hurt, but one of them could have no more call.
Two breath protectors were prepared to attend the building after the first review of the sackage by Hans cameras.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and to lead to free.
The second person had to be held.
This was not so easy because it was to overcome a hard step.
The building, a workplace with integrated station for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and a lot of electricity balls in it.
Moreover, there were electrical machines for wood processing.
The first solution attack occurred through the tank in the vehicle.
Another guide was conducted by a overflow hydrant in approximately 100 meters away.
Now three solution attacks could be made.
For use, there was also a high-scale roof in the building.
Hans Cameror was also in practice to show what is to be processed with a little staff available.
In the serious case, the Royal Department Group is supported.
The commander was satisfied with the end of the exercise.
Connection of high schools and companies is important
On the country of Breisgau-Huchschwarzwald, the country president Guido Wolf also opened up in Titisee-Neu, where the workers come from tomorrow.
In the Supreme Schwartzwald, he followed with the business leaders of the vocational schools, as well as the circuit gymnasium and the chairman of this important question.
"Education is an important location factor," stressed Others, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the linked school project Education's high-swarm force.
The Wolf showed himself impressed on the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there is a close cooperation between the supporter, the circuit gymnasium and the professional school.
○ He praised family friendship in the country.
"It is important not only to have the family stage in the corner, but also, due to the demographic change, the phase on the care of the maintenance of the people," said Wolf.
→ He stressed that more employees were concerned about the care and maintenance of their members.
"Unless the employees support, the burden of employees can lead to an end of work," Wolf said.
But no one can allow it to lose the loss of work forces, he continued.
Another, especially important is the networking of high schools and companies.
"Therefore, who has already learned the advantages of the region, remains able to get his abilities often from the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," showed the country president convinced.
Because only if adequate training plans were offered, the need for professionals can also be covered.
See opinion, the location of the country circle is its beneficial situation in southwest Germany, directly near France and Switzerland.
○ He experienced on his train from Titisee-Negt to Freeburg the efforts already taken to expand the public traffic.
"Continue to stay hard and make sure that the public transport will be better," he explained to the address of the present communal policies.
Take with music a pleasant afternoon
Since 15 years, the family Kaul has invited the dieting elders to coffee, kitchen, and then to a wheat.
Earlier, the elderly citizens were appreciated in the race.
Meanwhile, this afternoon will be located in the Watchtower of St. Josef.
The householders enjoyed the beautiful kitchens and tortes.
Later there was a worth salat.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were discussed with some melodies.
More than 100 years old natural stone walls as the previous limitation of the old school head to the Church Street before the sanation will be replaced with the sanation cost plan of the city of Braunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, in the first works of the sanation of the former school head, a small angle wall was built for stabilization and statistical discharge of the old natural steel wall with ballustrade.
The next step is to provide Alexander Misok from the Braunling town building, to include the country's memory office in the planning and to create a sanation concept for the old walls.
Thereafter, a cost shall be taken by experts who will then be put on the table to the Community to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision about it is expected to take place already in the next year.
After the sanation, flattering and tree-building of the old school head within the two side-flights of the 1912 school, it must be made in an inappropriate time as a follow-up, the needed sanation limiting walls are based on sanitation and new rebuilding.
The historical, a hundred years old decade walls of the old school head to the church street, is especially through water and frost shades, since there is no drainage, needed sanation and has a booting forward.
Deep rises in individual stones are evident of whistling damage, but the wall is currently not unturned.
A safe wall is a condition for one of the students who use schoolhof, which has been carried out by the current consolidation work.
Originally, school headquarters were planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned issues had a movement.
A significant word in the historical school wall discipline, which has already been used for movie records, will be discussed by the Landscape Office.
If the standards come from this side, the city hopes that the breunlingen will be able to acquire the thoughts.
The students of the Braunling basic school, who are learned again in a well-sanned old school building with a new aula, can soon use the old school officer.
Özdemir wants Jazza training in Stuttgart
In the persistent discussions on the future of the musical schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, the Federal President of the Green, has now been activated.
"I think it's wrong to leave the entire education in the school of Stuttgart," Ozdemir said the "Stuttgart News".
Jazz and classics belong to the jazz location Stuttgart.
This is the opposite of Özdemir, which is used in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate at the conference-day election on 22 September, the Green-Red Government.
This forces a reorder of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg based on an expert study.
Afterwards, Jazz and Pop will be deposited from the Music Hoch School Stuttgart to the Manheim Music Hoch School.
US border: "Super tunnel" discovered for swimming
At the border between Mexico and the United States, researchers have discovered and set up a "super-tonnel" for the swimming.
As the US tariff recipients reported, the railway between Tijuana and San Diego was over 500 meters long, with electricity, trailing bridge and a explosion facility.
Three sentences were then arrested, eight tons of Marihuana and almost 150 kg of cocain.
The tunnel has not been used, according to the information.
"These cards are stupid if they think they could go through under the radar," said the General State Advocate of the Southern United States District, Laura Duffy, at a press conference before a storehouse in San Diego, where it was discovered an end of the tunnel.
Duffy assured the bands: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we have decided to make it a huge disturbance of your smuggling money."
The US and the Mexican security forces are in a duration fight against the cards.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in relation to criminality.
Build by Experts
As a result of the exhaustive compensation of the tunnel, the investigators believe that it was built by architects and engineers and that the building was approximately one year.
The glass installation was so equipped that electrically driving cars could be used there.
On the Mexico side, access is in a building that is 80 meters away from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader of 20 meters leads to the depth of the tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has an average of 1,20 meters height and 90 centimeter width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the sentenced were adopted in relation to the cocain fund.
The third, a mexican, was deceived because of the obsessed Marihuanas.
All three are threatened as the highest penalty of lifelong freedom, as the officers said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it's the first time that cocain was found in such a tunnel building.
Normally, cocain is in smaller quantities and not in tunnels.
This shows the "depreciation" of the bands whose traditional rounds were cut between, Bill Sherman said of the defence of DEA in San Diego.
They'd do everything to get into the United States.
No details were given to the arrested, at least one of the mexicanians, it was called.
You must count in prison penalties until years.
2014 Goisinger Festival Year
The Jubileum of the city of Geisingen at the beginning of the 1250.
Again, the first original creation is always closer.
When the year ends in eight weeks, the Jubilee year is on.
794 church houses were initially trained together for the first time.
In churches, an orchard was entrusted in both places.
On March 15, there will be an official record for Jubilee Year, and since there is no holiday, this recording event will be located in the place where the first 1250 years ago both were invoked in church houses.
In the context of Jubilea, several events are scheduled both in ships and in church houses.
Church-housen will be on a weekend from 18 to 20 July 1250 in July.
Repeat.
On Friday with a festival, Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church Halls.
This weekend is also the Church-Housenian Church festival.
The City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written for the city a mission composite to the Jubillä to be listed at three dates.
On June 21, together with the sun-wind celebration of the Black Wald Conference, on 12 July in the Arena with firework and 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival.
This will be completed in Jubilee's year and indicated that official date is on the last week of September, 27 and 28 September.
In the case of the Geisinger City Jubilea, there is also a new history.
"But it should be a history not only of his own lusts, but a printed work about today's gissing, which consists of historicals, church-houses, leipherdings, alphadings and good-madings," said citizen Walter Hengstler.
And even today's holiday celebrations 2014 Birthday, 1974, the modern space was completed with the communities.
The new history will then be presented in the new festival on 21 or 22 November.
However, 2014 is another year with many jubilees.
On February 8, the Narren-Glonki-Strohglonki starts with a use-night of its 60-year-old existence, the Harmonie Gutmadings becomes 90 years and has the festival on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The old work Leipferdings will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new place for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Music Verein Polyhymnia Leipherdings becomes 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the Brun festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was initially trained in 764 Closter of St. Gallen.
The urkundes were entitled in churches (housen) that was the court place at that time.
Both communities are therefore included in the same origins.
The reason for 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year-old age is still 40 years old.
Advises glass devices in the viewer
Whether to rebuild the transition "Am Hirschen" permanently to increase the security of the screen
Yeah, the communities have been locked.
It must take 220 000 euros in hand.
The German Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal bathlines in the next year.
In order to enhance the safety of travel transmissions, it is generally common to train collisions with other vehicles.
When the communities vote on the restructuring measures, they must share the costs with a third party, which divides the road and the bond.
Schiltach City Baumeist Roland Gruchthaber presented to the community the needs of the "Am Hirschen".
There the city plants to build an exhibition at the west of the roads.
There may also be greater vehicles, such as those transporting long wood, in the opposite, without blocking the glasses.
Gruchthaber therefore proposed to build a necessary support wall so that the city could expand the next road at a time to ensure an unfair flow.
This was discussed in the assembled controversians, since some advice had the need for a road spread in doubt: Thomas Kipp with his statement the vote of the critics on the point: "Will we take so much money for so few vehicles?"
Citizen Thomas Haas opposed: the transition "Hirschen" will be regularly enjoyed for long wood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over these streets because the vehicles could not use the streets on the heberlesbrücke because they could not escape from the main roads.
Furthermore, the trailer for vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is locked arguments.
Since it is necessary to avoid that Kirchberg and Clossberg tunnels are rebuilt and sanated, as this is currently in Wolfa of the case, the transition "Am "Hirschen" can also have a significant significance for a longer period.
The Council agreed to examine what costs would cause the increase in the road.
Nevertheless, the rebuilding of the travel transition was mostly agreed with the measure that the needed support wall will be built so that the city can expand the next road direction "Bahnhofstraße" for meeting traffic at approximately 5.5 metres.
However, the conversion of the travel transition in the Gerberei Trautwine could lead to a very different problem relating to the highly growing "Gerolt House Road".
The administration had allowed the rebuilding plans of the train by the Engineer Breinlinger office, since it had doubts of whether the planned connection to the Geroltzhouse road was still possible without any further.
The investigation concluded that it was not to exclude that the street-relations could lead to longer vehicles.
The responsibility for this is to carry the city again as a road builder.
The rebuilding can therefore be able to travel in prison.
Since both the wooden and the destruction worked in the current extent, it was not to agree with the conversion of the travel transition, Haas argued.
In addition, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is clearly less than the other travel transitions, since it is directly within the centre of the holding point to which a viewing connection exists.
Even moves from the main roadhouse must have been so disturbed at this place that no collision is threatened.
The majority of the rebuilding of this travel transition was refused to accept, since the city Schiltach had to "suck out" the problem with ongoing vehicles, as the advice, since the roads could be removed from the responsibility after the construction work.
It is unproblematic that the body considers the conversions to the travel transitions "For Heubach" and "For Kuhbach", for which already cross agreements have been reached with the train.
It decides on big world space missions: Missions for billion
Remote planets, gravitation wools or black lowers - experts of the Property Room Traveling Journal now have to take up two large projects that they want to start in the next years.
30 proposals were for the selection, five are still running.
Remote worlds.
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomes.
No one knows whether there is at least some of them.
Selection is hard: should you search for gravitation sources?
Or do you like to investigate the origin of the Cosmos?
Or do you get to the earthly planets to discover foreign life?
These questions are addressed to the responsibles of the Esa Room Traveling Board.
For their Cosmic Vision program, they are looking for ideas for two large space projects to make research decisively.
The food for such "L" missions is about a billion euros.
The start will probably be 2028 and 2034.
In the beginning of September, the elite of the world space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were discussed, and five of them have now come to the worst choice.
A number of bodies used the proposals, following the researchers.
The Scientific Programme Committee shall take a final decision in the next days.
In total, four large questions have chosen the Esa to find answers to the missions of the 2007 initiated "Cosmic Vision".
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and lives?
The exact operations in the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the creation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the speaker darkness.
A big infraroot telescope in all could cross this darkness.
And if a star planet, in what circumstances can life be found there?
In order to follow this question, 2017, the space telescope "Cheops" will be started, with the 500 already-planet systems in our nearest environment.
But the opportunities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With greater instruments, the astronomes could represent similar planets and even analyze the composition of their atmosphere and so search for "Biomarkers": gases that apply as an index for biological A.
How does the sun system work?
In addition, this question should be clearly concluded about the conditions for the resurrection of life.
A important role plays the magnetic A of a star and the exchange of its magnetic field and the radiation of parts out of it with the planet system.
In our solar system, these operations can be examined exemplaryly.
With the "Solar Orbiter" Esa has already approved a mission of the M-class (which is the budget at approximately half billion euros) for this question.
The Sunde will start 2017 and watch the surface and the A° of the sun exactly.
From great interest to researchers, they are also Jupiter and his moon.
They want to find out what role the Rice Planet has played in the development of the sun system.
For this purpose, Esa is the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision Programme.
The Sunde "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) starts their journey probably 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and will examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the demanded months of Europe, Callisto and Ganymed.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The World All offers many opportunities to study material under extreme conditions and to examine whether our natural laws are still valid there.
There may also be differences that could show the physicians the way to a new theory, including which all natural laws are united.
How has the universe developed, and why is it?
13,7 billion years ago, our cosmos came through the urknall.
Besides the material we are running, from the stars, planets and livestock as we are, there are dark materials, whose heavyness covers galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy, which makes the extent of the world's all.
So far the researchers do not know what physical laws in the first seconds breaks of the urknall were valid, nor are there worse dark material and dark energy.
With the "E" member, Esa has already allowed a M mission here, which is intended to start for 2020.
With a special telescope, the Sunde will first investigate the distribution of materials in the universe in the entire sky, allowing such returns to the acquisition of dark material and dark energy.
Who could do the run
From the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the election procedure.
The best opportunities for an approval as L-Mission have, according to many experts "E-Lisa", an approximate concept of the proof of gravitation sources.
It includes physician changes in the space time structure that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been pronounced until today.
Elisa could make it, hope the communities behind the project.
The mission provides one of two or three sons detector, which is stationed at all.
In contrast to installations on earth, he could also demonstrate gravitation waves that have occurred in Urknall and provide new knowledge about the creation of the cosmos.
Four additional proposals are still competiting on the second L mission: a large Röntgentelescope called Athena, which is to investigate "Icy Planets", another mission to the external planets of the sun system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" to investigate and investigate the earthly planets.
In addition, proposals for test-rock transport from Mars, for research of moon, Venus and Asteroids and for solar physics have already been excluded.
Snowden will be ready to cooperate with Germany in relation to U.S. monitoring
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US Secret Service, explained that he was ready to travel to Berlin before the German Federal Day when the National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not give answers to their A.
The German Deputy Hans-Christian Strobele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asylum received to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter of Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on the Friday of Strebels, he writes: “Although the result of my efforts was evidently positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a disruption and trys to criminalize political opinions with criminal threats, in which no defence is possible."
The truth is not crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the Government of the Government that the accusations would fall against him.
The accusations raised by the United States Justice Minister included the spionage and the steel of State property.
The German Internal Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to the time online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to enable it."
The relations between the United States and Germany are charged by the arms that NSA has heard the phone by Kanzler Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the lawyer of the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service, explained that it should be the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if it is possible, "without providing him and completely destroying the relations with the United States".
Strobele, a member of the Green, published a picture of himself and Snowden in Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists in Russia.
Strebelle explained that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA collaborator Snowden, Snowden cannot return to Russia when he leaves the country.
If Snowden states in Germany, he needs a certainty that he is "secure" there, as the deputy.
Snowden, in a letter, explains that he seems to be a "fair and continuing" persecution campaign that has destroyed him from his home.
However, he is affected by the worldwide reaction to “my act of political opinion”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-limited, as well as in the United States, have deployed the enthings on an uncontrolled system as a general service.
In a letter Snowden makes the German authorities a boat of cooperation, "if the difficulties around humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Frontier Airlines enhege fees for handpackets
Frontier Airlines plants to request up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to trust their flight pack.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of handpackets and 2⁄ for coffee or limonade, even if it was to read in the announcement at the middle week that passengers should keep the whole dose.
The new taxes are applied to hand packages in the pack over the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that 25 US dollars were calculated when the fees were paid forward, and 100 US dollars for travellers who first paid the flight.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the taxes of $100 are able to move travellers to take care of payment.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Flight companies began 2008 to request taxes for the first and second packaging provided.
Therefore, passengers trying to handle them have stopped as much as possible in the handpack, which results that the packages are often overflow over the seat.
Gifts are an opportunity to move passengers to take less with board.
O'Malley said the new tax isn't really going to deserve money.
It is about the most faithful customers of frontiers that would have clearly expressed that it would always be more difficult to find a place in the field over the seat.
Passagers who buy your tickets on the airport site do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the flight of frontiers may take a packaging free, but the next person must pay 100% for a comparable packaging.
O'Malley explained that the frontier website and check-in-process would be changed, so the passengers were informed of the tax before they came to the flight.
The new handpack of Frontier shall enter into force only in summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passagers often shipping on packages and other taxes, but flight companies are willing to take back.
They argue that the transport of the package should cost money and pay this service passengers if they want it.
In Wall Street, new packaging fees are considered as a sign that flight companies take enough money to cover the costs of flights after years of loss.
However, the majority leave the fingers of taxes for handpackets.
Spirit Airlines Inc. requested first taxes for handpacks three years ago and later followed the Allegiant Air, also a bilingue.
The only other flight company with such a tax is the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the Airline Breater Jay Sorensen, who carefully follows the additional taxes.
He appreciated in a report of December 2011 that the packing pack of the Spirit would introduce 50 million dollars annually.
Sorensen, who had a leader position in Midwest Airlines, was recently with spiritologists and was interesting in what would expect him at the flight, if passengers were confronted with the unusual pack fee of the company.
"The boarding process belonged to the lowerlyests I had learned in my carrier in the airport," he said.
I expected to see teethkins and manuscript discussions on the flight.
"The flight was filled," he explained, "and the board was as smiled."
Frontier also follows the Spirit in the 2th which are required for coffee, tea, limonade or saft.
The company explained that passengers, buying the limonade or saft, should keep the whole dose and coffee will be postponed freely.
Water is still free.
US Airways had recently tried to request money for refrigeration trees 2008, but it returned seven months later after passengers had been charged and no other large company was followed.
Frontier step to highlight taxes for the hand package if passengers do not buy directly with the flight company is the latest initiative to link customers to their own website.
Flight companies pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per purchased ticket.
This encourages all companies to move passengers to direct purchase with them instead of a online travel office.
Frontier has, however, been the most important in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive only a half of so many resources in the booking on a online travel office.
In the middle of the mile, the miles were decreased again to 25% of the flight lines.
A flight booked by a third offerer with a frontier of more than 1000 miles of clients is therefore only 250 miles.
passengers can also reserve outside when buying directly on the frontier site.
Frontier sees a faithful customer tribe to sit in Denver, but the business seats and the company loses money.
The redemption returned about 9% and the flight capacity broke nearly 13% in the first quarter, as it was read in the financial report, published on the middle week by the Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
The Republic has attempted to get the finance of frontiers in the framework of the company's sale.
Speaking Words From the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last breakfast of this year in the Christian church community Bisingen.
The subject of the day in the house of the congregation was "Speech words from the Bible" and "Speaks from the Mediterranean".
Zita Köhler, the president of the Church-Community Council, entered after the breakfast in a statement to the Bible speaking words.
"The word contains knowledge of life, rules or warnings," she explained.
She compared several words to the appropriate Bible verses and explained the importance.
She called speech words such as: woods be watchful, how the shoes fall out of the eyes, cast an eye on someone who gives the Lord in sleep, wash his hands in innocentness.
Sometimes the referendum also advised her listeners to what speech it was.
The speaking from the Mediterranean took place the church community mechanism Christel Dehner: All good things are three, blue, something decreasing.
She explained the meaning and origin of the talks that she called "break in the past".
A tombol was released until the end.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously written before they were transferred to the winners.
Under the surroundings of the breakfast round, the citizen candidat Roman Waizenegger was also mixed.
Learn Location unemployment: Pilot project for unlearned in tourism
At the Mecklenburg Seaplate, a pilot project for the tourism industry started.
Under the Federal Work Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as an student in the branch should be qualified over three winters to experts for hotels and guests.
"Now it is that the six-month courses end with conclusions," Carmen Wiechert said from the Working Agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefit is much: the participants would not be unemployment, the company's accommodation of educational experts, who have always lacked stronger in hotels and guests, and the Agency does not have to finance unemployment.
The project also shares the industrial and trade rooms in Neubrandenburg, as well as the German hotel and hostage association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg forwards.
NSA explains a "internal error" and not a hacker guilty on the web site
The estimated National Security Agency explained on the late Friday, an error laughed their public website for a few hours and not a hacker, as it was said online.
“NSA.gov was not reachable today for a few hours since an internal error occurred during a planned update”, said the Spionage Agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be raised this evening.
The statement that the outcome has been caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDOS) is not true.
In the early evening, online trackers found that the NSA website was not reachable for at least six hours and that is not yet available for some users.
Previously, a NSA speaker to ABC News explained that the sensitive internal network of the authority was "in no way" compromised.
The secret information is not inside, as the speaker.
At least a group of hacktivists took advice to have laughed the NSA website with a DDOS attack.
In such attacks, the target site will be overflowed with calls until the servers are overloaded and the website is joined.
Cybertaktika is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to enter the internal network of the target system.
The former super secret NSA, whose top name was once No Search Agency (no such authority), is in the light of the public, and looks at the enth’s enthings made in the past months on its extensive monitoring programme in strict criticism – a result of the secret NSA data which was stolen and published by the desillusioned former NSA collaborator Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service confirmed the initial speculation of the event today is the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of people without jobs is easily disturbed in October 22 to 1.307.
Although the quota with 3,1 Pro is better than last year and also better than in September, "We would have hoped more," says Monica Felder-Bauer, representative of the Agency for Work in Sunday.
Because many operations have been responsible for setting up.
One reason for this is that the fielder-buer says: "We have no experts in the handwork, health and old management."
Annual period of time has also been offered in the hotel and hospital offers since September.
In December, the winter season starts in the midst of December.
The entire background report can be found in the Universal Journal of 31.10.2013 (Page 33).
Income income in bombs after decrease in delivery payments and contracts
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-produced decrease of the net winning after he was under pressure by delaying orders and deliveries in aircrafts in the quarter and contracting problems in the railway party.
Bombardier with Sitz in Montreal also published no flight tests for his new CSeries aircraft and provided no new information about whether the flight could go to commercial use in September next.
On the juvenile flight of the test flight in a half months ago, only three other starts were followed, which can be questioned whether the test phase is running as planned.
The results remained behind the previsions and led to a course of more than eight Pro at the toronto bourse.
Cameron Doerksen, Anal to National Bank Financial, sent its assessment of "outform" on Thursday to "sektor perform" in order that the action in the next one to two quarters is a limited course potential.
"Where weak delivery numbers were expected in aircraft, but we are clearly disappointed from the development of the margins in the transport area," Dorksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test programme is progressing for the aircraft.
However, if no new orders are given in the coming months, we expect the market to be more skeptic against the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries Airlines can catalogue the company in the underground market segment, currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented in the public in March, and followed monthly delays first in September.
However, for CSeries, binding orders are moderated with 177, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the controls of the company relating to the cost-effectiveness and the cost-in-capacity of the new driving aircraft are relevant.
Currently, there are 403 orders and charges of 15 customers and companies.
President Pierre Beaudoin believes that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the Jet.
The business management also assured on Thursday to analysts and media that the programme is in the agenda.
“The test aircraft is not longer on the ground than expected,” Beaudoin said at a phone conference and added, while the location of the aircraft was used by boden tests and software updates.
Each manufacturer plants different.
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a revision period, which we have done.
That's happening during the whole flight program.
The second of five test aircrafts will probably be started in the next weeks, the remaining afterward, called the company site.
However, analysts remain skeptics whether twelve months after the first client's flight can carry out a CSeries flight.
Bombardier explained that it would verify the implementation planning (EIS) and will update it in the next months.
"The slow progress of the flight test – even though they obviously match the internal planning of Bombardier – strengthens our view that the introduction to the first quarter of 2015 is going on," Dorksen said.
In the quarter end of September 30, Bombardier's net wins fell to 147 million and 8 cents per action of 172 million and 9 cents per action in the year before.
The customised profit per action is 9 cents unchanged.
The turnover was low and falled from 4.2 to 4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a winning of 10 cents per action and a change of 4.56 billion, thus Thomson Re日s I/B/E/S.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer worldwide indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 in the last year.
The net orders fall from 83 aircrafts to 26.
The deposit in the air and space travel party was 32.9 billion and was therefore unchanged on 31 December.
"In the area of air and space transport, the results were set in our standards, but the low contract and market conditions were disappointing," Beaudoin said.
The turnover in the air and space traveling part was 13% of two billion.
Bombardier, the worldwide largest railway manufacturer, said that the turnover in this park was about 11 Pro to 2.5 billion.
The contracting stock in the transport party was 32.6 billion and was easily increased on 31 December.
The profits in the transport area have been affected by deployment problems in some large contracts.
According to business management, there will be new standards for the fourth quarter.
In the afterday trading on Thursday, the bombing action followed 8.5 pro, and was at 4.83 Canadians, as well as announced that the Google Financial Representative of Patrick Pichette would be changed to the subject.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the worldwide biggest commercial aircraft producers and bombs, reported a decreasing reduction in the quarter winning on Thursday.

Cocain dependent lawyer who warned the boss before police investigation must be in prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information on the sub-world size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer had made that his secret dependence could come to light
He was condemned by Liverpool Crown Court for three years prison
A criminal defendant, who warned a baron before a large police investigation because he had said that his secret search could be discovered, was condemned to three years of prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, sub-world size Neil Scarborough with sensible information on investigations about its A's trade after it was compromised by his own cocaine.
The first-classed advocate, "Bash", arrested by criminalists in 2011, was arrested in the house after the police had observed Scarborough, represented in a previous procedure.
The officers observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three cookies at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, La ́hasire, while he was with colleagues at a lawyer room's eating.
The investigations agreed that Ditta regularly consumed the class A after found in tests of cocain in his hair, on his cart and on credit cards.
In a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unlimited information about the arrest of two men in the order of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in the framework of a large investigation procedure for heroin and cocain trade in La日ashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
In combination with 32 other persons, they were arrested later after the police guaranteed a number of home investigations of heroin and cocaine in value of 1.5 million pounds and $200,000 pounds of money.
Ditta, 42, gave further information to the criminals because he feared that his dependence could be public.
Today, Ditta, who was found and condemned in the Liverpooler Crown Court for the office of Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn after a three-week procedure in two points of complaint for the prevention of justice.
In a previous question, he granted the owner of cocain.
The lawyer was transferred after the police in its investigations against Scarborough found that he had been regularly contacted with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigation officers followed the contemporary and saw how he went to Dintas house, and there was a cleanness of 60 Pro in a black golf handshot under the tone of the lawyer.
Shortly after he had delivered it, Scarborough regularly phoned with Ditta, who was at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football station in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, took up the own, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In the case of the Court, Ditta was a "regular consumption" of cocain after discovered in the tests of class A in his hair, his card and on his credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later, but he stopped taking cocain and said he had spoken to the courageous dealer because he was his man, and he claimed that their discussion was subjected to the "advocate secret".
During his imprisonment, Ditta took his letter box and tried to remove a series of credit cards, but they were assured and he was taken a hair sample.
In the police audience, he suggested that he operated a office and man would call him home because of legal matters.
In the case of the Court, he called for significant prisons and informed what the investigators knew about them.
State advocate Anne Howte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that we do not violate the law."
Thatta is accused of the misuse of his position as a criminal defendant because he has committed himself too much with certain men.
The questionary relationship is not simply the one of a trademaker, but the one who provides his lawyer with.
A part of his communications was without doubt legitimate because he was the lawyer of these people.
However, this was far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between a lawyer and Man.
He acted as far as possible against the police investigations so that they could continue to follow their crimes.
This is why Mr Ditta had his staff in committee.
He was too close to certain men, especially Scarborough, and he allowed it to compromise his independence.
Ditta showed every misbehavior and claimed: “If I was a corrupt lawyer that I was not, and I wanted to send information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but soon.”
However, after hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead said from the police in La日ashire: “Mr. Ditta has made the step from a criminal defendant to a criminal at the moment when he began to buy organised criminals.”
His cocaine dependence led to an unexpected compromise and made it acceptable for the motive of the leading members of the organized criminality who ordered him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Advocates must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
Ditta has left this confidence and has tried to disturb himself behind the fashion of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of La日ashire leaded to investigations against Ditta, which also led to a condemnation in three cases because of the possession of cocain and justice infringement, which underlines our deceit to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning for criminals and show that no one can take away the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years of prison after he had declared the deterioration of heroin, cocaine and canabis trade for guilty.
Femty-five more persons shared in trade were sentenced to a total penalty of 153 years for delicts.
On his website, Ditta published a area with questions and answers about it, where he indicated that his dream job was to represent a lawyer Man'en in the death cell in America, his final guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
In order to conclude the feasts from his 160-year-old existence, the Li’cranz Dunningen will replace two religious services with the "German Mese" of Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the "Rock my Life" Musical, which was enjoyed by the viewers in the early year of this year, the Liekranz will cover two religious services with the establishment of the German Mese of Franz Schubert.

Hasslave: Scepsis weighted in view of confidence
For example, with the wallets for the 2015 farmer decreat, the Haslach (SE) basic unit will change.
There is then only a common decree for all six pairs.
At a joint meeting, the institutions of Haslach, courts, Mühlenbach, fisherbach, Steinach and Welshstein were prepared for changes on Saturday.
Because the basic decisions of the dioxide are no longer to change and it is to implement the farming devices as satisfactory as possible.
During the day, it was particularly clear that the scepsia against the new weight was deeply weakening, but, in view of a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations to the renewal 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the farmer-generate, the extremely active discussions of the six bodies with the main officers of the Seal Organ.
The Regional Dekan Georg Schmitt presented the newest directives on maritime units in the Erzdiazee Freeburg on a presentation.
Afterwards, the SE Haslach as church community will become a body of the public law, which is involved in the rights and obligations of six individual church communities.
There will be only a common decree of farmers and a funding Council in which the Pfarrer's power is representative of the Office.
At least two selected members shall be represented from each pair, in which six pairs are designed to the community teams referred to in place.
Your task will be future to promote the church life in place.
The question of the financials of the individual farmers has then shown significant needs for interview.
The newspapers provide that collected goods remain in the pairs.
However, the commitments are over to the general community.
In the context of the largely planned investment, whose commitment to all the pairs then was greatly concerned.
"And in the past, it was only invested in projects that were able to be self-employed by the individual pharmacies," Haslach's relative President-in-Officer Bruno Princebach.
Practical experience with a common body for five pairs, Barbar Ritter, the president of the Gremie in the Shutterwald-New Unit.
They made themselves in 2006, "One will stay five" and they had to find that it wasn't so easy.
The institutions of the Haslacher Maritime Association were then responsible for answering the questions on the future composition and size of the common farmer community and the practical work of the Community teams.
The processes will be concretized at further meetings and will be held at a further joint meeting of all six institutions in the next early year.
At the end, Pfarrgeneral deputy Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Self-Organisation Unit, which was accepted with clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity is tougher
The citizens of Pfullendorf must be set up on powers.
As the town work manager, Jörg-Arne Bias, employed against the South-KURIER, is there a four-copper Pfullendorfer family 70 to 90 euros More per year.
A key reason for the current price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC environment of 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This circuit will be re-determined each year by the four operators of the large power travels.
These include the additions from the energy wheel which can be highlighted by an engineering over the electricity price.
The town works of Pfullendorf are the last member of this chat.
The Energy Company's Supervisory Board was even out of an environmental environment, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now the concrete sales should be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're going out of a highlight of 1 cent plus x," so bias, where the number is going to be closer to the 2 cents.
Ampel on Permanent Road: Wait for a waiting time
Sometimes a amp just won't be green.
The contact sleep in the street doesn't respond or the light mark is defect.
So what do you want to do - walk in red?
If a concerned has waited long enough on a red ample and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart legal lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
The waiting time, however, must be "adequate" which may be expressed differently in case of case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before it comes out of a functional stage of the ample.
But whoever continues the journey despite the red lights, it must be clear that he carries the full fault for an accident caused by it.
Whoever endures less than five minutes is not long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the ample after about three minutes and had to be responsible for a driving red light.
The apple was not defect, but runned a little later to green.
An prohibition of carrier remained exhausted because of the special situation - but not the penalty.
Communities are pleased with solid budget
When it comes to Community meetings on the budget, Mr. Ralph Gerster has a good laughing.
The community in Herdwagen Schönach has been well-aware and the administration has no longer known since 2005.
Moreover, the 2012 budget year can be booked as full success in this sense.
This was clear in the presentation of the year for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund stated, the administrative budget of approximately 7.6 million euros over a million euros was estimated as planned.
Moreover, the oversight of the administrative budget is about EUR 1.8 million over the approach.
In particular, the oversight of tax income and the share of the Community in the income tax shall be thanked.
In addition, the asset budget was clearly clearly over the planned values.
Instead of 1.5 million euros, he was 2.5 million euros in the past year.
"This is essentially in the adoption of the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
Since less investments have been acquired than planned in the 2012 budget, the recovery has also occurred.
In total, around 2.5 million euros could be increased at the total of EUR 4.9 million.
Master Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the work.
"That's a work you're not just shooting out of the brain," praised Gerster with a cut on the year.
He and the communities were probably glad for the good numbers.
It may sound paradox, but exactly these good numbers might be more deep to the citizens.
By means of the financial position, the community in the past was able to delay at high levels.
However, it says that Gerster has already been reduced by the country.
For these subsidies from various compensations, there are conditions.
In addition, the cities and communities, which are covered by the coverage, must specify certain hazards.
"We have to look at the theme of the importance, since in the next years investments are present for which we would like to pay advantages," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in Chor
With 60 years of singer, Hubert Wermter's story at the man's song Cácilia is almost double as long as the herb festival in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood as used in the colors of his man's song on the stage.
More than 60 years later, the song with the loved Chor still makes him great pleasure.
The Wermman was also active in the unit, including 28 years as member of the Committee.
For his commitment and his commitment, he received a number of exhibitions: Jörg Kohr, pastoral referendum in the mandate of the Cacilien-Stuttgart Rottenburg-Stuttgart, delivered him - because the Chor is also a churchchchor - an orchid of the defense and one of Bischof Gebhard Princes.
His song colleagues delivered him the origins of the German Chorverband and a graved zinc counter.
Besides the honor, the 31. holiday festival inhabited trains: With the MGV Betra, the Liekranz salt stetten, the Baisingen Baisingen and the local music association, the full-margins were loaded a large mixture of various audiences and anxiety styles, which had about 400 sugars.
The MGV fullmarging opened with voting songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Lustig, your brothers".
To your honourable song Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small stone - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundessing".
The men's songman Betra also sang classic cross-seeds such as "bailers" by Julius Wengert, "Wide, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the peoples' song "When you go through the valley".
The Li'kranz salt stetten provided with mixed Chor and his female group - the "Impulsor" - for the feast rates of women.
The mixed Chor led "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulsor" also returned to strange languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The Singer Department of the Baisinger Sportverein came with "What is the Swob?" from Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts "Bierlied" back to home films, where the fullmaringer Music Verein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small neighborhood program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore trollsteamer raised a casperl theater and read a few stories that the children were working well on midnight.

Kenyan pressure affected by controversial media law
"We are in a terrible situation, and we should ask ourselves, what does Parliament think of simply rejecting the judicial independence tomorrow?", was read in the magazine that holds the draft law not constitutional.
"The law is draconous and very punishing, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, business leader of the Capital Group, who also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most independent radioists and news sites Kenias.
He said that the new medium-trial “will always be taken because it is a prolonged arm of the government” and that restrictions on content and publicity would prevent Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the President listens to us and we call on him to reject this draft law and return to Parliament," he said.
According to the new Law, the Government takes “the media effectively in an offense” according to The Standard, the Democracy and the Freedom of Review in Kenya, and the design is“draconic”.
The derogation of the law consists of a series of measures to strengthen national security after the attacks by armed islamists on the West Gate income range in September.
The Chinese media are the wrath of the authorities because they published records of security cameras that were to see how the units sent to the tatort were deployed by the luxurous acquisition.
The police officer David Kimiyo responded to the introduction of two journalists and a leading media reporter, even if the reload was taken back after the media's shooting.
In accordance with the new law, media houses may be punished from up to 20 million kinesian shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the other risk of losing their reputable recognition or being excluded by an official press credition.
The Court also has the right to submit the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “only one penalty is able to force the most radio senders into the bankrot”.
Furthermore, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on their description of the "living blocks" Kenias.
If they offer the media to weight, they could do more unjustly what they want.
“No one will ever learn it,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist in the nation, who has the Chinese media as a decision-making factor in public life.
"If you leave yourself, they lead the country to the bankroot and return us to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.

The introduction of a wall for all Pkw would also be only a first step in view of Pronolds.
"There is the fact that at a later time the compensation for Germans will be charged," he said.

The festival meat will be located on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 p.m.
The new designed opposition clearly with a new coffee.
One that starts to be awarded and returned.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
As Dejà Vu, a psychological phenomenon, says Lexikon, is to have a new situation already raised or seen.
In the case of the same named coffee on the surface in the circle Cleve in view to the Rhein-Wall High School, it must not remain in the pure Déjà Vu-Gree.
The café with the beautiful name has exactly that for the purpose: a real residence is not just thankful, but always makes it experienced again.
Because it just makes fun and it's just beautiful.
A corner in the internal life of Opposition 8 gives the viewer a feeling of anhieb.
The high-modern, but not cool café environment looks like a place to feel good.

Daniel Büttner is the Expresso Fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappu ́no drinker.
"That's a bathroom - that's my thing," she delivers the NRZ.
Two events were already in the light coffee.
Better said one.
Because the festival of the gate found a place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring night.
The two 33-year-olds found "scan, and weird."
But not every man's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not a pronounced fan of events evening: "You can't even do it all right now."
And with a event I always speak only to those who are interested in the special event.
That is why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to make the entire normal operation as few as possible."
To say: Déjà Vu is also for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful environment on upload in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more to a gastronomy.
For the joy of many intelligents, the guests from near and remote, and the students who discover the gastromeil, and so also the Café Déjà Vu.

UN announces new objectives in combating poverty
The United States N’ start immediately with the development of a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development goals for the fight against poverty for 12 years ago.
In the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Guide, which began the evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the prevention of “sustainable development goals” that would replace thousands of goals in 2015.
They were included in the final projects of the document which will be decreased by worldpolitical leaders, Mrs Gillard.
The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon explained on the evening on the gipfel that the time was coming to "remember the national interests".
"I am glad that the Member States have agreed to take an attack on a process to agree with the universal, sustainable development objectives," he said.
“These objectives will develop on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the Framework for Development after 2015.
I will not strive to implement this mandate granted by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been without wins for four days, the handball overlightist continues to vote.
It doesn't allow Traa tomasz Malmon to doubt.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
However, I hope we finally won again.
"For I don't know anymore how a victory is like this," Malmon expects a successful life from his mastership at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the Tritliga Reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet split trees, Malmon has in the case warned the point finger.
Players I have trained myself in the A-Young.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their former coach.
"In addition, it is to be expected if there is still strengthening from the first," explains the SG coach.
The Malmon team must be increased in comparison with the past occurrences.
In front of all things in the covering work and the switch game, it was recently heavy.
In addition, the assessment of chances must certainly be better.
Therefore, I hope my players have finally got the head free during the short pause.
Safety thoughts in Mosambik grow in view of compatibilities between influenced personalities
Thousands of people gathered themselves in the centre of Maputos under the wakeful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state of founder and first president of Mosambique, to vote in a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
"We want peace again, we want stability," Vanessa de Sousa, a business leader of a investment undertaking.
In addition to the future of the country, she changed her business clothing against a T-shirt with the title “We request security” in Portuguese and joined herself on Thursday at the independence place of the capital.
Since two weeks, there are almost every day reports on compatibilities between government forces and Renamo that have been counted on the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a reasonable rebellion movement, which was initially supported by white Rhodesia and later the South African Apartment Government in the efforts to destabilise the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is not likely to return to a grown conflict, but the latest events of foreign investors and inhabitants have difficulted.
For the quickly growing economy is a lot on the game, because the discovery of great gases before the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investments from over 50 billion US dollars of companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the next years.
The Governing Frelimo Party, since 1975, the dominant force, and Renamo, each other, is guilty of the spending.
Renamo claims that the Government has caused the latest concerts by attacking her members in the region of Sofala, a traditional Hochburg Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels scaled, when government stripes attacked Renamo support points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, Renamos said speakers against the Financial Times.
The Government gives Renamo the responsibility for the coincidence and charges the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to undermine thoughts about instability.
In contrast with the AFP, the French news agency, he said in the middle of the middle-week that Dhlakama was viewed as a "loser" who wanted to "use all his remaining powers to prove that he could force the Government's decisions."
So Frelimo and Renamo show that they want to avoid a war.
However, the thoughts have increased since Mazanga has been quoted with the words, Renamo has concluded the 1992 peace agreement.
In contrast to the FT, he explained that it was not to respect the agreement anymore.
"Our vision is to be again negotiated and serious," Mazanga said.
Earlier discussions between the parties have only been able to take into account the spendings which have been established by a series of cohesions in this year.
"We have two raised men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) here, who joined the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, Do, at the open and Mosambique experts.
No one of them is good in negotiation and no one is ready to make the necessary consents.
Renamo, who is forced to reform elections, has already explained that she will boycott the communal elections in November.
Presidency and Parliament's elections are planned for the next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to move abroad, to affect the government's consents and financial benefits.
Renamos' election has been broken since 1992, while a newer party, based on a former Renamo member's Moviment Democratic de Mozambique (MDM), will probably improve the choices.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza, whose retreat, is to take place when his second official time ends next year, wants to decrease the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multiparties democracy, he does not want transparency choices, he does not want peace because he doesn't want the president's office," said Mazanga.
It is unexpected about what Renamo's capacity, but it has insufficient attacks on police and vehicles on a significant north-south connection.
Most of the fights found in the province of Sofala located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, where Beira is, but use the port, the mountain building forms such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of railways for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the streets.
Mazanga replied back to the question whether Renamo would repeat this train.
Renamo wanted “the international community to warn that things in Mosambique are not good,” said Mazanga.
Instability has yet increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, leader of Mediacoop, a independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, the tremendous progress in development and a recent outcome.
"The people think that the Government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions for the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrant, said that people just wanted stability.
"Nothing is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useful roads again," he explained.
Children should learn myths and legends as “exemples for life”, a author says.
The stories of Thor showed that “brutal force has no chance against intelligent tricks” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, the myths are “too wild, too anxious and in some cases to be taught at schools”, so Crossley-Holland placed for an “surely choice” older works.
"I feel wonderful that Mythen and Folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years.
He would also be able to make it possible for authors and teachers who were "too didactical" that children would "completely disable" because in underholding stories, the message would be "depreciated".
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from the Angelsachsian and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British People Tales, explained: “You can follow certain objects, but you should keep it as far as possible.”
Maybe the biggest difference between a wake up author who writes for awake, and a author who writes for children is in need to provide hope.
Not all must be simplified or lead to Happy End, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subsequently represented by the story, and it must not be explained.
That's the old story of the show.
Hansjakob goes again to freehof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob had his older seat in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years became alive in "Freehof".

Billy Sum-Hermann understanded incrediblely well to enter into the role of the sister and deliver her in Mimik and in the meantime of unfortunate life.
Between the individual games, the Mullenbacher played the selected music pieces and running the training.
In order to grant the honour of the citizens, Haslach's citizen Heinz Winkler gave the honor, who, in representation of the former official Heightich, made his expectation with a part of the city Council.
Their expectation then made the decay-singers, who called Hansjakob to the call: "But how beautiful it will be that youth records will live again at my own daily time."
With their song "O Jesuslein" they enjoyed the public in the freehouse as well as the storch daykinders with their words "Heraush, Out".
His criticism in the official Church had at that time expressed his thinking of the growth in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the home territory, behind his grave capelle on the burning at the court stands, he found his rest.
"A unsuspending spirit finally found his rest and was gone home forever," it called at the end of the scene game.
Applause and many praising words were from the public for the training.

Because Matthias Schrell has some other things on the place.
With the development of the Lower Axle Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to put on the coal imports for powers and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
As a result of the depth of 18,5 metres of the terminal form, the Capesize-Bulkcar can also be deferred here.
"In this year, we want to cut the 3-million tons marks," so shrell.
Besides the Eon furniture, the import coal goes to powerwork in the country.
When the GDF-Suez force work goes to the network, it's about 5 million tons of carbon imports per year.
The three vessels on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketballs despite the first download optimistic
Even the first delay in the Euroleague could not distort the big optimism in the basketballs of the FC Bayern München.
"No one can prohibit us to believe that also win the best European team of the past two years," Bayern Coach Svetislav Pesic added after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday at the Title Protection of Olympiacos Pirous.
We sent the message: Even in München there is basketball!
When he first arrived in the king's class, the monsters were very good, but they were simply not clear enough in the decisioning phases.
The guests were able to make a 15-point resting level 13 minutes before closing still to a car, before Pirates gave the game a wall again.
"We have undoubtedly struggled against the two-year Euroleague champion, but then made a lot of mistakes," said Bayern Professor Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most proclaimers of the Münchners, who in the first two parties against the Italian Serial Master Montepaschi Siena and the Poland Titler Zielona Góra were clearly winning.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up Comedy in America: Nearly a hundred years ago, the diversity artist Frank Fay began to be a conference in the Palace Theatre on Broadway to tell the amount of awesome in a form of speech.
During the years, Fays Innovation was built as recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
In life called and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival this year celebrates his jubileum with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“The majority of these headliners began to be at Carolines, and then they became more deep until they were sometimes to come into a club,” he said.
We have conceived this festival so that we can continue working with them.
In this year's event, there are events of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as of "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy advance for armed veterans in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the Festival, the world of comedy is also grown.
A number of comedians that share this year in the festival have become more unconventional ways, such as sending on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was with a Sitcom in the cable television (the ironic-sleeping Fantasy-football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sche-show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was both in “Saturday Night Live” and in “Parks and Recreation” part of the occupation, although it is the most for their viral video series “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On”.
As well as Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, race-related W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of the Comdy.
The largest magnetics of the festival belong to an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but was developed as a viewed television and movie director and a inof-in-the-comdy history.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a television sending with the title “St Down Comedy with David Steinberg” at TV Land.
The meeting is located in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitively in the Comdy DNA of Larrys's whole work," Steinberg said.
He told me when he's here, he sometimes goes through the street between two buildings and he thinks, "Hey, if I lose my whole money, then I may live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
The Iran appears to be satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next atom meeting with the five United Nations Vetomorths and Germany.
"In years there is now an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Party to clear the differences of the past years," wrote foreign minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
Although it would be a long way, the Atom Headshoper would be satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that, at the end, both sides would come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Kids kill game rooms with Machete
Two children have killed a 11-year-old one in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 years old boys invited their sacrifices to go with them to bird jail.
With power and masses armed, they excited the 11-year-olds on Saturday and cast the body into a source, reported the magazine "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played before their apartments in a worker quarter of football.
The body was found next night in Cerro Pelado, 15 km north of the exclusive Strand Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five-year sister of the disciples who had taken them should say that she was sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl before the police described the tathering without an attack against her, the two boys admitted the previous murder of the 11-year-old.
As a result, the elder called a rivality in the football game.
He was temporarily entered into a psychiatric youth.
Attendee must be in prison
The Court of Justice has condemned a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three-and-year prison because of human trade, accessory, threat, disturbance and annual disorder.
The former Federal Soldier, who, after two units in Afghanistan as a doorstock, described a guest within a processing process.
Then, in five cases, he met women about Internet or phone contacts, which he sent to the strike after a few weeks.
The opposite, he refused to break with violence and distress.
He kept the income of women who have created for him in part for a year.
By confission of phones and SIM cards, he underlines women's contacts to the outer world.
Along with a colleague who delivered the women, he held them in various bordels in the southwest.
There he allowed them to be monitored in part to control their income.
In the case of the Court, the complaint claimed that he was suffering under a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan came near him in an explosion of life.
After a psychiatric expert was a great doubt on the psychological restriction and thus affected a limited illness, the 33-year-old was a comprehensive question.
The Court had no more to understand the damage of women.
As reported by a Kripo officer, at least four other cases of human traffic could be detected after a first display by telephone monitoring measures.
The hearing discussions were undertaken by high aggression.
In later statements, the damage would have occupied her martyrium.
Another Witness in which one of the women in the whole body had discovered blue flocks has not made a statement until today.
It is "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploiting in this meter seems normal.
The complainant suffered his behavior yesterday.
"He solved himself from these circles and wanted to lead a whole normal life after prison," he said.
Oil price continues up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price was also continued on Friday, after the concern of a high boat was overtaken by a report, in which the energy-production sector of China was w.
The reference oil site for deliveries in December was fallen on 14 cents at 96,24 USDs per barrel in Europe late morning in the electronic trade at New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which means a price fall of 5,8 Pro in October.
The big oil offer has charged the prices in the last weeks.
The United States Energy Ministry stated at midweek that the US offer had increased by 4.1 million barrel last week.
In five weeks, the ship was cut about 25 million barrel.
However, on Friday, there were indications on a stronger query by two reports on a Shuwach in the Chinese production.
This includes a continuous recovery of China's economy, whose growth was increased to 7.8% in the quarter, after it was reached at the lowest position in the previous quarter since two years.
Roh oil from the type Brent, a reference value for international roh oil, also used by US raffinies, fell in the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to 108,58 USDs per barrel.
Judge blocks decision on the stop and fresh guideline of NYPD
A Federal Court in the United States blocked on Thursday the adoption of a judge requested amendments to the Step-and-Frish Programme (‘Stop and Research’) of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second United States Procurement Court explained that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be made until the city was decided.
In August, the judge had judged that the city was violated against the Constitution in the way the programme for detention and interrogation of persons would be implemented.
The city introduced a vocation against its appreciation and the assigned deficiency measures to set up a supervisory body to the police to amend its Directive and the appropriate training programme.
The Court of Procedure heard the arguments for the requested exemption on Wednesday.
The professional report explained that the judge must be removed from the case because she had violated the behaviour code of the US judges by providing a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly based on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly reacted to the criticism of the Court.
The Court had judged that police officers violated the rights of ten thousand people because they were inappropriately targeted by black and latin American men with the stop-and-fresh programme.
She designated an external body to monitor the implementation of major amendments, reforms in Directives, training and service surveillance, and organized a pilot program with the body's cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York was ready to stop the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were released after a control by the police.
A mental debate on the town's vocation was planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisch tactic was criticized by a series of civil law offenders.
The controls of this kind have been in different forms since years, but the number of open controls has increased during the time of the partyly citizen Michael Bloomberg's office to a total-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and latin American men.
In 2004, four men who listened to all minorities made a complaint that developed a collective complaint.
In order to make changes in the NYPD stop-and-fish programme, the changes will end unfair practices and create a more reliable and more effective police, and to influence the way other police preliminaries apply the rule.
In contrast, the changes would be the moral of the police but not the criminality; it would also lose money and not solve the larger problem of a police, which, after the loss of thousands of places, was under pressure in the last year.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-fresh practice, which was constitutive, but only reform the way of implementing controls by the NYPD.
Happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is a oase that only dreaming camels
With this beduin evidence, the first president Wolfgang Henne described the story and fascination of the "Helping Hands".
On Saturday Wednesday, the birthday of the United Nations was set up, which could already show significant success.
The first Chairman Henne reported completely the work of the United Nations.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in the Chejk-Zajed disease house in Nouakchott in 2004.
Following this, another cooperation developed, and the Gyn·lox Henne conducted numerous operations on several travels.
In the currency of the talks, images from the units were shown on a large wave, so the guests of Jubilee event could make a picture of the actions mentioned.
The wilderness vehicle of the United States was also shown.
This is an ancient federal protection vehicle.
Ra _BAR_ Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to arrange this vehicle with a photo-installation and now, as mentioned in Henne, to be active in advising function.
In 2008, the room Schleeh from Baiersbronn made the hospital station in Socogim, a quarter of distress at the border of the capital, in the record of almost a week.
She also experienced a new mother-child disease in Nouakchott
Before interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be rationalised.
Many in Africa are learned as medicals, such as Henne, for example depreciation against Burn-out.
Because of the political disasters in the country, it was not possible to take so many travels as planned, but many medicals came to Germany to visit here in different areas.
○ Containers are regularly sent with material to Africa, so in March this year, medical equipment, medicines, bond material, hospital beds and brilliants.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself offered rich local colors by relating from Mauritania from rebuilt to the mobile goat of Mercedes and drawing the experiences of the stam home musicians, who traditionally understood the United, when they traveled in Mauritania.
As his personal movement, he named his work in the field of accounting as young deputy.
When he became aware of how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help the Africans in control of a budget by the people.
○ Football emphasised that the global economy also requires global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It's not far to Africa from Gran Canaria.
Coulson has set a phone hacking to check a tip
The earlier news of the Word publisher, Andy Coulson, appeared to have “phone-hacking, monitoring and confrontation” in trying to visit a false tip on a business of the former internal minister Charles Clarke.
State advocate Andrew Edis QC explained to the Court in the Old Bailey, News of the World heard a mistakes in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special adviser” Hannah Pa日by.
The magazine ordered the Detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack the Vocemails, and followed them, but Coulson also called her and left messages as the court had learned.
"As for the state advocate, Coulson, who is now the issuer of the NotW, no one who is before the apartment of people and hopes to take it in fresh fact, but one who wants people to face a story to see their response," Edis explained.
He said that NotW uses three procedures to research stories: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The issuer is personally shared in the method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, monitoring, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He disputes this, but we say, "And if he knew it."
Reviews about a business Clarkes were first attacked by the feature editing of NotW when a source that was sexually interested in Paıby was said: “Do not disturb your time, she is with Charles.”
A band with voicemails by his phone by at least three occasions was guaranteed in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, on which Paıby and their sister were stored as "project".
At the time of the research, the grandparents received anonymous calls from Paıby, where they were asked for information about them, explained Edis.
The former Chefreporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup observed the monitoring of the movements of Paıby.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow I want to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson A ́s in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as the former internal minister David Blu.
The gentlemen heard on Thursday that Coulson Blu ́tt faced a business with a married woman when he himself was lied to the complainant Rebekah Brooks who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks strive to get away with others, to shoot phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have given the phone hacking.
From the protest against the planned rich tax, the French Fussball has actually carried out the first strike since 1972.
An explanation meeting ends unexpectedly.
In the conflict of rich taxes, the Government and the Professor Fussball in France have been manipulated after a failure to make a sackgase.
Although President François Holland received a representative of the United and Federal Representative in Paris on Thursday in the Palace of Elysée in Paris and listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to revoke the Fusball from the 75-provised income income planned by more than one million euros per year, which would have been able to cover all the companies of the country for two years since 2014.
The opposite also remained heavy.
The strategy announced for the end of November will also be carried out, and the Chief of Professional Association (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, shared with.
Thus, between 29 November and 2 December, the games set out in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are expired.
Assessments: No absolute protection possible
"We want to engage the inhabitants early in the planning," Mr. Jens Höußler opened the civil information process for highwater protection concept in matters.
80 participants came to the community Hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express thoughts and to introduce ideas.
Heußler explained: "The final decisions fall from the members of the Community."
The highwater, which appeared on 15 May 2009, was unprepared, was an incrociative event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, as well as the hosts.
A fluid area investigation was granted with the neighborhood Aidlingen, which is now based on the high water protection concept in cases.
"The protection of many babies is the best possible target," as Heusler.
The planning of protection from a German weather service is based statistically every 100 years to expect highwater.
The climate change will be taken into account by a 15-procent advantage.
This is included in sections with "HQ 100aKlima".
The watermasses that led to significant damage in 2009 resulted in a 1000-year highwater.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," as he said.
In order to achieve the protection of the HQ 100aKlima, about four million euros must be invested, while the community can be estimated at approximately 70%.
However, he pointed out that it would only be helped if a general concept was implemented.
To this end, the assembly is designed to contribute to the citizens.
An extensive planning and approval procedure should be resolved.
In the best case, the implementation can be started in 2016.
In addition, the protection concept already presented in the Community in the last week (we reported) of local measures in the effort of the River Irm from the Stammhouse valley.
In addition to the presentation of the highwater protection concept, the participants used the opportunity to introduce their claims.
In addition, it was questioned why no longer planned depths and detentions to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, the expert of the commissioned Engineer office forest and corbe from the hillsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needs the summary of all proposed measures to achieve the desired goal.
Furthermore, you are maintained to find the most economic solution, such as Joachim Wald of Ford and Corbe.
Inmute was in the alternate place, which even in normal whirlwinds were still suffering under a overload of the channel network.
The problem has been taken in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, the Commission noted that the directives for channel systems are other than for highwater protection and this should not be mixed.
The community is committed to determine the channel network so that rain events may be strengthened two-three-yearly.
To increase the size of the waste water channels, millions would decrease.
Severe damage after coincidence
On the early Friday afternoon, on the road 44 near Revensdorf, two car car cars were severely hurt in a frontal association.
The police locked the street immediately, but it could say little about the accident.
However, there are various witnesses that should be evaluated first.
The 19-year-old Leglierin of a VW Golf went to Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from gettorf met her with Hyundai.
Both vehicles joined together, while the woman was so hardly attached that the firewall nearly needed a half hours to free her from the vehicle.
The accidental cause remained unclean.
Both injury happiness came to nearly placed hospitals.
The street remained closed about two hours.
It could be called the US Dostojewski.
Philip K. Dick was a god-sucker, a metaphysician, his Romans and stories have some series.
Inflammating the family in the outside: the stinging eyes, the bart, the high stars.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is to understand with massive oeuvre as the founder and Apologet of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as prophets of the Ananian prophets, which apply to something in his own country.
Some titles have occurred in the Heyne Storage, the Haffman's cassette with the 118 stories; two thousands.
Dick explains America - the kingdom of the breathing technical progress, along with Paranoia, security and faith, to be chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his latest books are read as a mixture from the revelation of John and a computer-manual.
Maybe he was crazy, he had been added to the brain.
He realized, soon, that the computers are divinity.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person distinguishes from a machine, the Creator of the creation.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired films such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verheeven and Steven Playberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "minority report" comes from 1956, he streams the Church of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
It is developed here the principle of the "pre-krimin", "Pre-Crime", so what is between more or less of official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, who looks like our terrifying, mutants look in the future - and the police is going on.
"We recognize individuals who have not violated any law," says the leader of the Authority.
"We'll catch them, even before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "There are no sword offenders in our society, we have a penalty full of pesudo-breakers." They read time streams.
They assume that bad things are happening, and prevent the criminal thoughts to be implemented in the fact.
Dick's story works like the blue pause for the anti-Terror Gesetz and the audience of the NSA.
Anti-emotion of the attack: Thus also works Obama's Drohnen-Philoso and Praxis.
But Dick's story isn't done yet.
The police officer complains that there is no further division of violence, the military controls the everyday - and the rest of the State.
Then the supervisory will be monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system's running through.
It's perfect, but it's.
It finds its own conditions.
It takes irritations and sacrifices not only in purchasing, but it builds up it.
The system makes the fighting.
Philip K. Dick means reading, always again, getting the truth closer.
Explain railways on labels in Russia
The former American Secret Service Expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German Federal Advocate could either ask for writing questions or take the 30-year-olds personally in Russia, reported by the Interfax Agency.
Earlier, the Green Bundesday Deputy Hans-Christian Snobbles found the first German Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the business.
NSA end-up processes strengthening company paranoia due to State monitoring
On a mild day the end of August, a German police officer flew deeply over the United States Consulat in Frankfurt, the capital of Germany.
On the direction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism (BVT), of the German Internal Secret Service, he should photograph the box of the US outside post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the existing existence of monitoring tanks and the action led to a change of words between the United States and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
Jameseusepper, the US Director of National Intelligence, repeatedly said in September that the United States had no possibilities for the foreign pioneering to “streat the secrets of foreign companies in the US firms in order to develop their international competitiveness or their winning”.
However, since Edward Snowden, who has become a single worker who has become whistleblower, has started the publication of his Führerhorn to US monitoring secrets, governments and business leaders have no longer been sure whether they can take the Director at the point.
Reports that the National Security Agency exposed the Brazilian Olfirma Petrobas and provided data from the Cloud Provider of Google and Yahoo have brought the company paranoia to a new maximum level due to State monitoring.
The fass to overcome enthèering that Kanzler Angela Merkels was connected with the phone, possibly for years.
If the most powerful person in Europe is able to advise visors, there are also potential objectives for business guides.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible to use these data for mutual benefits.
"The Germany must wake up," says Oliver Green, president of the BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
Dutch companies believe that the United States now have put a nearly large risk as China when it is about industrial pioneering and data steel, such a survey published by the EY advisory form in July.
However, in the documents submitted by Snowden, there was no evidence that the United States had transmitted the secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
More concerned have expressed that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependency from the United States.
Undertakings are skeptic.
The Bundesday was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly again...
"It doesn't work," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong IT industry, you should not have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subventioned from cars to agriculture.
Everything until the IT border.
Nevertheless, raffination and technical raffinations of the U.S.A.-spionage companies covered by Snowden enths have been shocked, which had previously seen the biggest spionagery risk in China.
In Cloud Computing, there is a big change, since the business leaders now are more conscientious that data are undertaken of the legal practice that is stored in the United States and are therefore potentially acquired.
According to one of the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institutions, who have been conducted after the enthings on the American Data-Mining A with Prism about ○ Pro of the not-EU members' plans to use an Ananian supplier.
Jim Snabe, a representative of SAP business leader, says: "We see a new question of customers that don't exist a year ago – it sounds: Where will my data be saved and you can guarantee that this physically remains in this legal room?"
Dutch business leaders represent the view that the latest reports simply visited only what they knew, namely, that powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets and that they must therefore be observed at all prices.
It is not surprising that economic spionage is located.
That's all right.
"It was a subject for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current debate," Kurt Bock, President of the Chemical Undertaking, says BASF.
The Americans spy us at commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in national interest to defend our companies.
The management of the business does not usually refer to the oppositions you have taken because it provides profits.
In large companies, employees have long been reported that taking a free USB stack on a mess or the unconserved lying class of a laptop in the hotel room is not advised.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a representative member of the car manufacturer Audi, says that it belongs to the standard practice for years before a present meeting to collect the phones so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BVT advises leaders to use simple prepaid hands when they go on foreign travels because artphones may be compromised.
The Prepaid hands are removed behind.
However, there is anxiety that small and medium-sized enterprises remain attachable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are worldwide market leaders in the respective neck.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often missed experience, staff and financial resources in order to ensure effective operational secrets against unautorised access”, warns the BVT in a report.
The United States warn their own companies against economic spying through other countries.
According to Washington Post, in the United States National Intelligence Estimate was appointed in February France, Russia and Israel behind China to two of the countries used to buy economic data of hacking.
A member of a German Blue Chip undertaking agreed when it is to be an economic spionage, then “after the French the worst”.
Bernard Squarcini, former leader of the French Internal Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The secret services know very exactly that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against the terror, spy their associates.”
Highlights: Measure answers to wedding questions

In gentlemen, it is dominated with western and plasma, but it can also be selected creme colors or brune combine.
If it is important to select the local, it was explained.
Smockless neighborhood rooms are not optimal, the environment should be particularly.

Parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in a tragedy accident, believe in murder
The parents of the teenage, whose body was found in a joined ringmat in his high school tournament, are convinced that her son was killed, the lawyer of the family explained on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the United States Federal State of Georgia was found on 11 January in a highly established Matte behind the tribe in the school.
The investigation officers of the sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragedy accident, but the 17-year-old family doubts.
"You are convinced that your son was killed," Benjamin ́mp, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, said against FoxNews.com.
You never thought he was dead as the sheriff had concluded.
"You are thinking that any logic occurs, violates the laws of physical and healthy human understanding."
Moreover, they are convinced that the truth will be stumbled to smite the person or persons who are responsible for the death of their Son.
"Your son went to learn to school and returned to the body sack," he commented.
US State lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday, there will be a formal investigation of Johnson's death, since a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death leading to a crime?
This explained Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the way they also lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I represent the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy pointed out that Johnson was distorted on the consequences of a "positional deterioration".
However, a second autopsy has proved another cause of death, such as Moore.
"There are a number of questions to be answered or employed," he said.
Moreover, if there are sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation of Johnson's death, he will be responsible for the FBI with the implementation of investigations.
One representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not immediately prepared for a comment on our request on Thursday.
A Court of Justice in South Georgia claimed that the authorities should release all monitoring videos that the investigators have checked.
The teenage parents said they hoped that the video records contained indications about how he was dead.
CDC Allergy Guidelines for Schools
In the middle of the week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of directives for the treatment of food alergies of children in schools.
These are the first directives that the US Government has issued, since the number of school-related children with food alergies increases.
One of the 20 children in the United States has a foodalergy.
The distribution of food alergies among children has increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The Guidelines contain information for schools that will lead to awareness of food alergies during the teacher and the employees and how to handle children showing allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools provide Epinephrin – the auto-injection of the EpiPen mark is most frequently used – to meet a potential mortal surprehensive reaction.
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can epinephrin easierly preserve.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called children who show an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels like something in my tongue," "My tongue feels as if a hair lies on it" or "My tongue strikes".
Parents of intersexual children can choose "undetermined sex"
Germany is the first nation in which a generation is recognised for children who were born with unexpected genitals.
The newborn is no longer awarded men or women.
In accordance with the new law, parents have no more sex to declare for such children, but they may be able to specify "undetermined" or "not set" on the birth courses.
The objective of the Law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not need to take overlooked decisions in relation to sexual addictions to newborn and fight discrimination of intersexual people.
A intersexual person said, BBC years later, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I'm keeping the flick work that was created by doctors and full of narrows.
Unfortunately, one of the 2.000 children comes not as a boy or as a girl every year.
They belong to the intersexual, a group falling under the diagnosis “Sexual Fisheriation Station” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypic chromosomes, kidneys (equipments or heads) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson was probably intersexual.
The understanding of sexual identification has not yet been very well developed, but most experts in the United States suggest to use the best available information on sexual addiction, if it is impossible, and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before you decide for a operation, if you are at all.
The New Yorker Psychiater Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialised the problem of sexual identification, said the new German law "sounds after a good thing".
Intersexual children represent a ethical dilemma.
"Many people have life threatening diseases that require a chirurgical attack, but most children do not apply it," he said.
You can take a sexual adoption without operation and then wait for the development of the efficiency.
The scientific data about how a child develops his sexual efficiency are not very precise.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It's like the secret, why people are homosexual.
In a report to the European Commission of 2011, intersexual persons are distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons because their status is not sexually related, but is conditional by their biological constitution, which is not exclusively men or women, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in advanced sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, brush and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as continuing organs and genitals, or in chromosomostructures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination that intersexual and transgender persons are exposed in professional life, as well as of the measure of disappointment, violence and prejudicial crime.
Unlike the sex picture, boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible to specify a man, a woman or a "three generation".
In June, Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognised as the first "sexual" person worldwide after a court had been allowed to maintain a "not-determined" sex status.
Near M and W German statements have a future assignment, X for intersexual, such as the Ministry of Intersection.
In the neighboring France, gender topics are still conflicting, as a message to France 24.
Duties of French members of the strict Catholic country in 2011 a petition to remove the “sessional theory” from school books.
The American Catholic Online website also spoke against the German Law, with the reason: “If the world is cut into a new state where the sex is a decision, but not sexal A, we turn two other columns of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to the baby Zone that she felt better when babies were assigned a sex at birth.
"It is also stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she said in the parent website.
Children need stability and safety.
Historyly, children who were born both with male and female sexual parts were observed as Hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God, who had both generations.
Age ago, the medicine considered the sex as something that could be eliminated and then rebuild.
In the meantime, however, the ethical bases of a operation will be doubted after now, how complex the sexual activity is, and that doctors can also lay wrong because they don't know how the child feels when he rises with the sex assigned to them.
“In the middle of the 20th century it was called a “psychiatric emergency””, said Drescher.
When such a child was born, it was not called the psychiater but the chirurg.
The dominant theory about the treatment of children with unexpected genitals is returned to Dr. John Money from John's Hopkins, who seemed that the sex is formable.
He expressed the term “sexuality” and argued, social and environmental attitudes – such as parents learning a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and said whether a person seemed to be men or women.
However, in a case under the title “John/Joan” from 1966, his theories were contrary.
He struck the parents of a boy whose penis was distracted in a disrespected circumcision to cast the child completely and to remove his heads and then to take him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as an example of a conversion which he did not," so Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he turned back to men and married a woman.
But by 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher says that there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, the survivors of these sexual operations have come to the public, which are "not happy with the result".
So about Jim Bruce, a 36-year old author from Montana, who was born with XY-man chromosomes, but two-double genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large client or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “comprehensive life ” as a man.
So his external organ and the Hoden were quickly removed chirurgically after the birth of 1976 and he was grown up as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unfortunate, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But as he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked his medical acts.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilised at my birth – and no one has ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD which could not produce enough testosteron to develop genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed to men, received testosteron injections and left his breasts.
By the operation, he has become unfruitable.
Today, he fights for others in a organization named Interface Project to view intersexual people as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, the business leader of the advocates for Informed Choice in California, is concerned that the German law can "for the exhibition and stagmatization".
“Too many activists are concerned that the German decision might encourage parents to make quick decisions and to grant a child ‘not established’,” she explained.
We're afraid that it will favor interventions.
We think it'd be better to give men or women the sex and then to wait.
However, we do not know how the law will be affected, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization understood the Australian Law, because “they are allowed to wake up to recognize as a gender”.
"Work should be able to make own decisions about their legal sex," she explained.
The German law is about the assignment of birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this time.
When they are wake up, they can decide themselves over their body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual difference and supports hundreds of others in a group of self-help, says that the German law is "completely powerful" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with men's chromosomes, but a DSD named "complete Androgen Resistence".
Because of the recept effect of the target cells for testosteron, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no eggs.
Today Katie 29 is married and married; she is at the Property of Pennsylvania as a worker in the child psychiatry.
As it is unfruitable, however, it hopes to be able to get a child by adoption or a mother.
"The law gives parents room, which does not make decisions overwhelmed," Baratz said.
It provides time for them to make different tests and clothe things and gives them such time before they write "man" or "women".
In this way, everything's okay – you're getting the child big and swiftly.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy your parents' lucky.
And you must not overcome a operation that does not allow it to turn away.
"This includes the children in the decision with and removes the parent's ambition because they believe that they would not do the right," she said.
Lastly, the child decides about the gender that is better matching him – and that is wonderful.
Thus, children will be able to make the decision themselves.
Unknown hurt girls by shooting out of the car
Unknowns have hurt a twelve-year-year-old in Sachsen.
On Thursday, the workers were injured in Genthin with air pressure weapons on a group of children.
That shared the police in Burg.
The girl was easily hurt at the left wave.
Saving forces put the girl in the hospital.
The shooting came from a small car that passed by a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
The Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The staff also shot into a bus holder.
A boat broke.
Then they went away.
The criminal police was determined, called it on Friday.
To this date, the police inspection can look back to a safe Halloween night.
The officers were only invited to egging children twice, who cast them against households.
Since the householders recognized this and removed the egg residues at the same time, there could also be no saxshades.
Moreover, in the city area, some silvesters have been burned, but there is no shame.
A resident in Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his pkw was developed with clopapaper and his advisers were disappointed.
By the time of the police meeting, however, the man found his advisers in the nearby, all again, so the police did not have to continue to act.
Living with Future Perspectives
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives dreaming.
Your house is located in a safe dwelling of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, good neighbors, and not too much.
In the city there are only a few minutes with public foods.
"I hope you don't have a stuck before the shoes?" Waltraud Ries asked and pointed on a fat spin on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how hard this is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spider phobie, but anxiety, in the age the many steps to the house and in the apartment, explains she.
Furthermore: Since a Meniskus operation, the middle fifth cigarette has needed to learn what it means to move with a handicap of stopping to stopping.
Recently, a book of her has been published to the theme 'Happy to live in the age - What is the best form of living for me?'
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on in the old age' she begins to tell.
When she and her husband moved to the maid apartment for more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks different about it.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are at all with the theme 'Life in the age'.
Most of them disturb it as long as it goes.
They're always older than the other, she's saying,
Only if the pressure of suffering is really big, think about it.
'Then it can be too late', so Ries.
In its book, the internal architectin presents 17 models of residence for a separate residence in the age.
"What a living form you choose is always a individual decision," she explains.
D i e solution is not given for the age.
Even those who are able to have an older seat in Toscana or the Bretagne should always assume that he can be sick.
And: 'Unless knowledge of the country is also compatible in Dolce Vita', it gives the physician to think of volunteers.
Their models include classical monitoring models, alternative residence forms or the often quoted Rentner-WG.
At the age, everyone has his ticks and macks
"For me there would be a community like that but nothing," she means with an eyewater.
Not like in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
"In the age, you just need his backing rooms," so Ries.
However, that an older community can work, the book does not want to exclude.
But then it must be different than in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest, you believe it.
With this view, it is not at least in the country headquarters.
'The majority of the old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment' is also the experience of Theresa Ruten, the leader of the civil service of the age of the capital.
Your service consults people around the theme 'Be older'.
Therefore, older people would often also take inconveniences and restrictions in purchasing only to remain in their habitual environment, that is also the experience of the funding warnings.
There are many opportunities to make the house or apartment free today.
Ries recommends that everyone who works with the ancient rebuilding of their home or their apartment only once reasonably inform himself and not to be responsible for the first worker.
Today, there are also specialists for the older rebuilding.
Even in the apartment, this will be realized by one or more, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the internal architectin is opened.
But not always the existing apartment can be converted and thus be free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Inside the apartment, you could install a step air, which would also be the greatest obstacle with steps to the apartment gateway.
She will continue to search until she found the ideal object for her and her husband.
Before the moving, she's more than before the spring at her apartment gate.
United States wants to continue persecuting Snowden criminally
The United States have not changed their attitude to the former US secret worker Edward Snowden.
He will continue to have transmitted unleavened secret information.
Therefore, if he had to make a criminal procedure in the United States, the speaker of the US Foreign Minister, Jennifer Psaki, said in Washington.
Even the latest statements of Snowden would not change it.
Previously, the German Green Policies Hans-Christian Snobbles after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow had invited the United States to not further threaten him with punishment.
Psaki emphasised that it was a cruel statement of a Parliament and not a German Government member.
Secret Services of Edward Snowden is essentially prepared for a conversation with the German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This cleared the former NSA employee who was searched by the United States in a non-addressed letter sent by the Green Policy Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and to the Federal Government, the Federal Day and the General Federal Lawyer.
The writing has the following text, after one translation spread by stumbles:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your research on mass monitoring.
I'm Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contractual or direct as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I became a Witness of systematic law violations of my Government, which led me from moral obligation to act.
As a result of the publication of these thoughts, I saw a severe and persistent herd that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I live now in the exile and enjoy a periodic asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation under international law.
I'm disappointed by the resonance to my political action, both in the United States and in the other place.
Citizens around the world and also high employees - the United States - have enthusiasms to a system of overall monitoring, which is not eligible for any account than a public service.
These spionage enthings are a number of proposals for new laws and directives that aim to the formally covered misuse of public confidence.
The benefits of the society from these knowledge obtained will become more clear; at the same time, the risks in purchasing were significantly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was evidently positive, my Government has treated this as a faithful breakdown and strive after criminalizing political opinions and putting accusations.
However, the truth is not a crime.
I am convinced that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will deal with this negative attitude.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are faced, I will be able to share me in the responsible statement of the experts in relation to the statements in the media, in particular as regards the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriate and legally.
I am pleased to talk to you in your country, soon as the situation is completed, and thank you for their efforts to maintain the international law that affects us all.

Child Garden found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's citizen Michael Maier.
The former child garden in the Garden Street has bound the commune to a person.
At its latest meeting, the Community agreed to the sale in the non-public part.
The building changed his owner to a "admissible" price.
"The community is satisfied," states Mayer.
100 000 euros were employed in the budget.
It is still not clear how the new owner wants to use the previous child garden.
The citizen is right that winterling has given the responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else, and thus no longer needs to come up for the entertainment of the house, how to hide, watch the garden and clean the road.
"This approach is now away," maybe Mayer's happy.
Place concert at high-some temperatures
The Music Verein Hammer Airway Bach provides a place-concert on the terrace of the Gashouse Hammer.
When director Bianca Willmann has the tactstock at 19.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammricher Musicians.
The president of Manuela Honeck presents the music pieces.
Honeck thanked in this framework all those who had helped to order the first musical shock.
Report: Obama campaign decided to replace offers by Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers of President Barack Obama have considered in secret to replace Vice-President Joe Biden in the election fight in 2012 by Hillary Clinton, as the New York Times.
The enthungs is the most appreciated surprise of the long expected work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the election fight 2012, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times presents an exemplar of the book appearing at the day of Thursday, and she reported that the President's top advisers would have carried out “increasing group meetings and investigations at the end of 2011” to find out whether it would look better for Obama's quicking hope to reelect.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political co-respondent of the Times, the book considers the history of the efforts of leaders of the campaign and the White House, particularly the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect it has on the investigation values to change the former foreign minister Clinton against the vice-president.
The potential exchange was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and Oval Office.
Only half a half of the closest advisers of the president – Daley, the former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and the former leader of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the advanced exchange.
In Duble Down, Daley has been at the top of the efforts to exchange offers, despite its "een, personal relationship" before it disappeared against such a shocking train, after the data showed that the Clinton's candidate would not improve the opportunities of Obama.
In an interview with Martin, Daley was aware that the government actually decided to replace Bides by Clinton.
"I expressed a whole series of things that were to be put into account, and that was one of them," Daley explained to the magazine.
It must be reminded that the President had at that time fearful investigation values, so we thought, "For God's will, what are we doing?"
When Daley was insulting the investigations as “bound careful”, Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign was committed to re-electing a significant approach to find out whether such trains would be paid to the elections.
"In campaigns there is not so much money for research and focus groups if you are not seriously thinking about anything," Martin explained on ↓360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was looking at a exchange.
Martin said to CNN, he asked Daley if his boss then knew the potential exchange.
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the President of the possible change was "conscious", the former staff officer admitted that it was possible that Obama knew about it.
Martin refuses to say that "Double Down" does not give a definitive answer to the question whether Obama's political sentences would have reached the board.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thinks Obama was not aware of the investigations whether to let offers fall at the elections.
"Cause," answered Martin.
What do you do with my e-mail?
Email named "Yes" email.
Was the design of the Internet service e-mail similar to the original mail technically implemented the letter secret?
In the conception of the former Internet services, it was in the foreground to make communication possible.
Therefore, in the basic technical protocols, it was not considered to create a stable foundation for an audience-safe letter change.
Therefore, a common email is more than a open mail card than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two connected directly?
The e-mail program or the browser of• first step sends the mail to their service provider's mail.
For example, if she had a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail → sends the contents to the provider that Benni uses.
The mail can run through some other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to the provider.
Will natural emails be joined on their way via the network?
Most mails are read by software robots on the way.
The provider of the sender is usually checked whether the mail leads to a damage programme as an attachment.
On the recipient systems, a virus check will also be carried out.
○ check the providers whether it is a fatal and unrequired spam mail that is deleted or at least sorted in a spam folder.
Do the robots have another job?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also provides information that Google needs to place context operation.
If you communicate with Benni via GMail about their coming vacation travels, Google can enlarge appropriate links to vacation offers.
Do you read the emails to the unknown people?
The probability that unlected persons read a mail is extremely small.
Theoretically, but it is possible.
In firms often, companies have the possibility of e-mails.
Furthermore, criminal prosecutors and secret services have legal opportunities to catch or learn emails.
There are possible illegal exposure actions.
Is it possible to send emails against meditation?
An encryption by OpenPGP standard can be encrypted effectively against message reading.
With high technical approach, it is also possible to enhance the metadata of a mail communication so that it can not even be recognised without any other way who has communicated with him.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
In the mainly used private mailboxes, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinated role in an investigation of Convios Consulting from August 2013.
Since the shares of Yahoo mail were recently fallen, GMail from Google could clearly give up.
Mother in the forest washed and casted rents
When his beloved mother died, a man from Wolfsburg cut off a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest, and continued to cast their rents and careers.
In order to be able to further cast rents and charges, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after investigation of the police in the forest.
At the same time, he had discovered the death of the 89-year-olds, then he spent the money for more than half years.
Now, the 67-year-old has to be responsible for disappointment, as a speaker said on Friday.
Then the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time, the mother needed no longer needed medicines.
He told the renter that his mother was traveling to Spain.
Because this was strange, they continued to recognize.
It was found that the two had spent more than 15 years in a common apartment and he had recently bound them.
The 67-year-old has accepted the death of his mother.
A obduction stated that the police did not have a standpoint for a capital crime.
Do you like icecreme that lights in the darkness?
A British undertaking has developed the first lighting ice in the darkness – with the help of callen.
Charlie Francis made use of the fluorescent properties of the seasters and created a lighting leckery from it.
The idea came to him after he had been reading a research work on Callen and could convince Chinese societies to make the lighting protein artistically.
The ice creme reacts in the consumption of the tongue, which enlarge the pH value in the protein and exhaust the light.
Chris explains that the food reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights – as far as it is so lighter, it will be better.
Charlie, the founder of the I'm Delicious Iiscreme Form, says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and there are two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice creme reacts with the tongue in a neural pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value and iron grows.
We have tested it in the past months and it appears to be ideal to bring it to Halloween in the market because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the greatest ice creme I've ever made because the coal light is four times more thirsty than gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it's good for it.
Charlie's experimental company with a seat in Bristol is famous for its unusual smaking directions in which beer, kiss, kitchen meat and black gold belongs.
But his latest creation is to become ambitionary.
He says, "I want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is to and for itself impossible because of the light breaking that is called by the eiscree, which consists of ice creme; but I think we can find an opportunity to create it.
The ice creme uses the fluorescent properties of a coal that is produced artistically by Chinese producers
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball association after six days.
Now it comes for the team of Ingo Ehlers to Derby tomorrow against the TSV Daverden, who has made his first victory last week.
With this game the season starts again for us.
"I hope we finally have the head free," Ehlers' behavior is optimistic.
He finally has, with the exception of the permanent damaged Hendrik Blohme, his complete framework.
Also Daverden puts us on a time game.
Therefore, we must keep our error quota lower.
In the first place, however, it is important to increase the covering which has recently left all other than a safe impression.
The Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is more disappointed after the first seasonship against North Horn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But this is why we are not the favorite for a long time, because there can always work everything in Derby.
However, Panitz now wants to put in Morsum to start a series.
False will be Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-Young Joost Windßuß, which is active with double game right in the A-Jugend-Bound-Bremen, is his season debugging.
Who is not heavy in such a game must stay home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was small, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were able to eat sweetness, stay late and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not explained that I would not be ready to distribute my apartment from sweetness, and I would like to do it this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year and grant a total of $6.9 billion for sweetness, costs and decoration, as a result of the US individual trade union (NRF).
One thing I'm glad for every Halloween then again is the trend values.
The costs will cost approximately 1.2 billion of $6.9 billion, as the NRF.
In this year, increasing unbearing objects are the last cry.
Women must no longer be in sexy clothing, they can now be able to cover for the dinner, such as pizza, hamburger or carotes.
As regards men, I expect every number of zombies thanks The Walking Dead, and I guess the Daft-Punk-Welkermen will create it in the Instagram Feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costs are zombies, Batman, pirates and hexes.
I think it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and we were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, the Americans give 330 million of people this year for the costs of their home animals, as the NRF.
That's a lot of "Hot Dogs".
As regards sweetness, we're not simply.
Americans will be distributed to 1.9 billion this year, as the Nilsen Company.
These are approximately 270 million kilograms of chocolate, clusters, bones and rubbers.
So it is notices for the US Department of Trading 41 million people who move through the quarter with the language “Soulness or Saures”.
In fact, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we do nothing – we do nothing.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar sugar Candy Corn; however, 15 million kilograms of it will be recovered for Halloween, so the National Connection of Sweet Products.
These are about nine billion kidneys.
It's a shot that I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than to the householder in which it goes.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is otherwise in a real prison), "Ho-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually ≥00 of acknowledged spikehouse in the United States, which achieve 500 million freedom, so America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pick up in the woods and then put the friends on Facebook where you don't release them again, and then one of the types on which you are standing leaves a comment as “after face expression”.
But we're finally coming to the cowboys.
Charlie Brown made us trusted with the Great Cubis when we were children, and the shot of a cubislater is like the beauty of Christmasba – something we have made from small.
Fortunately, the "Baby in Kürbis" thrill began to be the first year, thanks to Pinterest, so most of us are wake up to cut down the cowbis and not to sit in it.
This year, the Americans are issued about 106 million€ for cubiss, as the US Census Office.
The cubislaters who are slowly ruined in the foreground garden are deceived from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of cubiss were decorated this year.
If you want correct points, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and cut down something cups out of their 921 kilo severe cubes.
Accommodation fire in Helbursts: Saving forces cold body
The firewall had to express at the latest Thursday in the helmars.
A triifamily house in the country circle of the court catches fire in the night for Friday.
The salvation forces bore a cold body out of the house.
Rescue forces found a cold body in a dreifamily house at a brand in the helmary.
Whether it's an inhabitant, it's not clear, as a police speaker said in Bayreuth.
At the latest Thursday, it was burned in the earthquake of the house.
When the firewall arrived, the flames had already hit out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room was completely exhausted.
The whole earthquake has been protected.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, and the police speaker continued.
The building is no longer resident.
The accurate cause for the fire was not clear.
The largest country church of Germany has started an open-off for the profession of the pastor.
The background is a possible lack of pairs: The Evangelical-lutherian Territory Church Hannover calculates that the number of them currently will be half of about 1.800 pastors and pastors after the present situation until 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers future perspectives, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the job and the daily expiry itself.
With Burfies, the country church first ordered a pastor at a full place to enjoy young people for theology study.
Currently, less young people are determined to study theology after the Abitur.
Burfia brings this back to the process of dischirling: "God's voice is mild, the world is sound."
In this context, the vocation of great freedom and employment will be emphasised.
I am the Lord of my appointment calendar and can put my focus on it where it is important for me.
Shepherds may be very close to people.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
It will certainly be paid more in the free economy, but the teachers would have a safe employer.
This comes to the young people today who are not only about Kare, but about a sensible work.
According to the country church, which includes three quarters of the Nidersachsen, currently run about 60 pastors in the rest.
At the same time, approximately 40 students of a theological study start their vikariat.
In thin areas such as harz, Emsland or Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy places.
Burfies, among other things, want to work for young people and to invite prominents who have studied theology.
The theology study offers a broad education.
You can even be a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
Inside, rental seats and six points, as well as a free space.
The options include strengthened brems, a service package with maintenance of Bowler-Works mechanisms and logistic support until the vehicle installation is between events.
Drew Bowler, business leader of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally curves coming to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced drivers, but people who are on the search for spending and aventure, as well as a way to world class events.
We are pleased to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we believe that the format makes new opportunities to experience the various Rally Disposition Lines in Britain and the Foreign and prepare new people for the Strapace and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge Wagen – that will be a funny mastership.
Moreover, in the Defender Challenge, there is a training and test day in February, as well as the option to share in deserts in North Africa and the Near East.
Firewall called to save a dog that sets 15 meters over the ground on a yearly rock preview in a stone break
Cockerspaniel's cockpit Ruby was missing after a smaller accident.
Three days later, she was discovered by a spacious walker in stone break in her wrong situation
Firewalls turned away from the rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death
The firewall was able to bring a dog in security, fixed on a 15 meters high width in a rock wall.
The nine months old cockerspaniel heat Ruby was missing after a disaster accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a stone break on midweek.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, whose dog belonged to, came to the Steinbruch Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to get Ruby back in receipt and thank you to the firewalls of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were deceived to search for their missing honey and publish help calls in social networks when they fled in the stone break after the small accident.
About 14:15 in the middle of the week, a spacious walker, who carried out his dog, was a 15-metric rounded Ruby in the stone break.
The technical backing team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station turned to the place and moved to the salvation of Rubys, which was then transported in a dog box upward.
Andy ́yton, specialist of the technical backing team, said: “It was in an annual situation.
She was in the middle of the rockwand – 15 meters away from the top and the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her salvation – she was like a steel frozen.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate a few dogs.
That was a very unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist of the technical backing team, said: "Ruby had a riesen happiness."
It was the possibility that she was very seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was brought to the animal to the investigation, but he did not find anything except creation and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was terrible to see the salvation."
I couldn't believe she was really there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the poor.
The animal explained that if the creation had become too large and had been broken together, it would probably be disturbed.
The fireholders have done great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so thankful and everyone of them was absolutely unbelievable.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We had the chance that she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firewaters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains that he never appreciated Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio sender this week the Pop-Star said that she had joined as a background singer at Jaggers' song “Old Habits The Hard” from 2004.
Perry explained that she ate with the Altroker tonight, and that “he bound me when I was 18. ”
She added: "It's been a long time ago and he was very beautiful to me."
In a cloud, a representative of Jaggers, 70, on Thursday, said that he “declined categoryly that he had ever taken neighborhoods at Katy Perry”.
The representative added: "It may have changed him with someone else."
Perry was one of the songs who had an invitation at the Rolling-Stones tour this year.

George Kerevan: European distress gives the shots the choice
A new day, a new horrible story of independence.
This time we will be warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen space as a condition for the EU Membership.
This provides the steak for stories about pass controls in Berwick and a safe border with stacheld rates next to the hadrianswalk.
In fact, the Strathclyde model pointed out the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this, expectedly, did not play any role in the shiplines.
In addition, no one has noticed that the EU Member States often have decreased their strike rules if it is more favorable for them.
Since Scotland does not currently belong to the Schengen room, the continued non-respect for Brussels would only be a small consent in contrast to what you really want from the shots.
So there's no story.
And one that has already come so in the years that she is already like a fossil: I have heard the "indipendence means pass control" entity at least 40 years ago.
A interesting point is lost in constant repetition of this ural story.
Why should it be expected from an independent Scotland to tane after the fifish?
Why's the London Joch changed against that of Brussel, especially now?
These are the real news: the greatest, after the war, plan to join Europe has been stumbled.
The project of Europe has been dead with the Eurocrisis.
Parties won in the EU at the grounds that are enemies of the EU or want to throw the euro as a Community currency on board.
Even in Germany, the Euroscape Partie could create alternatives for Germany – first this year – at the same time, nearly five million votes at the federal day election in September, and so effectively remove the free democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Federal Day.
There was always a domestic opposition against the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis appears as a turnpoint.
As a result of the strict spar policy involved by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forces in which the national economy needs to be maintained by the common election, many people have believed that the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do to cause the national governments exhaustive budgets – that was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has established its members at exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and they want to make it so.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe is rebuilt with an integrated product report to Germany.
The only way is to reduce payments and public debts – urged by Berlin.
There is a deepest product-coming product problem behind the current food and wheat problems.
As a result of the “green” energy guidelines prescribed by Brusel – a code for the subvention of French and German energy undertakings on consumer costs – the industry pays compared to the United States the double for electricity and the fourfold for gas.
This is a loud cost of the way we could see in Grangemouth.
All the salaries in the world are not the petrochemical industry to be forced to the corner by billiged electrical gas.
As a result, a revolution, particularly in France, is the EU's unique Cheerleader.
After the war, the Political Elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany was able to keep in shack and Paris was able to take along with Washington.
However, Berlin has no longer been a port of political legitimation and Europe has opened its own economy policy, which has been combated by the proposed French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pens, EU enemy Front National, has just won a decision-making decision and thus refers to the governmental socialists to three places.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 pro­ votes – a timely warning for the British Laboratory party that it can't go out, a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly obtained popularity among the white French of the worker class?
She wants to use the EU walls next year to prevent an anti-EU, anti-Community road block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU partys are well cut off in these elections – and this is very well possible – then a such block could first dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want out: In not all the future, the growing resentiment against the EU and the common wage will be meet to decrease the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the "Europe of the (sovereign) N" which is favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may keep the euro firm, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I hope that UK is removed from this project in the hope of joining the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific area is near that the United Kingdom will stand only in the Atlantic rain.
Where's Scotland staying at all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – whether or not to tell Berlin and Bruseles what they can stop.
I think Scotland could be able to run in a more lockered covenant if we keep our own choices.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in an unfedered Europe of N.
Otherwise, we should assume that Norway is equal and keeps our economic independence.
The SNP Government in Scotland is – noteworthy – the most political movement against the Spar policy in Europe and has a special majority in 2011 due to the delay of the proposed (and taken) shortages that the Labor Financial Minister Alistair Darling and the following Tory Lib Dem coalition had to be responsible for.
It would be laughing for Scotland to decide to be independent now only to obtain a spouse policy from Berlin and Brusel.
Earlier puberty: Quickly wake up
Afro-American and Spanish girls trendly show the puberty rather than their white age sex, as shows research.
Corporal changes do not mean the puberty network yet
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic fatty is an exhibitor of the early puberty network
The trend to the early puberty is less exposed to boys
The former CNN Correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who has specialised on child health and family themes.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows seven or eight years old breasts and shame?
At the annual Conference of the Children Medical Federation American A日my of Pediat this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric Endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normally underlying girls and represented a new standard.
"I'm spending a lot of time to relax parents – usually it is not a sign that the puberty is now quick," said Caplowitz.
Obvious displays of development, such as growing breasts, shame and axe hairs, as well as bodies are shown earlier.
However, there was only a easy movement in the age of the menarch (recurrence of the first regulatory blood) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age of 12.5 years is less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years until menarch," said Caplowitz, also the author of the book "Free Pubertetes in girls: The essential adviser to handle this frequent problem."
The time is the most precise test as the puberty goes forward.
It is contrary to what actually represents the beginning of the puberty network, but it applies to “free” if the breast size is accompanied by a growth-shirt before an age of eight years.
In most cases, the process is slow or stagnated – something that a child can monitor exactly.
In faster advances, tests may be shown by an endichronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods to delay a early menstruation and the delay of another consequence: the early age of the bones that can ultimately lead to growth infection and thus a small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for a medical or hormonal treatment are oriented on the age of the child, development speed, growth rates and emotional rate.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is aware of medicines, but he adds: “The underpressing of the pubert network can reduce behavior problems and feelings of girls, other than their elderly genocides.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they hold the hygiene side," Caplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had received her days.
Even if there were the first signs and we had spoken about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came terrified and excited from school to home because she was the first in her friendship.
There are many comprehensive theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there are no significant evidence that hormones in milk or other nutrients, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be reasonable.
Boys come to the puberty, like girls before.
Caplowitz is the view that the most convinced premium is the epidemic of fattyness.
He supported the implementation of a employment in 2001 on girls in the age of six to nine years, which makes a connection between body fat and the entry into the puberty network.
Other investigations undertaken this conclusion, but there were many other people who played a role.
In this country, Afro-American and Spanish girls trends the puberty rather than their white age sex.
There are different statements for this.
Globally, it seems to be an early puberty network of all possible things, economic conditions over climate to genes.
Another race: Although boys are the face and shambearing already before, the trend to a completely pre-camped puberty is not as exposed to girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underline the complexity of the subject.
The survival of Akne and Shammar is spread in babies and children.
"We must be careful about how we identifie the real beginning of the puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child's endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not delay to give advice about their child.
"It can mean that you need to conduct a talk before you expect," says Caplowitz.
If you stay quiet, the child normally reacts good.
The girls who soon explode need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it comes in before than thinking.
Jumbo manufacturers strive in view of large commands on the width of the seat
Among leading aeroplane producers, there was a delay on the width of seats in the tourist class in long-stream flights, which indicated the sound for a bitter coincidence in Dubai Airshow this month.
The fight is about the width of the seat, which passengers are offered in long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are attempting flight companies to most, but this identified room provides the key to the efficiency claims in the latest airbus SAS and Boeing Co. flights.
Airbus requested this week a seat standard of at least 46 cm (18 pounds) in the tourist class, but the US Erz Boeing says that the flight companies should decide.
The departure comes to a time when the aircraft builders are leaving it, to increase more versions of their two engines in length, and expect records in the event from 17 to 21 November.
As the back part of the aircraft is equipped, especially if there are nine or ≥ seats, it is determined for the given economic results that will provide the new "Mini-Jumbo" design.
Boeing claims that his modernised “777X” phase 406 persons in tourist class sitting, which are more than 17 pounds broad and allows so ≥ per series.
Airbus explains that the competitive version of A350 transporters 350 persons in 18 pounds broad seats in the tourist class, where there are nine per series.
Airlines often divide hibe over technical details through advertising in the pharmaceutical press.
Now Airbus calls before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders will probably run directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an indication that could be at the beginning of a new display war and showed the money provider a picture in which three persons sit together in an aurant, and so the title: "Will you accept it?"
"Boeing proposes long-stream flights in seats that are worse than regional turbo props," says Airbus Explorer Boss John Leahy.
In view of changed nutritional habits, people are deeper, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-line travel, and at the end of the century, the weight of the medium-American master was increased by age between 40 and 49, so the data of the US Ministry of Health.
The Thailand volume of the medium-American in the 21th century is 100.8 cm of US health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival was held to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body range of the freshly baptized "Jet Set".
Airbus has thus performed studies that demonstrated that a social duty (2.54 cm) per seat increased the sleep quality by 53 pro.
Boeing strikes the numbers of airbus to the seats and says that it is not in terms of manufacturers to decide how flight companies made the balance between flight tariffs and institutions.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
"It is also true to give flight companies flexibility so that they can do what they have to think to be," states the Flight Cabin Expert Kentsver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate them what it makes profitable.
You know her business better than anyone else.
For flighters it is more flexible freedom, but for manufacturers it will be a topic that can affect the range.
Return to aircraft orders with a estimated volume of at least 700 billion dollars at list prices in the next year, which could be sustainable to the export by the United States or Europe.
As Re's first reported in July, the Sitzlayout is the driven force behind the decomposition of the new jets.
So wohl Airbus and Boeing claimed more than 20% Effect per sitting at their latest two-motor long-line designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeings statements on the results are partly depending on that the 777X will be compared with its seats per series with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The expenses per unit are still less than machines currently used with seats per row.
"Boeing quits, therefore, more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, leader for passenger comfort in the airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with seats per row in existing 777s indicated that many passengers decided to make the more strict arrangement, which could come in with billiger flight tariffs.
“Atttention too width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from a economic point the airbus offer was charged by the 777 threats,” says Mary Kirby, expert for cabinet facilities, founder and publisher of the Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats but a catalog of suppliers from which the flight companies can choose.
The well-traveling Jet sellers have even a band measure to meet the establishment at the competition.
Even if they appreciate the comfort, however, all producers also offer Jets with high-depreciated facilities for aircraft and regional flights.
Airbus offers a A350 with seat-seat lines, but it has not yet been rebuilt according to its own statement.
Airbus has recently highlighted the importance of more adaptability of the cabines and offered a wide seat for some Jets.
Without the support of the only other producer of a large modern Jet, experts say that the call will be proudly published by a new branch standard, but could refuse from the whale of 777X sales.
New anti-nikotine vaccine may make the garus pleasure when smoking
Objectives have developed an anti-Nikotin vaccine that could destroy the fun of smoking.
One single dose of the vaccine could mouse a life before nicotine.
Before tests on humans, further trials are needed, which can last a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cor _BAR_ Medical College in New York said that the first results were good.
"We are very hoped that this type of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers once who have tried to stop and test all the methods available on the market, but they have had to experience that their nicotine is stronger than these approaches," says Cor.
The new vaccine contains an unusual virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information on the production of Nikotin anticorps.
The virus selectively inhibits the liver cells that then produce a constant power of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they get the brain, and a smoker does not find nicotin height.
In trials, muscles who had been injected with Nikotin were injected in their normal A.
Mouse without vaccination, however, would have taken a "awake", explained the researchers, a sign that Nikotin had reached her brain.
The experiments are written in Fachblatt Science Translation Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the anti-corps speech that they were deep and unpraktic.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are probably clearly lower because it converts hepatic cells into antibodies.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans could, if he is absolutely sure, be given children before they are trying to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine.
But it is probably more likely that smokers would use him to stop.
“They know that when they start smoking again, they feel no pleasure for the nickotinim product, and that helps them to delay the habit,” he states.
British communities said that the results were interesting, but they warned at the same time that there was more research needed.
Tripodi stripped to be influenced by Obeid
To the former Minister of Labor party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, an investigation is initiated by the state of corruption.
The former NSW Minister is concerned that the rules for maritime fear have changed on request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who has the covered contributions to three baselines in a Stately controlled country.
The Indian Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigations on Friday on whether Obeid has influenced various State ministers to extend the contracts on Circular Quay, where the Obeids committed two restaurants and a café without a claim after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is found on account of the accusation that Tripodi knew the covered interest of Obeids in the foundations, after Tripodi had said in accordance with the previous representative staff officer Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
In years of negotiations started in 2005, the Government had committed public applications for the contracts.
The pairs were opposed and also wanted longer running.
2009, the contracts on the Circular Quay firms, which introduced the Obeids for 2.5 million per year, were extended without public advice.
Tripodi, who was a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally pronounced for public applications.
However, he refuses to have made the amendments on requests of Obeid, who, as Tripodi approved, had forced to transform the rules of the Government.
One of the ICAC phone records showed discussions from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading officer who was changed to the port minister after he had been held under Obeid in the fishing staff.
"Is this theme discussed in these telephone talks the development of commercial reproof schemes?", asked the Commissioner's representative Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," you answer Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli campaigns take targets, such as or sources
Israeli jail flights would have attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia, and a leading government worker against Fox News.
The officer did not state what was the goal, but said that it was at least one.
According to the Press, it was the objective of Russian SA-125 rackets.
At least twice this year, Israel has already conducted aircrafts on raketing deliveries.
Foreign workers with 457-visa could be subjected to "reality test"
The Government considers, within the framework of extended measures, a "reality test" for foreign workers with 457 visions.
If the test should be introduced, it shall take over a criteria for use that prevents the use of the 457 in order to occupy unqualified workplaces or as a back door for the movement of family and friends.
Today, a proposal was published by the Government after the former Labor party lawyers, Maxine McKew, had condemned the Government's comments on foreign employees because they could be taken as a facilitation by the neighbors.
“Sound statements such as “Externals to stand behind” and “Australians first” are a very uncomfortable removal in times when the company requested a successful work," she said to the India Institute today.
Historyly considered it said that white workers should be harmed – and if some in the region understand an echo of this historical artact, I would not wonder it.
The proposal for discussion is to include twelve measures adopted once by the former immigrant minister Chris Bowen.
Minister for Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was talking about human shoes in Sri Lanka yesterday, has implemented five of the recommended amendments that others will still be raised.
If the ‘reality criterium’ is adopted, a person requesting a visa may be checked in the case of ‘the application is true in the cases where the applicant relates to the holder or a relevant person of the undertaking’.
Firms could also be able to delay accounting for the number of 457 visibility holders after set up hundreds of companies who wanted to be subjected to a small number of employees in the past.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old sri-lankian asylant died in a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The disappointed nine-year-old son of the man, who came to him, has been deceived since his father's death at the middle of the middle of a wakeed cousin who was also on the ship.
The authorities held the man in the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The British Government has been announced to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to perform high speed connections between Scotland and North England at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Mr Baroness Kramer said that the project "will be closer to the United Kingdom".
The Scottish Minister Keith Brown explained that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed bathroom connection between London and West Midlands.
After phase 2 ends, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government corrected the estimated costs for the building of the high speed roads between London and North England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British Government, speaking with the transport of Scotland, has ordered HS2 Ltd to search for further travel capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
This is the possibility of a travel time last three hours or less of Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our objective for HS2 is a real national drawing network, which brings Britain and its cities closer."
We're going forward with HS2 because it brings great benefits to itself.
Without it, we stand before a capacity crisis in our train network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities,• Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved by HS2.
The Scotch State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "The present announcement is a message for Scotland."
In the name of the Scotch Government, Keith Brown Carmichael urged to use "unmisunderstood" for the Scotch integration in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed bathroom connection provides the potential of great economic advantages for Scotland, but at the same time, the economic force of Scotland provides an argument for fast road connections in the whole of the United Kingdom."
Therefore, we are pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed bathroom connection in Scotland, creating the benefits for all and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection, which the Scotch government has already planted.
I am pleased to examine the investigation report with the British Ministers next year and to decide together the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force temporarily
Flight passengers must also continue to disable tablets and arcs at starting and landing, despite efforts in the United States to lock the rules for such devices.
The United States Federal Aviation Aviation (FAA) allows US aircraft companies to change their standards so that passengers on their devices can read E-books during critical flight phases, see or play videos if they are in "flight mode".
The majority of the flight is allowed by passengers, but many people feel terrible that they cannot read their e-books when they start and land.
However, companies observe the decision to which the United States aircraft companies need to carry out unemployed work, but do not follow direct plans to amend their rules.
CASA also explained that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases were applied.
“The CASA has currently no specific rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft” has been observed.
The subject is subject to provisions whereby aircraft companies should maintain safety at any time and passengers should follow the security instructions provided by the cabin staff.
Virgin has already made flights with the CASA discussion on an extension of the use of its Wi-Fi maintenance system and explains that it is open for changes, but that must be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices through CASA because we are convinced that this would improve the customer's life after we now offer (free interview) during the flight," said a speaker.
Qantas explained that the current rules will remain until more.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices cannot be used at the start and landing, and we do not have plans to change it currently," said the company.
The FAA rules shall apply to US aircraft companies.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly consider the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision is different in the US companies after the age of the float.
You must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the radio operations through mobile devices, and change manuals, educational materials, manual package programs and customer training.
“A flight company has endorsed the tolerance of its float, it can allow passengers to use tragic, e-book reading devices, e-book reading devices and arphones at every height”, said the FAA.
In rare cases in bad view, the crew will show the passengers while landing disable the devices.
The group also recommended to make more difficult devices in the start and landing safely under the seat or in the stairs over the seats.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, the competitive BVB attachments were provided with light rackets for horse scenes in Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced hard consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Football Bundeslig against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a weight - tone.
It was an unhabited, almost sponsic acustic, who was bound to the viewer until shortly before the attachment of the Federal Game between the German Vizemeist Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Iduna Park signal.
To hear, the guests were mostly with their hands.
In contrast, the South Tribs, where the most faithful - and soundest - BVB-Fancs are, represented extraordinaryly mild: no footnote, no shot calls.
The potter of the Capo, which coordinates the common inflammation, remained unemployed.
And in front of the tribune, it was alone a large fashion with the title "Section Stadium Prohibition".
Only as the tourist Roman Weedenfield as always as the first BVB player, a short-term jubel burned.
When his colleagues followed, there were sounds and wounds - but no longer everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune, nothing happened.
Also that Stadium speaker Norbert Dickel re-numbered the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, winning over arsenal, prolonging the contract of Tra Jürgen Klopp - did not provide a feast.
Only five minutes before the cup, the Capo revealed his potter - and the gripable effort until hands is disturbed in a sound cry, as Dickel was used to break the vote on the rings of the stadium.
At the last time, the south tribe was like always at the row - and finally it was here again as the soundest place was used in the stadium.
And latest than with an appiff from the South Tribune the sound call "Therbysieger stands up" came, it was all again as always.
It was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04, some of the co-ordinate BVB Lightrounds in the spectacles and on the place were met - and nearly the Roman Weeden Fields.
The game was lately cut off because of the chaotic scene.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras in the office - and if you believe Watzkes words, this was an easily unfair date for the fans.
"The Ultra movement will give massive incidences," the BVB Boss announced on Thursday on a Podium Discussion in Frankfurt.
As a immediate measurement, Watzke underscored Ultras a chorography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I've prohibited it," he said.
The Null Tolerance Policy in Pyrotechnic things can't be abandoned.
Furthermore, the Ultra has been shown different opportunities to punish - until Tuesday, these have now been time to decide for a decision.
Otherwise, as Watzke, the BVB will establish a sanction until the end of the next week.
"It's gonna be cutting," assured Watzke .
You may be stressed how the reactions on the south tribe then occur.
Pfandhouse trees in Singapore, since the crisis has arrived in the middle story
Janani Amirthalinga, in a pandhouse in the purchasing seas in Singapore, switched a golden armshot, a ring and a couple earrings to pay their daughters' taxes.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, there my whole money is inside," Amirthalinga says.
Although she deserves 3.000 Singapore dollars (ca. 1.730 euros) each month as administrative employee, and her husband also works, the monthly family income does not describe it.
In fact, the question in parts of Southeast Asia, where the debt is increased, is so big that ValueMax, where she has changed, has become the Pfandhaus that is listed at the Singapore Board.
It is not just a faster way to get money – 1.300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as beneficial as an unsecure bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhouse in Singapore requires a 17 Pro's effective year-life, which is only more than 15,4 Pro, which the United Overseas Bank requires, a local credit provider with a share in the same purchasing room.
However, the households offer the advantage that there is no revision of credit value or income evidence here, so loans are sooner than in banks.
That is why millions of people in the region turn to houses of fandhouse, after the pressure of families through increased livelihood costs and a continuing budget and consumer debt.
After five years, a strong growth since the global financial crisis and credit credits due to a locker financial policy in developed economic areas seeks familys with smaller and average income income in order to compensate the subsequence in a stronger economy.
This week, the Rating Agency covered Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly by increased hypothecs, as a risk factor for the credit value of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, after the assessment of the Agency, have the maximum budget debt in Asia in relation to Brutto-Inland product.
Malaysia is located at the top of the list with 80 Pro­PIP, an increase of 60 Pro_BAR_ too in 2008.
People are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has just come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed an existing export weight and a delay of consumer request.
"In the end effect, it means that, in view of increased costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to add their income wherever it is possible," says the Song Seng Won, the economy of CIMB, a Malaysia bank.
History highests in the gold prices in the last two years have still strengthened the tend to deal with personal objects, since people use the opportunity to convert family's beauty into bargain.
In Singapore there are about 70 Pro of the conceived objects in the 200 pillars of the city of Gold.
The people say: "The gold price looks good, let's get our grandmother's gold chain and take back the next month."
The largest Thai Pfandh operator, EasyMoney, has taken a 20-proprocent customer growth in his fields in the past months.
The growth in the pandwork is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the stakeholders in the Sea and 15 more in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the neighboring Malaysia – where the company has four houses – but also outside Asia, so Ja Lee Ching, business leader of ValueMax.
The company finances the $60 Pro of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which took this week with the rental to Singapore.
When some credit providers have been added to the cross-feed because of high interest rates, yeah says that pandhouses don't only pay more rate than other suppliers, but also not directly increase the debt.
The Commission states: "Thes are eligible for items which they already have, and the distortion of personal values does not increase the balance of the budget," she states.
The financing of the board will continue to be accepted socially as a short-term, safe financing.
In addition, not all people who use the penalties are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come into ValueMax's sales to defeat gold bars and Rolex hours, for which they get up to 60% of the purchase price in bar.
We've got customers from every social shit.
“They belong to well-being who have a short-term business or investment, or small companies who have to overburn the cash flows,” says Yes.
Sometimes they just need very quick money.
NSA backs data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The Enth Service Enth of Edward Snowden has a principle of interest in helping Germany in the advertising of the constant NSA sprays.
After the presentation of the Green-Bunday Deputy Hans-Christian Strobele, there were surprising meetings with Snowden in Russia about the conditions in which the former secret workers would say at a German State official or before an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Snowden said to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Saving package over 325 million Australian for Tasmanian health
The Australian Government consists of the hard conditions associated with the Saving Package over 325 million Australian for the Tazmanian health care in order to ensure that the State's government cannot discharge the money.
The Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that Commonwealth will be taken “withstanding measures” to deal with a crisis caused by an elderly population of the island, a quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a four-year period was prescribed after government consultations with the independent taxmanian deputy Andrew Wilkie.
"The Government has enhanced a packaging of emergency, which is regarding our view of the unique challenges that the State is confronted with," Plibersek stated today.
The 325 million dollar package includes 31 million _BAR_ Immediate election service assistance.
More 2600 operations, orthopedic attacks and treatments for green stars are to be removed.
Moreover, there are money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceton, better care for stationary stays, training of fachars, psychical health services and the introduction of a system for electronic registration of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas of which clinical employees have told me that they are the best way to improve the taxman health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Ministry was on a strict reporting and accounting obligation of the Tasman Government.
The Federal State must maintain the current level of financing to get money from the Commonwealth and report monthly where the additional money was issued.
A three-commercial Commission will be established and will ensure that the Federal State provides health services as effective and efficient as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million would only use a little if “they were not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public taxman health system to a more sustainable course”.
Without prejudice, he praised the Government that she had responded to his request for a triggering assistance that he first had expressed against the Prime Minister on the beginning of May.
"I am convinced that federal aids will contribute greatly to the public health system of the Federal State from the list of concerns," Wilkie said.
According to the Government of the Federal State, these elections will enlarge the recent incidences.
However, the health policy speaker of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is the view that today’s announcement is only a “plaster solution”.
"We are therefore in the situation today because the Labor State Government has removed 430 million from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It cannot be that a government is nearly a half billion travelling from the system and the Commonwealth 300 million and then doing it as if it was the news.
Dutton requested Plibersek to ensure that none of the salvation package will be issued for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of the Romans of Denis Diderot convinced by extraordinary production equipment and timely details, however, is more difficult than necessary.

Severe opportunity to produce chemical weapons, such as a monitoring group
It has decreased important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gas munitions, explained by the global chemical weapons monitoring group on Thursday, while in the north of the country there were serious coincidences near one of the sites where toughly toxic substances are stored.
Similarly, on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war soon as three years ago.
The announcement of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) came on a day before the date
1 November, which has placed an organization in the Haag to make all the facilities for the production of chemical weapons or "inoperable", all machines for the mixing of chemicals to gas and the filling of munition.
The conclusion of this process, which is in fact the first step of the Zersupplement, is an important milen steel of a ambitioned schedule aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons until mid 2014.
The extent of the institutions means that no new chemical weapons can be produced.
However, it must be to begin with destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
Accordingly, there are approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including Senfgas and Nervengas Sarin.
The announcement came to a time when fights found in Safira on Thursday, by the experts said that there was a chemical weapons production installation and storage places, such as the United Kingdom's seats of human rights observation.
The activist group, who follows the number of dead through a network of activists, explained that 120.296 people were dead on Thursday.
It was 61.067 civilians, 6.365 children.
On the sides of the Government, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 were government friends and 187 libanese hisbollah milisions.
Similarly, among the dead are 2.202 deserted army soldiers and 5.375 fighters of opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 1000,000.
This number has not been updated until now.
The conflict has forced approximately two million people to flee from the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, from which many connections with al-Qaida groups.
The observatory office said it had lost on Thursday on both sides, but it did not call details.
The fights support the exhibition of the chemical weapons inspectors because their mission to freedom from gifty weapons is a run against the time in the midst of a higher citizen war.
According to the OPCW, which is closely associated with the United States, the team is “now convinced that it has seen all important production and mixing/making devices mentioned by Others and has the middle of their depths.”
That is why “no other inspections have been planned since now”.
In the beginning of the week, the inspectors explained that they had completed the first part of the reviews and visited 21 of 23 of the sites indicated by Cusco.
As a result of security thoughts, the inspectors said that the two institutions were not possible.
On Thursday, the OPWC, which were two places as a Syrian statement, declared “and which existing objects of the chemical weapons programme were reduced to other installations referred to as inspected”.
It was not clear that the stages in Safira were one of the two installations that could not be visited by OPCW inspectors.
There has been a plan for the completion of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I draw the hair before the tapberity and the courage you all showed in the fulfillment of the most urgent mission that has been carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Organization of Monitoring in a comment published by the OPCW.
Since three years, the primary Sunnith Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against the government of Assad and their security forces, which are many members of the Alavites, a catalogue of the Shitish Islam.
With regard to further developments, the leader of the Observatory Group, Rami Abdurrahman, has given a strong explosion in a air defence facility in the Syrian coast province Latakia in the midweek.
The cause of the explosion is not a matter, he explained.
Anger on the judgment of bombs of Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had come to life during the bombing in Bali in 2002 reacted increasingly on the sentence for the last of the employees sent before the court, since Omar Patek should be killed permanently.
Patek, who was almost years as one of the most visited people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to a 20-year arrest penalty for his role last night in building the boom bodies.
It could be released by a restitution after 15 years.
The 45-year-old of the mass murder was found guilty because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist quarter of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 more, and many others were hurt.
A debt was also held in a series of terrorism accusations, which included a wall of sprinkle attacks on churches in Indonesia at the week 2000.
The State Advocate had requested a life-life prison penalty, even if it had been for the man who was called as a master bomb builder as a "demolition Man" who could have been able to execute death.
The decision has made painful reminders in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who has lost her 39 years of age, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction of Patek and his companions almost a year ago.
She said that Patek should have been condemned to death.
I really mean he should follow the footsteps of the other guys.
"Man should put it before a shooting command," Corteen said to AAP.
I need to live every day with no other uncle and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was similar to the earth, when on 12 October 2002 shortly after 23 hours, a big bomb exploded in a small layer that was parked before the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Pa日's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a self-smorder exploded a ruck sack with spending.
After the attack, he fell into coma for a month and “dead” three times, while he got on a life-keeping system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same shick salle as the three other members of the terrorist Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Prim Samudra – who were responsible for the blood bath and were arranged four years ago.
Actually, this type should have the death penalty before all others.
Let him live – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and killed many hundreds of people is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali-Bomber standing before the court.
He started almost a year of prize, but in January 2011, s\ s was attacked in the Pakistan City Abbottabad, where US trip forces killed the former al-Qaida-Chef Osama bin Laden.
Within the negotiation, a FBI agent said that secret services reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Laden with the goal of rebuilding the connection between South Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't sit," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has not shown repentance for how many suffering he has granted to others.
The sentence occurred before the annual anniversary of the attack in this year, which will be conducted with memory feasts in Bali and Bali.
"There will be many trees this year," Corteen said.
Patek may still call against his judgment.
FAA: Flights can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but no telephone talks)
Flighters can now hear their electronic devices for reading, work, games, music and use the view of films, but not phone with the phone, so the new directives issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Aviation (FAA) to the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented, depending on the relevant flight company, FAA collaborator Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Flight companies must demonstrate the FAA that flights are in accordance with the new Directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight staff, as well as the arrangements for the deployment of devices in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA explained that it had already received plans from certain flight companies that wanted to build the use of tragic electronic devices in flights.
These flight companies also were Delta and JetBlue.
"We could, according to the state of the plan, approve the extensive use of electronic devices very quickly," said the FAA in a confidentiality.
Currently, passenger artphones, tablets and other devices must disable when the airports are closed.
You can only start it again when the flight has reached a height of three kilometers and gives the Captain green light.
When incoming to the country's aircraft, the flightests must disable them again and cannot start them again before the flight is landed.
In accordance with the new directives, aircraft companies whose aircrafts were safe against electronic screening could allow their passengers to use the devices also at the start, landing and on the roll field.
The most new aircrafts and other F.I.F.R., which were surrounded in larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Flight Group, welcomed the amendments.
“If the new scheme is secure – and we are working closely with the flight company – both sides will benefit from it,” commented Glading.
We are honestly deceived to feel as supervisors on this subject.
However, Internet connections remained prohibited to surface, exchange of emails, text messages or downloads of data under three miles, the Authority stated.
passengers are invited to move arcphones, tablets and other devices into the flight mode.
So still no “Words With Friends”, the Scrabble similar online game that the looking player Alec Baldwin 2011 played on the artphone when he had to leave an American Airlines Jet actively because he refused to disable the device while the aircraft was parked on the flight.
And more heavy devices such as laptops have to continue to be represented, since there is a disorder drive here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile talks remain also prohibited during the flight.
The regulatory competence for telephone talks is not at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.
FAA may have a prohibition for certain electronic devices at starting and landing on
Last month, Mark Rosenker said of the National Transport Safety Board, the CBS News security experts, phones would still be considered as a risk.
"Handy is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential screening on devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from air can also shalt the shield masters," so Rosenker.
A consultation committee of the branch, called by the FAA to investigate this subject last month, recommended that the Government enable a wide range of personal electronic devices.
In the past years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to locate restrictions for use.
Critics such as the Democratic Senator McCaskill from Missouri represent the view that there are no valid security foundations for the prohibition.
The restrictions are also far more difficult to be implemented because the use of devices has become global.
In some areas, the talk that forgets or ignores until a third of the passengers disable the device.
The FAA started in 1966 to insult the use of electronic devices by flying, after reports on screening of facilities and communications devices by passengers UKW-Radios, which represented the latest technology trend.
New aircrafts are far more dependent on electrical systems than former generators of aircraft, but they are also built and authorised by the FAA that electronic interferences do not make them anything.
Airlines have offered passengers since some years Wi-Fi when the flights are reached.
The facilities adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more inevitable to interferences.
The major majority of passenger aircrafts should be appropriate for the increased use of electronic devices in accordance with the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally give less radio radiation than former generators.
E-reader, for example, gives the minimum radiation only when you broadcast.
However, when downloading or sending data, transfer values are stronger.
To defeat a lockering of restrictions for the use of devices by passengers, Amazon.com is counted.
2011 Company workers invited a passenger aircraft full of childle E-reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but they could not find.
Members of the FAA Surveillance Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding the risk of the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd from the passenger band National Propertyation of Airline passengers said he was the view that the sight by the devices is true, even if the risk is minimum.
Other committee members said there are only single reports of pilots talking about aircraft systems through the devices and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to organise the devices by passengers under bad view conditions.
A grouping from the travel industry welcomed the changes and encouraged them as a reasonable adjustment to travellers that would have been largely equipped with technology today.
"We are glad that the FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger life is not in resistance to security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travelling.
Refreshed birds rescued by air rescue service of Northern Sea Island
An air rescue service at the coast of the coasts of the birds found on a northern sea coast island was released again to the nature.
The water role was taken last month with a screw to Aberdeen, where it was repeated by the Scotch Animal Protection Organization SPCA in its salvation center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, leader of the Centre, said: “This water roll was probably a winter bird from North Europe, which was stopped by the strong wind over the North Sea.”
It seems that the shocked bird looked for refuge on the island of the bourgeois.
He added: "He couldn't leave anymore, why we were contacted with the request for help."
When she was released, the water roll was filled again and healthy.
Is Europe's elite ready to make business with Britain?
Business for Britain was started in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and definiting what those who are concerned about the welfare and work in Britain want to change our relationships with the EU.
For this purpose, we gave the largest and comprehensive investigation among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about British, Economy and the EU.
YouGov asked over 1,000 leaders from the economy which represented the British business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the investigation will be surprised by many.
We have discovered that the major major majority of companies exported outside Europe and could be able to join countries, modernising and growing, while the countries in the EU stagnate.
They want new trade connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil to be favoured by the Government side is to stop the long and urgent process to reform the obscure EU institutions.
In question of certain legally regulated topics – from the map law to the product legislation – most economic leaders believe that the control of these key skills should be restored to Westminster.
It was general insatisfactory about the fact that, according to the statement of the companies, the costs of the Bruseles rules would oversee the benefits of being part of Europe's trade zone – even 40 per cent of the major companies agreed to the traditional of the European most friendly.
S · and mostly, the question of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of the United Kingdom wants a course to change the agreement and does not draw up a relationship with the EU based on trade.
This knowledge, which is found in all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy requires a "sensitive change" that brings the debt of the action back to British.
It is a lot – a change in the Agreement and better conditions for the Great Britain would lead to a change in view of the residence in the EU in a national vote.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this investigation shows that the British Economy is a plan for the new negotiations of the British Conditions for the EU Membership.
It also shows that enterprises expect a clear movement of power conditions to the United Kingdom from a new negotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible, and it is necessary in the meantime after the euro zone is now moved towards a closer economic and fishing union.
The priority must be workplaces and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey shows what a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Bruselian approach to rules for companies.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom covered Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas
The beginning of the building of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the beginning of one of the largest energy projects, explained the Gazprom representative.
"The present event is a milenstein: the building work in the Bulgarian section of South Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and important project in Europe, has started," said the president of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, on Thursday in a statement.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire continent.
South Stream will provide for more information on Russian export routes through Europe.
A contract between Gazprom and his pens in Ukraine, where the majority of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, provides a higher risk for conventional routines, as is to hear officially.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, signed that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever" excluded.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to profitable tariffs when the whole project is in operation 2015.
According to Gazprom, building works in other countries followed on the planned road will be started to end the year.
The pipeline is exposed to an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubics of earth gas.

Review before the Queen Commission: Two YMCA employees in the case of accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual delegates
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual delegates in relation to children before 2011 prejudices against the child manager Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as was learned by the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children.
However, in the Commission's voting statement, YMCA stated that “never has been done in the organization with a case of sexual child abuse”.
Business leader Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee was accused of a child pornography crime and another person in which a sports teacher of YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 was condemned for misuse.
Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He emphasised that the YMCA's procurement statement towards the Commission was also unnecessary in the statement, “the YMCA's external examinations, in which YMCA was recognized as the first front of the child's security”.
In addition, evidence from the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that he received the secondary evaluation of four possibles in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministerium of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, agreed that the business leader had rejected “after me” in the position of Lord and did not ensure that the workers had been able to report infringements against children's security directives.
Lord was sentenced by the beginning of the year for sexual offences to twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was condemned at least six years of prison.
Hare, however, concluded that the YMCA had a cultural problem that the worker stopped to report Lord's crimes on the security of children.
The employees said that they had observed crimes, including that Lord was alone with children, she was private as babysitter, let her sit on a shot, said that he loved it, and allowed children to play with phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose representative Lord was and who had asked for a school for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the Child Service Leader Jacqui Barnat, who was the proposed Lord in YMCA Caringbah, “is very disappointable and most of the time was very inappropriate”.
The business manager explained that he would not accept the statements of employees that they would not have trusted in repaying their proposed report.
Instead, he said, rather, their friendship with the Lord has affected her judgment powers, so they would not have told him.
Hare explained that he informed the representative of the YMCA NSW that the lection that the organization had to take from the "Jonathan-Lord Intercast" was "not related to the report" by the employees, and the proposal agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to force the employees to sign secret obligations shortly after the accusation occurred was taken by the Child Officer of YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that it should be prevented from contaminating the evidence, but that has been “overlooked” and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, no safe organization for children, Professor Stephen Stephen told allbone by the Griffith®, expert for sexual child abuse, the Commission.
He stated that there were "fair problems" in the position, examination, training, training, and monitoring of the workers.
The hearing was taken until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but he assumes that a comback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight at the fifth year of his exemption from the office, 59 years of age announced its views on various internal issues.
Since in June 2007, after a year as a leader of State, Blair has avoided largely expressing himself to British, and his comments are mostly limited to the external policy and its role as an assistant of the quarter of the peacemakers in the Near East.
On the question whether he would return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair from the Evening Standard from London was quoted with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that it is, so ..."
When the horse-view experts found in a crowd in Cardiff to get the horse of the year, they knew that a hard competition battle had occurred.
But no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The knirps, who has not yet been in the child garden and has made his first steps just a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee travelled locker through the three winds and took the first price – and they left 30 waxed enemies behind.
The unseparable couple, both the same large, was lolosed because of their occurrence, behavior and style in the annual competition, which was organized by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he arrived in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he set his tears in a fresh angle and led the two-year toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural abilities in trafficking with the Pony, which was greater than age.
And Toffee received notes for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received toffee last March as a gift to birthday and exercised each day with the Shetland-Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and toffee are a great pressure."
They had to join the entire shareholder field and went out of the place with Goldpokal and Rosette.
It was just the second time he had shared with toffee in a competition, and we were all disappointed when he won.
Perfect foreigners in the Arena believed that he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the town of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows the footsteps of his tante Sharon Howells, who has led horses over ≥ ≥ 1 years.
Howells said, "The whole public was as electricized and all were thrown and thrown."
He walked on sand the whole length of the Arena and even though he looked so vicious, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy for animals – he lies horses, tractors and farmers and has two kitchens that he cares for.
As he has started, it will not take long until he is on the "Heaven of the Year" shadow – and I am sure he will be cut off well.
One speaker of the annual horse view said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how he should handle with Pony."
They're a great team together.
The jury evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how good they had been struck and presented in the leading.
They cared for cooperation between Pony and leaders – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fentton's sweet clothing has reached its part of it, which really fits perfectly for the opportunity.
Chinese magazine should be "reformed" after call
A Chinese magazine requested to be reformed on the title page for the release of a reporter who was accused of discrimination, explained a press regulator.
The new express in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later, in the television, admitted that he had adopted the payment money to false reports on a national company.
Now the New Express of a "complete rectification" will be subjected, explained by the regulatory staff.
The ‘Rectie Schedule’ was issued by the Press and Public Authority, Radio, Film and TV in Guangdong.
Periodic investigations showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inadequate reports on the zoomnotified company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editing management of the New Express was unordered," said the regulatory staff in a statement.
She said that it was decided to "contract a administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to remove his reporting licence to him".
“The Yangcheng Evening News Group has been recommended to be a complete rectification of the new express and recommended to identify the relevant responsibles in the new expression and immediately to check the leading team of the New Express.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported of common financial irregularities in a manufacturer of Baumachine named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the magazine published two calls for his release on the title page and set behind his journalist work.
But then, Chen arose in the state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as all the news industry and their ability to gain the trust of the public," he explained to the State messager CCTV.
I did it first because I was out of money and praise.
I realized that I did wrong.
In addition to Chen's excuse, the New Express published an excuse on the title page and explained that it was prohibited to check the reports correctly.
Miscellaneous disputes have been reported in the television in the latest time.
Experts say that events are still forced routinely, despite a change in law in the beginning of the year in which the authorities were prohibited to force someone to accuse themselves.
Detected tunnel with own railway between the United States and Mexico
One of the most raffined tunnels for the swimming between the United States and Mexico, which was completely equipped with lighting, explosion and electrical training, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeter tunnel measured as one of the most dispersed passengers they had ever found.
The Tunnel, which leaves in the Zigzack pattern over a length of nearly six football fields, connects storehalls near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are invisible storage Halls that make it easier to hide LKWs with loaded.
The tunnel was closed before it could be transported unrecognizedly, the authorities declared.
At the discovery of the tunnel, a half tonnes of Marihuana and 148 kg of cocain were ensured, so the records of the Court.
Three men who, according to the statement of the authorities as a leader, were accused of the possession and purposed sale of Marihuana and Kokain.
They threatened prison penalties between years and years of life.
In Nogales, Arına, push smugglers on an expanded underground network of dilution channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passport discovered since 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the Marihuana Ernte in Central Mexico, which provides the cards for the challenge of bringing their product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passport of approximately 640 meters long with shiets, which were sent by a kitchen in a living house in Tijuana to two store houses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still loves
Looking players Orlando Bloom and Museum Miranda Kerr want to go futurely driving ways.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of the two-year Flynn.
Orlando Bloom has expressed himself for the training of his wife, Topmodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with the US journalist Katie Couric, which should be spread on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "the life is sometimes not exactly as we plan or hope it."
Kerr and he still loved himself, stressed the 36-year-old.

Kerr and Bloom are married since 2010, their son Flynn was born in 2011.
The Veganism, according to Lexica, is subject to vegetarism, but it distinguishes in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of sahnetors, ice or a strong edamer, these wounds are not on the map of a veganer.
Milk, kiss, egg, besides the delay of meat and fish, the Veganer leaves from the consumption of all animal products - also honey is denied.
Whatever remains, you can ask yourself, but in closer consideration, the Western Engineering World is a significant incidence.
"Ute Henkelmann, the inhibitor of the hithern reform house, which provides a number of special products for Veganers.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the laden in the Domgasse.
Since 13 years, the newsleader countries Vegan, in Lampertheim he has found everything he had to live. "I killed my nutrition in 1997 and became vegetarian."
About the centuries, the next step took place and I became Veganer.
"The conviction came not only because of the nutrition, but because of the choice of shooting," says Proctor, the artist's head of normal leather.
He recognized that it was also in other daily interests without animal products.
In the first place, Vegan is a ethic.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the maximum of the Veganers, which are focused on all consumption behaviour.
Instead of refreshing citizens, roads, or gumibernators, the Veganer has quickly discovered a very new product that has increased enjoyment.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, Vegan's no delay, no askes, but it's a range deterioration." The assumption that you're reducing the selection of food options with the nutritional transformation, the Proctor's leading to the power of the habit.
And precisely these conditions also allowed some of the still so well-mentioned trials.
"The search factor is a completely decided decision that allows many to leave quickly, similar to smoking," says Proctor.
And he says, "Some smileys are not to be established in the animal."
Often, it is the garments or the type of preparation that make the pleasure.
"You can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the Veganer.
For example, Proctor brings to a grill fest, for example, aubergines, champignons and a few vegan worsts.
It takes attention to an exhaustive, distinguishing nutrition, which, of course, will be deeply soft.
Of course, you want something between the teeth, that's legitimate.
"It must be funny, but it is not only to reduce animal nakedness," so Proctor.
Health damage until eating, another broad adoption, he has not suffered.
For me, the transformation had a positive aspect.
I don't take a foreign cholesterin and have a higher vitamin share.
There are high-efficiency athletes that eat themselves outside vegan.
"My blood values are best, I often let me check," delivers Proctor.
In addition to the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus critics warn.
"When animals are feeded with feeds, instead of grassing on the wheat, it is wonderful whether in the meat that is buying in the coal, the vitamin-B12 part is high," finds Proctor.
For Veganers it is also possible to take the Coenzym in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he said.
The Proctor must not go for the proper food acquisition.
Basic feeds are available everywhere and every Super has a middle of sojamilch and other products.
Everything I need, I'll find out of the place.
I'm just buying something special.
"Multium people think that only the finished products are higher, but that is how it is too related to "usual" finished products."
Without preparation of Vegan courts is much more favorable and less timely than generally accepted.
"In the household, there is much to discover, with a few small knifes you can find if you don't have partly better results," says Proctor.
Margarine placed butter, a little more backpulver and coal acid place ie, with his vegan kitchen, Proctor also could make his swimming parents married.
Family festivals the Veganer provides a new wheel.
That's dynamic when you buy together, it's a new place value.
"The situations that can occur are as different as people themselves," Proctor says.
Of course, but he has already been encountered by Skepsis.
Didn't my eating be funny?
"Will I feel bad now because I'm milk three?" - in such questions, you must act as Veganer with fingerprint feeling.
"I don't refuse people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to expire.
And more accurately, the world seems not to be as desperate as it seems - and the Veganer is not as limited in all days as generally.
More fast food is allowed.
There's pommes everywhere!
"Multiple donations offer the balls, or just a vegetary yufka," says Proctor.
In a pi ́ria, he weighs on past courts, or just orders a pizza without cup, everything a question of the habit.
The restaurants are so slow.
"When I started to feed me Vegan 13 years ago, everything was much worse," the new countries could find a development: "You must talk to people to make them careful."
"If there are enough questions, they may be able to add the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, for example, the combustion in Mannheim or the café bird free.
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants also have at least a vegan court on the food map.
In fact, Weaven's judgments are taken for everyone there.
Everyone can eat it, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusively.
"The meat judges, however, are exclusive, and in the true sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor states.
"If you want to avoid food scandal, Veganism is a safe way to make the largest part of the preconditions impossible," says Proctor.
But the purchase of vegan products may be difficult at the beginning.
In particular, when you learn to understand that it can also contain animal additives as colors in the earth, it seems to be quick to leave the courage by following the ethics in so many hardships and falls.
Not only therefore, Ruben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Vegannum - animal contents and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are used to purify the property, but also cleaning.
"Near and after you develop a scanner view and know what characters and logos you have to take care of, "It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stay or to stoop," says Proctor.
The Veganism, he's a important moral fingerprint that turns on the consciousness.
Perhaps he can't completely take away his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to ask his habits critically.
Nasdaq OMX is keeping his customers in spirit.
The trade in Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator made technical problems responsible.

The British Police makes asange a delivery notice
Today the British police has delivered a consignment to the WikiLeaks Greener Julian Assange who searched for refuge in the Ecuadorian news in London and requested asyl.
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year-old appeal was made to the 40-year-old, which invited him to appear in a police guard, and to add, he should not follow him, threatened him to arrest.
Assange, the delivery to Sweden is threatened for the accusation of a sexual delicity after its opportunities have been issued under British law since the Court of Justice has rejected its commitment against the delivery of the beginning of the month.
Since he feared that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he looked for the ecuadorian news in London and asked the South America country for political asylum on 19 June.
Scotland Yard has “invited a 40-year-old man to put himself at a time we have chosen at a police guard,” said a speaker.
He continues to hurt the conditions of his release on the curse.
The message gave no comment on the submission of the police request.
Asange fears that Sweden has delivered him to the United States and accused him for possible spying projects after he had published more than 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks Enthing Website.
The driver who was born with 210 km/h and heavy drink between the feet receives 1.000 £ penalty
A car driver has been punished with a penalty of 1.000 £ because he was driven up to 210 km/h and a warm pig between his feet.

After the police had stopped him, they discovered the tree beach between his feet.
In front of the Court of Justice Colchester, Howie is guilty without the needed care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month road prohibition.
Howie was also condemned for the payment of costs of 90 £ and for a 100 £ offer.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculations blaze
The Ministry of Finance has temporarily calculated the CGT measure, but still expects the final decision of the financing officer George Osborne, who in the budget of 2012 had charged a rate of 7 % on apartments costing over two million pounds and annual taxes for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
The income from the stamp tax for property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which laid up in 2012/13 at 708 million pounds, together for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, northwest, northwest, Yorkshire and the region Humber.
Cook said: “After the increases in stamp tax on high-prise apartments and the introduction of legislation against a trafficking, it is difficult to claim that high-quality immobility is too low, despite the effects of the older Community tax system.”
“But this step could make some foreign investors retaining the purchase of immobility in London, or stop holding owners of it,” he added.
First-classic immobility – the top five to Property of the apartment at price – in the southern South-West coast of London, which stretched from Fulham to Wimbledon, have been estimated at 11.8% in the last year.
The prices in Central Londres shown a balanced annual growth of 5.6%, but they were overcome by an exciting “Inland” in which the southwest part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the East (6.5%) experienced a surrounding stream of Savills.
Objectives were able to put more lights on how the dog's swimming is with his vote.
Earlier research has shown that happy dogs with the swine spread more to the right (of the sight of the dog), while in nervous dogs was the left side.
But now the competitors say that other dogs can observe these subtiles and respond to it.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurological scientist of the University of Trient, said: "In humans it is good that the left and right brain helps are different to Stimuli, providing positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see this in other species.
He also noted that the right brain help was responsible for the movement of the left side and that the two hemisphers played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the sides of the blasts of their arts, researchers watched the animals while these films of other dogs were watched.
They measured the heart frequency of the fourth and analysed the behavior.
We'll probably understand why the swanz moves into the one, once in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dog films with dogs — either a naturally conscious version or a silhouette to eliminate other abnegative aspects, and so we could control the movement of the swine more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how another unexpected dog moved the swimming to the right (from the perspective of the distressing dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the blackness was preferred to the left (not from the perspective of the dog that divorced), their heart frequency increased and they looked inappropriate.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not communicate relatively with each other through these movements.
Moreover, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience in which movements they should be worried and won't.
He said: “If you have different meetings with other dogs and the widow with the sweet is rather linked to friendly behaviour and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, you are reacting on the basis of these experiences.”
The researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers can help to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert for dog behaviour and guest pension at the Faculty for Animal Health of the University of Bristol, explained that this was not the first part in which it was examined whether to be important for dogs at the left and right.
Last year a team of Lincoln's University found that dogs turn the head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and rightly when it is a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following states: “There are better going to a robot hole when it is "Schwanz" divorced on the left and not on the right to be insulted – just differently than in the Italian."
According to his statement, the subsections could therefore touch that the dogs in the different areas did not interpret animals in the movies or robot dogs as dogs.
He explained how dogs react to real dogs.
“Why are there significant claims for many different kidneys that both brain halfs are used for different purposes, but many of the details must still be determined – and dogs are no exception there," so Bradshaw.
Since their behaviour is simply going on, it will probably not take long until we understand why the swine is sometimes moved into one, sometimes in the other direction.

Papst Franziskus referred to in February, first Cardinale
Papst Frances will first be called new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican gave on Thursday.
Cardinales are the most incoming cleric in the Catholic Church after the papa, and they are also who choose a papa, so that French will call the first group of men who will finally be involved in the choice of his follower.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal that has reached a 80-year-old can no longer share in the paper station – that is a group of 120 "elected cardinals".
In a statement in which the message was given, Father Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said that there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremonie will be kept for the nomination of the new cardinals, which would also be a conscitoria.
"Papst Franziskus has decided to give his decision on the execution of the Consident in February in order to be planned to other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of electoral cardinals will probably be disappointed until February.
He explained that a dad is usually designed as many cardinals as needed so that the number of electioned cardinals would be 120 again, and so many cardinals more than 80 as he wants.
That is why the concision is important in the next year because it is the first thing since the election of France in March this year, as Valero.
Now there is a certain surplus of Europe, in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new father will call cardinals from the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty Pro of the Catholics live in South America, but they have only a winning number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first ones who have been invited since the Council of the Cardinals established by France to find a group of eight cardinals from the whole world who have the mandate to find opportunities to reform the church.
In the past, the dad's all disappeared alone.
"Now Frances has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He explained that it was “good possible” that Frances asked the cardinals for the Council.
But until now we were not in this position – that's all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would call to cardinals, but the French “full of surprises – so we don't know who he is mentioning”.
GM calls new Pickup tracks in the United States to repair the loans
General Motors call about 19.000 of his new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup trucks with Bühr 2014 to deal with a problem with the manually imaginable seat loans, such as a communication of the US regulatory staff for vehicle safety on Friday.
In some of the cars, there can be a defect in the mechanism to restore the premises.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Guidelines for the safety of vehicles in the head.
“When the vehicle is opened from behind, the head is possible that the insects are not correct, so there is a higher risk of damage” was read on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Safety (NHTSA).
The revocated models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM-track started in June and sets the main model start of the leading American car manufacturer since the restructuring of 2009.
GM informed the owner of the vehicle in the first half of October of the defect.
The NHTSA could not verify the notification writing because of the 16-day Government Shutdowns, which had negative effects on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra Track, newly developed for the 2014 model year, was taken at 20% in the first months of the year, GM stated on Friday.
In October GM 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup trucks.
The GM action increased by 1,4 Pro to 37,47 US dollars on Friday Evening.
A obama selector's depreciation cry
I have chosen President Obama twice in the hope that amendment might be possible
He says Obama has committed praiseworthy efforts that have been undertaken by the blockadetactics of the Republicans.
The blocking policy does not apologize to Obamacare's web site problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memories on the election battle 2008 were a grievous reminder of what was possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I read a terrible triumph book now.
It is a book I believed that it would open me during the second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (mout to win) and shields the Memories Barack Obamas to the presidency election 2008.
If I'm done tonight with my patients' discoveries and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when the millions inspired and one talk could get the breath.
The election was taken to a earthly Russian and news speakers to lead the historical importance of this hour before the eyes.
My classmates wept for joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready to change.
When Obama changed to office, Obama had 82% appropriation values.
And then I close the book.
Switching again to the present is a bad wake up as if you are scattered out of a dream.
It seems difficult to remember these optimist times – they seem to be a vague reminder, a grievous reminder of lost opportunities.
In the years since I gave my voice to the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and multilateral things that Obama has reached from the distortion of the Affordable Care Insurance Act to the military exit from Iraq, the end of the forced deviation of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the part-political blockedtactics have been covered too many efforts with which our nation should be predicted: immigration reform, a public option for hospital insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to be called only some.
However, after I have defended the government of Obama against colleagues and known ones, I am at the end with my declaration attempts.
I have reached a point of political discharge.
The Republican blockade policy cannot declare why it is permitted to hear foreign government heads or to kill innocent children through drones in overseas.
It can't explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the life of Americans and is punished by whistleblowers that reveal public misbehavior.
It cannot declare why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, has been killed without procedures, or why the public finance and sea limits will be lost during the presidential election.
It does not justifie the results of a report that means that the efforts of the White House to relax the media are the "aggressivest ... since the Nixon Government".
And at the latest, it cannot excuse the incapacity of developing a simple website in more than three years since the discharge of the Abfordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood that government work could resist its previous political campaigns.
It is obvious that the Deputy's office is not a predictable course because a opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown Massacher are discussing public discussions.
But if I see the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely chosen by the Government itself.
And that's the most of me.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was pleased with his candidate.
Meanwhile, Romeney presented a confusing and unexpected alternative that he seemed not to be able to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second official time for Obama, free from pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope that we had heard for so long.
However, with the decrease of the approval values for Obama to be less than 45% this week, the return has become so stronger in 2008 by this book.
It is awakening in me the look at the many promises that have been solved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a severe loss against Clinton in the prevalences in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting with the electors after the decision, he told his employees that they should return to the course and follow their purpose.
"I want us to find our guy again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr President, and I could not accept you more.
The views set out in this comment are excluded by Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer said Premier Minister Tony Abbott had interest conflict on parents' vacation
The billionary and deputy Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his parents' plans because his daughters are pregnant and therefore can benefit from it.
The Mountain Baumagnat, which is in a judicial deal on the payment of 6 million ECU to CO2 taxes, set up the claim when he wanted to remove questions from the table if he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and Mountains are stripped or decreased.
However, Palmer claimed that only ministers could have interest conflicts and would benefit the daughters of abbott personally from the laws.
"He is in a large conflict of interest when it is about payable parents' vacation, because when one of his daughters get pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not, or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the election committee Palmer, with 53 votes Presp, explained after the renumeration of officially to the winner of the Sunshine Coast site of Fairfax.
Palmer requested a review of the voting process in order to make this quicker off.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Whether these elections should be decided two months after the end of the vote
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which you are marching the data in a computer immediately and then have the result at 6:30 a.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of bleeds in the marking of the voting notes.
Do you use them because you can raise the results if they don't like one?
Today, it is unbelievable to vote with bleasts.
The election committee has examined the options for a electronic election and recently published a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that it belongs to a international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office very seriously.
A public office is about the public service.
"We strive for no recompense except the story, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this Community," he said.
RBS suspended two divisors
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from their division, so two persons trusted in the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide investigation of the mute manipules racially takes road.
Some of the biggest banks in the world, UBS, Barclays, German Bank and RBS, assured that they cooperate with the authorities in the world's largest financial investigations, where 5,3 billion US dollars each day change to owner.
The two traders would be the first RBS partners who were suspended in the extensive investigation that the scandale was drawn around the Libor Interbank Business.
The Bank, who did not comment on the suspensions, assessed this month that it had received information requests from the authorities.
"Our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fullly with the FCA and other regulatory staff," the Bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, the nearby persons in the situation indicated that the RBS had transmitted the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier trader to the British supervisor, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and would, inter alia, have been allowed by its current position as a leader of the Forex-Spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, leader of the Spot Trading at Citi, was approved this week and Matt Gardiner, former leader of walls at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
No such traders have been committed to any misleading behavior.
The Instant Message Group of Usher belonged to the banks of Barclays and the citigroup, said the situation of nearby persons.
UBS gave this week that she took steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulatory officer Finma explained that she examined a mute manipulation of the devise in a series of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competitors Weko, the FCA, the US Justice Minister and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently involved in the projects which bankers should have been discussed in transactions on wallet.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPM Organ and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said to those trusted in the situation.
Banks through Instant Messages and E-mails from several years in search for cases of misbehavior.
The news about these investigations has placed the traders in a area in a deployment that has heard one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in the last years, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to play the business and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and highly liquid divisions, but leading traders believe that this was not essentially true.
A leader noted that, despite the enormous daily volume in the division trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trade platforms and the continuous use of its own internal platforms by banks leads to “the market with very small ticket prices”.
The message came out on the same day when Credit Suisse had given it, she announced this week to a trader of her London Exchange Traded Funds office after he had caused a loss of nearly six million / a week.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and informed them.
"We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is involved," said Credit Suisse.
The building on the Bechtle-based piece
A group of the citizen initiative "Switzer Wiese" has promoted the building on the Bejtle-based base at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
○ cleaned and broadcasted the foot, named in a press message.
The planned covering of the falling house in the back of the base was not allowed from security foundations because the area threatened to discharge.
Alfred Abel, who has now managed the baseline, had discussed the compensation action with colleagues Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the BI's action, a transparency with the message "We have been brought to it".
However, the 20 members of the citizen's initiative were few in their action.
His motto on the big plakat called "We are against Bauruine".
In this way, she wanted to point out the still greater ruins on the Swiss Pose - the project of rice should be cut off on one day.
In talking to many passengers before the building place, it was clear that some citizens believe that the reality of the city project will improve many, although few have the same questions to the size of the project as the BI.
But they start resigning because the city continues to delay these answers, it is called the BI.
As it was to hear, the public statements of the citizen's master are also affected.
May has said at the Community meeting that he has threatened the Termal Bad, the population should vote at the decision of the citizen against the plans for a Bathroom and Wellness complex on the Swiss Point.
Some seem to be too terrified, others feel as "plump pressure trials" in the population, it continues in the press communication of the BI.

Rangnick School for Chiris: There is no King of Swallow
Ralf Rangnick is so satisfied with the current form of the Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed by the Sport Director of "Bulles" by the directors.
"There is currently an annual trend that Mane and Alan will be forced to the Swealben Kings," he took the two officials in protection at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The youngest opportunity for Rangnicks critics was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Green on the last Sunday, when the senegales became a famous player for detention - which was freely not as the TV images showed.
"A crash failure decision," said Rangnick, the judge Harkam was "forwarded".
In addition, Harkam had "her part" to scale between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Green-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
His German Landsman defended: "I would have behaved like Roger Schmidt in each situation."
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with colleagues after the screenhouse with the guard.
I didn't know why.
"But I am the one who has been stumbled," stressed the 46-year-old.
However, in view of the successful course, Rangnick agreed with a lobeshymne.
"There are only two words: right well," he observed.
There's not much to exhaust.
In particular, the way the community plays is impressive.
That's what it's going to do.
Changes in the winter transition period will not be possible.
There are no wonderful reasons to change something.
"Except a player takes place with the desire he wants to leave the unit," Rangnick explained.
Supreme Court occupied Obama's health law
It is a big victory for the government of Obama: The US Supreme Court has dismissed today that the closely linked health law with Barack Obama is constitutive.
With five to four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to complete a hospital insurance until 2014 or to punish a penalty – is constitutional in the context of the State's tax efficiency.
The Master Judge John Roberts struck on the side of the four liberal members of the room, while the judge Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against them.
The Court also consulted the remaining sections of 2700 pages of the total legislation and also concluded that the standard of the Health Law, whereby the federal States should extend the conditions of access to medical medicinal products or, in other cases, all public medical adoptions, would not be constitutionally restrictive.
The procedure of complaint against law was forced by 26 federal states and the National Federation of Index Business.
The law was rejected by all the leading presidential candidates of the Republic, the latest prosecutor of the Mediterranean, in the pre-elective battle of 2012.
Norway: Norwegian place makes light with ries
With great mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian place have brought light into its dark valley.
As a result of the low sun incidence, the Rjukan located in the Westfjord number from Herbst to Frühling usually falls in the shadow of the round mountains.
With three huge reflectors in 45 meters height, a dream was true in the middle of the centuries.
"End!", heavy citizen Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremonie in the sender TV2.
Some inhabitants of the valley resorted to sunsets, others set up half-security solar blisters.
In the winter, sunshine hunger had to go on a nearby spring in the winter.
Age ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to bring the streams with mirrors into the valley.
However, this fundamental idea had been located since 1913.
After a multiannual debate, the town Council had decreased the project of 5 million crowns (approximately 615 000 euros).
Similar construction has produced the Italian Alpenort Viganella winter sunlight since some years.
Post is not empty on Sundays
"Multium citizens will not have not yet observed that the red points for Sunday Learning are still in the various letters of the city and parts of the city, but if you read the little printed at the yellow containers of the Post AG, you will quickly find out that emptying on sun and holidays is no longer located," shares the FDP.
A request from the FDP has made it possible.
On Sundays and Festivals, only before the post building in the 36-Srest-Ludwig street, and in Jacob-Mâer-Street 1 is empty in the tent field.
Whether to be emptyed on Sunday in Hofheim and Rosengarten, the answer to the FDP's request will not be answered.
The social and youth policy speaker of the FDP, Fritz R’enbeck, wants to be here.
Sunday training is just a important post service at the date of the appointment.
"This undertaking, despite the price increase in letters in January 2013, is radical and inconsistent."
Thomas Bittner, President of the Liberals Groups and Civil Conferences, supports his colleagues: "What makes me worse is the fact that the training times will be changed or severely changed here."
The post is remote from the nearby citizens.
"Bittner and R’enbeck unisono must be cleaned at least on Sunday."
In addition, for the Nuclear city, specially non-mobile citizens should be able to obtain a letter box with Sunday training.
Rõenbeck asked in the town parliament whether the city administration plans talks with the post on this matter.
Citizen Erich Maier answered that the post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
However, in Hofheim there is also a Sunday training.
Your party has already voted for Implementations.
"Then decisions are taken in another place," said Mayer.
Frankfurter Park taxes must increase strongly
Parks in Frankfurt may soon be sensitive.
The town's Magistrat discusses this morning on a proposal of the dezernant Stefan (Green).
The parking taxes should therefore be increased by 50 Pro.
However, the prices should not be highlighted, but the time range of parking hours and parking cars will be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the assembly of representatives must still be decided.
The IHK Frankfurt Single Trade Committee holds this "for no idea".
The parking opportunity directly before the business is "not to underestimate the benefit of smaller operators".
The German Foreign Club believes that a growth after two years is "adjusted and long-term".
The public navigation will also be more furious.
Rejoicing City: Quick action overcome guest providers
With a slight frame, Mrs I of the TSV city of joy in the Schiller-Cultural Hall in Reutlingen against the TG Gunnings from the Swedish Alb.
However, the elbers were with a experienced community on the other website.
But soon it showed that they, even olderly , were unable to maintain the rapid actions of the joyful persons .
With the hard and placed exhibitions, the gains were very difficult.
Repeatly, they lost the passports and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schools were purely played over the network centres and were not in place at the blocks.
Two higher first satch wines clearly reflect the overallness of the joyful persons in all matters.
In view of this impressive and playing performance, the seat was then winning a little slightly and disgusting at 3:0-end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a major strengthening enemy on the field with the TV Baiers source, which could clearly be carried out in Nagold on 2 November.
TSV place of joy I: Dominik Böuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pölchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, the second groups from Baiers source and the city of joy stood in the Murgtal Hall in Baiersbronn.
They offered a hard fighting two-hour-ma.
Nervosity on both sides caused in particular errors and point gifts when balling; the precision was also added to the steps, and in some critical scenes, the overseer prevented the potential point winning.
In this extremely balanced meeting, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto voted by the great physical use and a pleasant commitment of both teams.
Monitoring day at the small Indian household
In the middle of the fifth watch day, following the 2000 project of the top hottenwald, a group of employed participants met in the small English house in Ibach.
As a result of the advice from the population, it should be released to the valley on this day in the field of the tent of the corners, citizen Helmut Caiser said.
Others, like Caesars, were the part of the floor in which the landscape offers the ideal framework for wonderful views.
He thanked the present for their preparation for cooperation and stressed that the Watchtower Day was a suitable tool to strengthen human and natural connection.
He offers to every citizen the opportunity to put accents in the nature itself.
Similarly, with the tourist aspect, the environmental consideration can also be found.
This ecological aspect appeared to Frielike Tribukait from the Department of Natural Protection of the Government Presidency of Liberburg, as a result of the welcome by the Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken the screen rulership and wished to enjoy the action.
The tourist goal of the spectacle is, according to the Tribukat, with the objective of getting the highly grown old general field with its specific types of living rooms by opening and connecting to the still existing vessels.
Specific species such as rare worms and grass can not overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to maintain.
Tribukait said she wouldn't want to dismiss it at this place to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
In this plan, the current action is not only inappropriate.
A biospheric area also provides the opportunity to sustainable economics such as environmental development based on the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous completion of the future with the life project and the current monitoring days.
According to these various executions, revision leader Christoph and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the assistant in groups.
The larger trees have already been struck in the prevalence, the forest sticker is ready, if appropriate.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of watchbooks and the supervision of a dry stone roof.
The goal was the free view at the point of view.
Openings: Coppers still a single candidate

The application period shall be expired on Monday, 11 November, at 18.00 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei for Nortel patents
The group, the thousands of former nortel patents, strengthened on Thursday a lawine of complaints for patent injury against phone manufacturers, including Google, the company offered by him in the increasing Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium covered by the North Patents for 4.5 billion US dollars, complained Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies because of patent injuries before the U.S. Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is considered in seven cases of patent damage.
The patents concern the technology that brings the search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, so the complaint that takes place the noise of Google search machines.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstars were not directly available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC provide phones that work with Google's operating system Android, which is in scarce competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google granted a starting order over 900 million ECU for the north patents.
Google increased his boat multiple times and offered a lot of $4.4 billion.
After transferring it to the north patents of Rockstar, Google Motorola Mobility for 12.5 billion US dollars, a business that was also motivated for part of Motorolas library to patents.
“Although Google has failed with effort to buy the claim patents at the auction, Google has hurt the patents and has continued to do this”, as the complaint is written.
Rockstar requests a high damage replacement of Google, as it claims that Google's patent damage is evident, so the accusation.
Egypt requires the first freely selected presidents
Mohammed Mursi departs the office side, but his day of triumph may not mean the end of the political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was unified as the first freely chosen president of the country and thus followed Husni Mubarak, who had been destroyed 16 months ago from the office.
With his office before the Court of First Constitution, Mursi was also the first islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth government overseer since the spring of Monarchia was about 60 years ago.
He denied the oath before the 18 judges of the court clothed in black robes, who had his seat on the Nil and had found an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," Mursi said at the festival ceremonie that has been translated in public television.
"Today the Egyptian people have put the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brothership, a fundamentalist group, which has been taken in visibility since their creation of 84 years mostly as a prohibited organization by the Government.
Hundreds of soldiers and cops watch the building when Mursi arrived shortly after eleven hours in a small car convoi.
Only a few hundred attachers had gathered themselves before the court to join the new president, and contrary to the President Prunk from Mubarak's time, the constitution was held shortly so that the car convoi could overcome the usually used road that connected the city with the southern frontiers.
As the uncharistic "replacement" of the brotherhood, his personal Prestige has increased since victory and a Friday speech, not only as the Islamic candidate, but all who wanted to reach the efforts of the rebellion from 2011 against the authoritary Mubarak.
" Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," explained the judges in the wooden wooden room in a blue wooden clothing in a blue clothing with red crawatte.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Kairo, where he should keep his approach speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army capelle that played the national hymne that he listened to.
The military leader of the field marchal Hussein Tantawi was present.
When he arrived, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendants in the largest hearing room of the University with speakers of "The Army and the people are a hand".
The University of Kairo, created in 1908 as Bastion, developed to a islamist student group in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi sent a symbolic oath on the Tahir place, the birthplace of the rebellion that led last year to the end of the authoritary government of Mubaraks, and promised to require prejudicial powers that the military Council had taken by the head of the office.
However, with the derogation of the official ice before the Court and not as usually before Parliament, he refers to the will of the military, which indicates that the power fight will continue.
Mursis talked on the Tahir place was full of dramatic popular gestures.

Invasive in South Africa: two-fold detention
Nine months after a 17-year-old girl in South Africa has been condemned two-fold life-life workers on Friday.
This was reported by the sender SABC.
The victim died later on the consequences of severe damage.
John Kana was already found in the beginning of the week of crime for guilty.
The fact has been resolved in all countries.
At that time, the 21-year-old Anene Booysen in February, in a industrial village in Bredasdorp, near the capital.

The view of youths was so disappointed that careers and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had been assigned during the process, in fact night with booysen in a bar.
He also felt that he had killed and convinced her, but he decided to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had gone out of several acts, but two contemporary ones were taken out of the prison because the evidence was not sufficient against them.
In the course of the procedure, the State lawyer also pointed out that it was convinced that Canada was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa there are almost almost every day: each year there are approximately 64,000 proofs of sexual violence.
These are almost as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people are clearly more residents than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women associations in South Africa appreciate the dark numbers of sexual violence at 10-25 times.

16,000 cools per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fatta, colour: Uli explains ́s at the quality.
Most of the dogs are killed with six months.
TV with level?
More details such as the ph-value of the flesh play a role.
You darken the flesh, that's the ph-value.
"I'm stressed if you meet Roberto Blanco, what's then," so Jumbo is cynical.
Here the television level is presented in pure culture.

Did you think travel offices belong to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend.
The company has increased its victory for the whole year and expected recording of vacants in ○ and the United Kingdom.
The travel company now comes from a cleaned annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million, compared with 305 to 315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 Pro_, compared to the record winning of 290,4 million_ in 2011/12.
As the business leader Graham Turner offered, the flight center reached eight Pro wins in the first half year and booked a strong start in the second half year, especially in the Australian and British business.
"From the beginning of the year, our countries are profitable and some of them are on the road towards recording year's income before prices and taxes," he explained.
This includes British and Great Britain, which typically belong to our strongest results.
The free-time industry in the second half of the year has been obtained, which is an easily weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it was good for the free-time business of the Flight Centre in Britain, while there was less deducted business.
The U.S. work was obtained to the first half-year weakest season condition, so a winning for the whole year is expected for the year following.
The flight centres' actions increased by 3 cents to 38.20日 yesterday.
Schools are kept to be more focused on matthea, spelling and gram
In courses of English literature, students must be treated at least a part of Shakespeare, a Roman of the 19th century, romantic Lyrik and modern British Romans since 1914.
In the test, there are also “unvisible texts” input to read more.
The combined course from English literature and language is discarded.
Since 2015, students have to carry out an independent GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new teaching plans for English and Mateo tomorrow – the first feet that has been radically transformed.
Other nuclear boxes will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, responsible for tests, a new organisation of GCSE structures, will provide a new notation system and less course work.
In one speech in summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there is “a broad consensus that we need to reform our investigation system to restore the public confidence” and he stressed that the GCSEs would be "required, ambitionated and stronger".
Show that in English schools it is used less time for Matheo – 116 hours a year or three hours a week a year – than in most other countries.
At the same time, Australian schools train in average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal request to provide more time for Mateo in the hour plan, but from coalition circles it means that the comprehensive mathematical examination – accompanied with a stronger weight of the experts in Rhâlists – will urge schools to set more hours.
In the teacher plan, more attention is given to “the problems of the right life”, Finance Mathe.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the ecumenian vocabulary forum
In the next ecumenic vocation forum on Monday, 21 October, in the new museum of the closes, it is the subject "Zur Hîe with the Hîe - Theological considerations for today's trafficking with the last things".
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The ecumenic vocabulary forum is a initiative of the Catholic and Greek Church community Salem, of the closure Salem and of the cultured earthquake.
Johanna Rahner wants to follow the question in the forum, how people today set up the "last things" after death.
If the people in the past centuries had too much knowledge of it and were placed on those images of heaven and height, "which speak to our imaginations until today," the modern prophetic teaching of the hopes of finishing is more likely by a certain occasion or by a certain speechlessness.
"The greater hope is that Christians and Christians have been excluded by the religious criticism," says the referendum.
She has "we have so many questionnaires that we have seemed to have the call marks."
Johanna Rahner continues to say, "The decision-making challenge remains the danger of death."
This involves the question of such a view, "which dreams that at the end all may be good."
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden Baden, studied Catholic theology and biologic at Albert-Ludwigs University Freeburg from 1982 to 1989.
She promoted 1997 to Dr. Theol., also in Freeburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenic Theology followed 2003 at the Western Wilhelm University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has entered a teacher for systematic theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology of University Cassel.

Illmensee: Second Mountainbike Rounds Encouraging Participants
At the glorious weather, 214 carriers came to Illmensee to run the rate over the hill chains around the sea.
This shares Ulrich Knobel from the operating sportsverein Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially at the short distance of more than 15 miles and 300 miles [300 km], were a number of individuals who wanted to exercise their hobby once in wetcampathmosphere.
Two Junior leaders of the German Spitch class were also at the beginning in this wet battle: Felix Bader from Bad Wald See and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of places at the German Masterships.
These both were able to get out of the field expected.
As in the past year, Felix Bader could save a small time preliminary to the goal and defend his title as a total victor of the short distance.
At two places, Pascal Treubel could be placed again.
At the ladies there was Theresa Duelli from the team of Albtraum, who made it up to the winners.
In two and three places, Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A pleasant development is the continuing number of drivers who live or work in the congregation.
Not only as regards the performance capacity, the whole bandwidth of sporters was represented.
The older structure has also been available for younger than 70 years in the oldest starters.
In the main running this year, there were even more absolute topatholes at the beginning.
Four drivers were able to stop the regional riders.
Furthermore Philipp Pangerl, a Mountainbike assistant from the Black-Tusk-Racing Team.

Travelled by scrambs, flocks and dschungle for free medical supply
Dr. Georges Bwelle offers free medical assistance in apart villages in Camerun
Bwelle and his team carry almost every week to treat hundreds of patients
In the Western African country there are no many doctors, only one for 5.000 people.
vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him to "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George's Bwelle saw how his sick father was still lost his conscience and traveled to hospitals who did not miss the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was hurt in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the main city of Camerun.
First, he had only a broken arm, but then a burning that extended himself to his brain and caused a hematome there to affect him for his life.
"There were no neurochirurgs in Camerun," so Georges Bwelle.
We'd have brought him out of Camerun if we had got the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years to join his father in superficial clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five hours tomorrow and run to the hospital to be the first, and it is not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed since Bwell's father died 2002.
In Camerun there is only one ar for every 5.000 people, such as the World Health Organization.
On the contrary, the relationship in the United States is at an ari for 413 people.
However, even if there is an ar for them, most cameruns could not be allowed.
Two of the five people in the country live under the poverty border and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is the poor," says Bwelle.
And the poor makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many people suffered in Bwelle made the decision to take something against them in Bwelle.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his voluntary team have done 700 free operations last year.
He himself became Ar and ○ as a facility chirurg in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
○ He established a useful organization called ASCOVIME, which travels in rural areas and offers free medical provisions for the weekends.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he forces up to 30 people in small buses and walks with the accelerated medical equipment on the toilet over an unsettled area in the villages that need help.
It doesn't always leave everything unrequired.
More than once, they had to drive the vehicles through rivers and scrambs.
But when they come, they will receive as heroes: a festival, anang and dance and the best entreprenment that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical supply is really a reason for celebration and bone – with wide lakes and its free energy – is pleased at the joyful festival.
The next morning the team starts with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"We're going to treat 500 people," Bwelle.
They come from an envelope of 60 km around the village – and it to the foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical supply in a number of areas.
People are treated because of malaria, tuberculosis, undercutting, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmissible diseases.
Others receive cups, spent brilliants or free birthcurrents – a document that is necessary for school, but many poor families can simply not allow themselves.
On the evening the team performs simple operations with local competition.
The operations are usually located in a school, a room or a apartment; after the intervention, the patients arise and go into the recovery area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfektion equipment is split by the group generator and thus works Bwelle and his volunteers until the early morning morning.
It is a stressing pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They trumpet the whole night so that we can stay wake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, silent, but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixing from Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has done 700 free operations in the last year and knows that it has a great subdivision with her work for people to help.
One man explained that the free operation of a performance break that he received now allows him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
Besides the weekend clinics and his work as Chirurg in the hospital, Bwelle also night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his useful activities, such as Bwelle; it originates from private shalts.
"I really don't know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who studys at Drexel in Philadel Papa Medizin in the second year, and will be voluntary in Bwelles group.
He is always at hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and hospital students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and submit Bwelle, this is a chance to collect practical experiences that they would never get home.
"We can be in operations where we help to buy blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley states.
This would never be possible in America as medical student in the second year.
Students pay their travel to Camerun usually themselves and often carry out health material.
But if they are only in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes the delivery, transport and guidance.
"It's without doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameronian people does not know limits.
For Bwelle, the nearly continuous work is not charged.
To help others with a more happy life and to fulfill a promise he gave to his Father, he is a great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to bring people back to laugh and to wear the pain.

Excelles the fighting
The role of the Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut on the body of Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hate in meter, the art of showing.
The old man Santiago is not able to form something on fishing.
That's how the two simply becoming great.
It is almost thought to see the falls in the neck of the old man, of whom the fisherman Manolo is talking about.
When Santiago washs from life is sitting on the chair, it's real at Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisher is through and through a character role that Janson excitedly meets.
Hemingway told the story of a warrior, a courageous man who doesn't stop and finally through his own and also his willingness wins the fight against the fish.
Janson is in many ways as a solemn manufacturer on the stage.
He can focus the attention of the public on himself so that his monology is not a long-term moment.
His efforts to finally drag the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is only of blue lighted water flashes.
Regissor Jens Hasselmann allows the old man to act in the ship before the fisherdorf.
During the introduction, he sets the active scenes in the light: the tent of Santiago, the bar of the song Marie-Luise Gunst, which, with its lie and its glorious voice, has the life feeling of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba Rhythmus and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: Return to the Romans
On approximately 120 metres long is obtained a washing channel from the Roman time.
Whoever visits Köln doesn't end in the court.
Along with 157 meters, the two towers in the heavens and make it the second-third church building of Europe.
However, only a few of those who establish the two Philippines churches know that there is much to discover under the court.
Ra`s school is expert in Kölner's subjects.
The meeting point for his leaders is the service center of Köln tourism directly at Dom.
"We start in the deep garage," says Schulze.
In the seventy years, the town fathers wanted a autorighteous city, and therefore the old city walls remained just what was not too large.
Therefore, most of the users of the parkhouse are going to the Roman residues today and only leave their car.
But who looks more accurately discovers a archaeological foundation that is distracted by metal grapes.
See, there are about five meters high ruins from handsheet stones.
"The rest of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century after Christ," said Schulze.
Before it returns to the daylight, Schulze let the participants on the top parking level go into a dark, 15 meters deep ship.
This is the source of the ancient domain, which, unfortunately, is not to be seen.
The next station of access is the pretorium, and here the participants go back into the depth.
Here we experience the office of the one most powerful man north of the Alpes, the preacher of the CCAA.
What the CCAA means, a peer wants to know.
"The decline is for "Colonia ́udia Ara Agrippinensium", which, on the right of Germany, means "The city of Roman law and the city of the Agrippines, based under Caiser ́udius at the place of the altar for the Caesar's cult".
And the pretorium is the former townholder palace, the potential of the Roman Empire in Rhein.
From the front of the exhibition, a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater channel has been obtained at about 120 meters long here.
"You can slowly get a piece outside the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze urges the guests.
A surprise still has schools.
After getting the key in the box, he leads the group to a deep, accommodable ship of 16 meters.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish church built her bathroom deeply in the ground to come to the basic water that was indispensable for the ritual washing.
To this day, at the bottom of the Mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water conditions are disabled by changing pegels of the rain.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the road place for which building work should be started.
But until the finishing will be spent a few years.
Nearly covered legs: Reloading of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker mile is rerolled after more than four years.
A process for appealing to death, annual body damage and business damage against two 30-year-olds has started before the Court of Justice Frankfurt (or).
It is accompanied by strict security preventions.
The complaints are switching to the record.
They should be active in the rocksone and have heard the bandidos at that time.
The State Advocate proposes them to have income and insulted three men in a car in June 2009 with unrecognized complexities in Finowfurt.
All victims were severely hurt, a man had almost lost his leg.
The victims must have heard for the competitive grouping of Hells Angels.
One should be a high-range member of Berlin.
It seems to have been a persecution jack with several cars.
According to complaints, it was about revier fights and a power demonstration.
The two complaints were released in the first process in the beginning of 2012.
One judge said at that time that it could not be proved that men were actually shared in the bloody failures.
The staff had made masks and were not recognised.
The Federal Court raised the sentence after revision of the State official and refused to renew the Court of Justice.
One of the complaints is currently due to another delicity in the open road.
In particular, the restructuring of waste waste waste waste waste waste waste.
As a Witness, the direct Commissioner was then loaded.
In the center, phone talks were held by the complaints and other persons who had heard the police.
It is difficult that Rocker is almost always in the court of a law - and not in the case of them.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims was packed.
State lawyer Stefan Golfier from the State Advocate Frankfurt (or) said on a question that new tracks have occurred since the last procedure.
For the process there are elf further negotiations.
The traveling company doesn't think
The night was long, music sound and voting good, but once it's going home.
Only: In the books of people on the leader and backside, the hunger is notable.
Of course, he may be responsible for one or other cocktail or sect!
What is closer than choking to the next drive in to get a little bit?
I admire, I'm pleased to join it when it goes to the late afternoon, relatively early morning to feeding holes.
A few pommes, a Cola, a citizen - and then nothing like home and bed!
But on the home road, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco prisoners are observed.
For what must a man fail to throw his fixed feed sticks out of the car window with regularity?
In particular, on weekends, remote papers are located on road borders and on parking places.
"Why?" I ask me.
Are people too deep to take the tooths with home respectively to the next eye?
It's not just that the paper tools distribute the landscape.
Though it has already covered retail facilities such as guidelines, it has caused accidents.
About what the "Work Society" says but doesn't think, she probably does not even know what this word means.
If you're on the road at night, just with several people in the car, you know how a back bank can look after nights: clothes, bottles and other M°s are thrown there.
There would be no more or less to do, in contrast to the street, where no one wants to travel on the rest of the rest of the other.
I see the day when the cities and the communes will be bloody - and the feast-food cats must be required for their hot pend.
Obamas Responsibles in Health Policy
After a critical criticism, President Obama made a repeat at yesterday, often repeated, clear promises: “If you like your hospital insurance, you can keep it.”
Once hundreds of thousands of the insurer received an announcement letter, the Republicans forgot the President in the last days that he had doubted the public.
Obama related to his original promise yesterday.
"The major majority of citizens who have a functioning insurance can keep them," he said in a talk in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports to the cancellations, Obama requested the Americans who received such communications to review the free market after a new insurance.
Most citizens could receive such a better, comprehensive hospital insurance for the same price or more favorable than prognozed.
"You're coming a better boat," he said.
The Government was so surprising that the five Pros of the population who had completed a certainty themselves had to consider a different tariff, since their Treaty did not meet the new standards of the Abfordable Care Act.
"I want these Americans to say directly, "You have deserved better," Zebelius said in a hearing before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for the implementation of the Abfordable Care Act, explained that the beginning of the online platform has passed "miserable" since October.
"I'm also frustrated and woe as everyone else," she said.
I've been disappointed to win your trust again.
This statement of a Sebelius invoked to a council behind her sitting at the pressured hearing at the representative's house was adopted after a dispute with the Republican deputy Billy Long from Missouri, which would be binding to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeated the question why the “architectin” of the Affordable Care Act did not volunteer to a Stately promoted insurance to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to accommodate millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem not active attack on Syrian air weapons point
An anonymous government officer who wanted to remain anonymous said to CNN on Thursday, against the CNN of the Ananian newsman that Israeli campaigns would have attacked an airport point in Syrian Latakia on one day before.
The goal was "rackets and associated equipment" from which the Israeli government had promised that they were determined for the Libanese Hisbollah, according to CNN.
Eastern and Libanese media and the Arab sender Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the support point in Latakia's port city was shot on Thursday night from midweek, and the Israelites were responsible for it.
The israelian television channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, where russian divergences from type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 rackets, which, according to the channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry up to 70 kg.
Uncertain the Government in Jerusalem did not disappoint the attack.
However, the message agency Reʹs cites an anonymous Israeli government officer with the words he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but be not secure.
One speaker of the Israelian Defence Minister said at any time: "We do not comment on these reports."
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai, in the Daily Journal of Yedioth Ahronoth, stressed that the Syrian regime had already tried to deliver land-luft rackets to the Hisbollah.
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that every attempt to provide Hisbollah with chemical or other annual weapons means over a "rood line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unexpected statement that the U.S. Spionage has been "too far away"
John Kerry, with an unexpected unexpected consensus, stated an indication of the United States' depreciating view of their monitoring programmes, saying that the spionage was “too far away in certain cases”.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs also announced that he with Barack Obama had the responsibility to enable "autopilot" when the explosive enthings of Whistleblower Edward Snowden over the NSA spionages were public.
By means of the insured information, the US government was advised in a diplomatic storm of exhaustation from its associated members.
In a video connection on the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “I and others in the Government have learned about some things that have passed almost by autopilot, simply because the ability was to do what was on the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, on 11 September.”
Then, as the first high-range member of the US government, he agreed that the US spionage had exceeded a border, but also stressed that no rights were misuse.
He said, "In some cases, it has been too far."
The President has decided to create clearness, and therefore conducts a fundamental investigation so that no one must feel that there is a mistake here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
However, Kerry insisted that NSA is a power of the good and has been saved many lives by their monitoring operations.
He adds: "We have to do it with a new world in which people are ready to spread themselves into the air."
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is intended to kill people, to spread into the air and to attack governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it comes?
We have actually prevented aircraft, building attacks and killing people because we have learned in the case of such plans.
Instead, US legislators will travel to Europe to spread the thoughts against the traditional spionage and convince the Europeans of the need to continue working with the U.S. Anti-Terror efforts, as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for Affairs on Thursday explained.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their distress to not participate in anti-Terror organizations because of the frustration on the monitoring of the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the United States' national security interests that the Europeans remain on board in relation to our common efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is a democracy first in the senate and is a president of the Senate Subcommittee for External Relations and Affairs in Washington.
I go to Europe to clarify that we need to continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their difficulties on the NSA programmes.
Media reports, which the NSA has recognized millions of phone data in Europe, have charged the relationships with some United States, although the secret service leader explained that the reports were inadequate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by Nato-United and exchanged with the United States.
Other enthings quoted from Snowden transmissed documents, whereas the NSA monitored the phone of the Federal Canzler Angela Merkel and up to 34 other government overseers worldwide.
The leader of the national secret services, James ́pper, defended the spionage in the United States as necessary and explained that it was usually on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy, his authority, prepared the trip of the Congress to find place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and rooms.
The names of other participants shall be published in the next days.
He said the exact travelout will still be out.
Wonderful Murphy stressed that the purpose of the travel was to improve the relationships, he also said that there would be some "earliest words".
He said that the governments should be honest to their population regarding the type of spionage programs they used for years.
"How can we change our monitoring programmes and improve the rights of the Europeans, but they must also be with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy," so Murphy.
Thus, for John Kerry, a trip to the Near East and to Poland on the weekend, is a trip to get into the United States' role, Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States Monitoring Society.
A severe damage in the Sprungleenk threatened the use of Nicolai Mâer in the Federal External Game of FSV 05 to FC Augsburg.
It is a use of Nicolai M′er.
Tomorrow he's gonna try to train with the community.
So far he could only be individual.
"We will decide short-termly about his use," said Tra日 Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best ports with six matches.
Because they have to defeat the vulnerable Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
In Thailand, the chairman is committed against prison penalties
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced in Phuket for 15 days in prison because she had falsely claimed to be charged by a taxi leader, has made a prosecution against the sentence and was released to the accusation.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was already found by a provincie court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a falsuessage, after she had stated against the Thai police, a local taxi carrier had accused her in the morning hours on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men arrested them.
Later, however, the records of a videocamera showed that she was safe at her hotel after it was hit by her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket requested Bamford for two days until she was able to have exposed the story.
By the proceedings of the Court, she was guarded at the police office.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison penalty in a prison office with low security level at the border of Phukets, placed in a prison for awakened women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, an ancient player of the Australian Ruby Liga, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family was "extermly concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted to have her back in.
"We, of course, make great concerns, but we hope that it is home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has committed a vocation against the judgment and is against a cake of 50,000 bars on free foot.
In Australian reports, it was reading that it made a vacation at South Thailand at the middle of the vacation of Krabi in South Thailand.
From the sides of the Court was to hear that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the vocation could also lead to an offense of a penalty from up to two years in a prison for awake.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, after the recent murder of the travel café Michelle ́ith in Phuket, would have been attempted to improve his attacked tourist image, and thus it is a free charge.
