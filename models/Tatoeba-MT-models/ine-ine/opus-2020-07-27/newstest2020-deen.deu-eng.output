Brand deleted in French chemical work
The great fire was deleted in a specially-yearly chemical work in the Northern France City Rouen, which divided the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire was broken on Thursday night. Nobody was hurt in the case. The firewall was about 200 remote vehicles.
Containment could be offered to fire
The engineers were invited to not leave their households. Constructions were evacuated around 500 metres, schools and children's gardens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical work at its edge, additional materials for the mixtures are produced. The manufacture belongs to Lubrizol of US micro-armed Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU's Seveso Guideline, which provides particularly strict security arrangements.
In the work, approximately 400 people. The chemical factory was already provided in the past for shock lines - sometimes in 2013, when the gas methantiol was devastated and the surrounding environment was largely rocked to fauls eggs. In 2015, after a operational accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil waste washed into the city's water waste system.

Losses in the Federal War: Machine disorder disappeared unexpectedly
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six machine weights of the type MG3 are likely disappeared.
In the past years, the Federal War has lost numerous weapons and thousands of shoes munitions. There are also three machine weaknesses. The remain is in most cases unclear. The opposition speaks of a "terrible" dimension.
At the Federal War, weapons and munitions are always disappeared again - many of them are still in question. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have exhibited the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons, and almost 200,000 shops munitions. This shows a list of the Federal Defence Ministry, reported by Germany.
According to the paper from the Office of Defence State Secretary Peter Tauber from the CDU, two weapons, a part of the gun and 3474 Schuss Munition have been recommended. It includes six machine weapons of type MG3, eleven weapons of type G3, four weapons of type G36, six signal pistols and two weapons of type P8. Moreover, 30 weapons for machine weights from type MG3.
The range of weapons and munitions losses at the Federal War is "anxious", said the Left-Bunday Deputy Martina Renner. This was more, since it was almost found in the course of investigations. The left politician spoke of a "needs bi". The reporter criticized that the list could not be recognised whether there was any of those who were found in relation to the investigations against the Federal War of Franco A. "And this, however, was condemned by Franco A. recently because of the property of this munition," said the Renner.
Oiltanker "Stena Impero" left the Iranian port
More than two months after his establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oiltanker "Stena Impero" left the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As the observation data showed of refinitive, the tanker was moved and left the Iranian port. As a target gate, Port Rashid was indicated in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker was already released by the Iranian Government on Monday, but he continued in Iranian armies, and from the Reederie it was called to wait for an official knowledge from Teheran.
The "Stena Impero" was placed on 19 July by the Iranian Revolution Garden in the seaway of Hormuz under the plan to have violated security arrangements. However, it was assumed that Iran reacted to the obscured, temporary establishment of a Iranian oil tanker before the Gibraltar of Britain.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important seaways of the world. It connects the Persian Golf with the Indian Ocean. A majority of the global oil exports are moved through the sea. The spendings in the region have increased greatly in the past months. The trade ship was in the conflict between the United States and Iran. It has come to several intercourses with tankers and drones.
Markel appreciates the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
The Federal Conzler Angela Merkel appreciated the commitment of the people in the DDR, which had passed 30 years ago in the Peace Revolution. In heritage 1989, courageous citizens would have brought the old DDR regime to the wall, Markel said at a festack of the Thürringer CDU group on the next day of the German unit in Erfurt. The cancer reported, among other things, to the occupation of the Stasi Central. "The security of the State was taken from the fear," she said.
Musk stre · delivery records
Teslas Quartal may keep a record. Despite the delivery tree, there was later loss in the electrical control.
New York.Tesla-Cheef Elon Musk has electro-autoconcerns with the view of new record numbers strongly delivered on the bars. "We have the opportunity to give our first quarter with 1000,000 deliveries," wrote Musk in one of the brochure "Electre" published e-mails to Tesla workers.
The query is strong so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musks writings. The challenge to bring the cars to the knowledge, and then Tesla must offer as many resources as possible to the quarter.
Investors: Teslas shared with a plus of more than six pro-trade. The course has been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needed records to achieve his high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver 360000 to 400000 cars, which must have six numbers in the current and coming fourth year. In particular, the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here the winnings are low. Despite the tree, there was later loss.
Race solved: That is why we can't kitch ourselves
A kind of breaming in the Grand Heart prevents people to kiss themselves. These found actors of the Humboldt University in Berlin, using experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday, and they also have progress in the question why children are so intensely contrary to the kitsel only to ask more.
Sœ has also shown why only the nearby of a kitseling hand has already laughed before the touch. This is on a deep-leaving shit in the grandsheet, which already exposes the laugh at the waiting of the kitsel.
The report showed that races with "laughter" reacted in the ultrashal area when they were kissed by people, which is provided by the part of the larger winds, which serves of the central processing of the haptical observation.
Laughing will be undergone during self-sufficiency
Until now, the Berlin researchers have found that the brain between self - and touch can be distinguished by others - so that people can't kiss themselves. But now, in the experiments on the rats, the laughing was found like the A of the relevant area of the Grand Heaven River during a self-treat. This is also the way when life is put on themselves. The currency of the foreigner and the kitsel by the kitchens is to laugh the A's in the brain and the impuls.
But if you pass the self - touch and the touch by others at the same time, let the laugh also be subjected. This indicates that the brain of the race can not even distinguish between the self - touch and the touch by others. The new knowledge nearly placed that people couldn't kiss themselves because the self - touch activates a breaming in the grand.
The rats have also been trained to kitch themselves. In this case, they have sometimes declined this initiation in the experiment, showing flight behaviour or horrible stars. This ambition is equal to the behaviour of children. The ambivalence of the kitzel is a behavior reaction that is equal to rats and people.
Catastrophes Reverse: Great fuel in French chemical work
The great fire was deleted in a specially-yearly chemical work in the North France City Rouen, which shared the prefecture of the Normandy of the AFP news agent on Friday. The fire was broken on Thursday night.
According to authority data, no health careful substances should be issued. The samples taken don't give any reason to disturb, as the prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. Nobody was hurt in the case. The firewall was used with approximately 200 dish vehicles.
Schools and children have been closed
Inhabitants were invited to not leave their households. Constructions around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and children's gardens remained closed on Thursday.
Fabrik belongs to the company Lubrizol of US-Micardar Warren Buffett
In the chemical work at its top, additives are produced for smileys. The manufacture belongs to the company of Lubrizol of the US Mio-Arthur Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU's Seveso Directive, which provides particularly strong security arrangements.
In the past, the chemical factory has already provided for shock lines - sometimes by 2013, the gas methantiol was developed and the surrounding environment was largely rocked for fauls eggs. In 2015, after a operational accident, about 2000 litres of mineral oil waste waste waste into the city.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister

About Cox, which had been used for the remaining Britain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honour Jo Cox's and to restore this country would be to fulfil the EU's outcome." Cox was killed by a legal extremist during the 2016 election fight.
Monday to attacks of Oslo and Utöya is enth
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths in Norway will be enthusiased on Saturday a month to honor the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (Germany: the iron roses) consists of approximately 1.000 iron roses. They refer to the roses of thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Dom in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of artists Tob Malm and Tone Karlsrud will now be enthousiasmed - the roses have been cut off by people from all the world, including the survivors and members of the victims. It is expected to explore among other cronprince Haakon and Chron Princessin Mette-Marit.

Iran gives British tanker free
The United Nations General Debates did not solve in the Iran conflict, but now there is a less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could re-see. It could be a puzzle in the Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oiltanker "Stena Impero" held in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid July has returned to international army. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the Reedrei Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" left the gate of Bandar Abbas and the crew now led for medical investigations to Dubai, explained Reedereichef Erik Hå. On southday, the ship left the Iranian armies. "Soon that it's over," he said to the Swedish TV SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London covered the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of trying to affect the freedom of the sea, and we work with our international partners to keep the ship and the international law," it stated in a Friday message.
The Iranian Revolution Garden had established the tanker on 19 July under the proposal that they had failed the rules of marine law in the Persian Golf. Seven of the 23 occupational members were already released on the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were well, said Haá. They would have been conducted professionally in the past weeks, in view of the difficult and experiencing situation. The rider now works to bring them back with their families as soon as possible.
The British Government assumed a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar after the establishment of the Stena Impero: the beginning of July was a supertanker with oil from the Iran, which would have been determined to be put to the chat. The delivery was given to the authorities against EU sanctions against the war country. The reference to the ship had been received by the United States.
The Iran spoke of "piratery" and threatened with consequences. In August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was released. Mute measurements, it was a exchange business to get the "Stena Impero", which replaced London.
The Road of Hormus is one of the most important seaways of the world. It connects the Persian Golf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world's oil export is transferred through the sea. The spendings in the region have increased greatly in the past months. The trade ship was in the conflict between the United States and the Iran.
After the spending between Teheran and Washington, the atmosphere of both countries stands. The Americans threw the Iranian leadership to build atomic weapons. The Iran reveals it. The United States were in 2018 exalted from the international Atomic Agreement, which prevents Iran from building a atom bomb, and at the same time ends its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government sets the leadership in Teheran with massive economic transactions against the country under pressure to force a stronger and extended agreement in other areas. The Iran resists the pressure.
Because of the fight against the "Stena Impero" and other events with tankers in Persian Golf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States work at a coalition for military protection of the trade chiefs in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the street of Hormus at the United Nations full assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of hope" for the Persian Golf, Iran would like to ensure the security of the ships in the Persian Golf.
India has a better future with its protectionistic economic policy.
India would have been predicted to the "War winner".In view of the penalty of the President of America Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to re-distribute. Financial chiefs of Asian companies who make their production from China to another country calls India in an investigation of UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This is freely not only to play a more significant role in the invasiveness of the Chinese-American Trade Wars. With a riesen-pool of young work forces and a series of 1,3 billion consumers, India appears to be created in the worldwide production chain.
However, now India is conducted in Trumps Focus. From Haudegen in Wissen House depreciatedly titled "Reign of Zîtee" in the Sweden in June, America has made the trade benefits for 2000 products. The United States considers high ZÃ©e and requires a better market access to farmers, mobile phones, spirits, motors and others.
On the world map of trade wars, the Rivers with India are freely a neighborhood. In addition, America considers the world's greatest democracy by the security brilliant brilliant. Delhi and Washington are connecting the care of China's powers in the South Indian Ocean. In this context, a Salve-ananian penalty against India is unlikely. The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has reached a second five-year Office time, should therefore be safe.
The problem lies in another place: The empiry stressed These that open markets accelerate the economic development has a serious position in the socialist Republic of India. It is also under modi. Its reformer is mainly aimed at the burocratic irritation, which has reached too long every enterprise in the country. Companys now receive rapid construction authorisations for building. They benefit from a better energy and consumption infrastructure, and a more griping incurrence and competition law makes conditions to liquidate firms with high debt.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In the first five modes, in India, economic optical, many things have been improved, but in the trade policy it does not apply.
In the West, the Nimbus Modi of the energy reformer, which renewed its country in economically radically, is not due to the circumstances that the charismatic Prime Minister only knows too well what Vocabulary Managers like. In the kernel, the "India First" advocate never declined from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies to be forced to deploy anachronistic waste and thus fit for the global competition.
Joint by Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French State president Jacques Chirac will be assigned a report in the next week in Paris. The former head of the State will be placed on Monday on Friedhof Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, reporting the AFP message by vocation to the Chiracs family. The restitution will be located in a family circle. For Sunday, a public flight in Paris's invalidity was used, as reported by the media.
The competitors in the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Lightathletic-WM
The world's shot was already in the long time when Khalifa International Stadium played warming scenes. At the first time of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to swallow every year. He could hold himself almost 300 meters before the goal, run in unshaked attitude, as Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly understood him and dropped the last half stadium round to the goal. But the powers lacked at both to stop the looping armband tour after the goal. As if the scene had not been enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," Dabo said after running in Mixed Zone, when he was unexpectedly able to help the collected journalists. He was only proud to represent his country invited to the WM. In normal circumstances he would not even start. "I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
This he did at the evening with impression - and much more intense than he had thought of it. Because this heromat will remain in memory. At the same time Dabo left his competitor Busby even in the goal and voluntaryly took the last place - more well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this past. Successfully it had nothing, because the Busby only with a lot of help in the goal was disqualified at the end of the World Light Athletic Communication.
Dabo, who lived in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, came to establish a personal time at the WM in Doha. However, it sounds of adequate data with 18:10,87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was ago." However, only in training, there were no best time.
Millions of mass: Egyptians strive for a wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the prevalence of possible government critical protests. In the center of Kairos, there was a strengthened police presence on Friday. Several U-Bahn stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir place were locked.
In the past, the police had strengthened their road controls and shared the phones of footsteps on news and photos related to the protests.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last week it came to Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. They addressed the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critical corruption and misconduct. A such open protest against the political lead has not been given in Egypt for years. The Spanish Exil lived Egyptian builder and Shooter Mohammed Ali, who demonstrated with video boats on Facebook in the role, has been called to a "Million March" at central places in the country for today. Ali requests a "population". The man is also "G" because he was a sub-sector for the armies of millions, but his news.
The number of arrests in relation to the protests continued to increase. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organization of Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests.
Accommodational arrests
People were "concerningly captured" "only because they were "for wrong time at the wrong place", HRW shared in vocation on legal advocates. The prejudices against the arrested are given to their advocates from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist union". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities were asked and searched for security forces in uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW's information will be voluntaryly passed.
HRW also criticized the Zensur in the North African country and then blocked the government in Kairo Websites and online services to join further protests against Sisi.
Online Trade: Sachers need to return easier s.
For online marketers, many back-scale packages are lost products. About 20 million returns countries are so on the M. However there is a alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online negotiators such as Amazon and Zalando a way how they can destroy refunded products.
Although the company cannot be released from the tax on Sachs, the Minister explained a question of the Green Bundesday Group on which the newspapers of the Radio Media Group reported on Friday, but the sellers could make the market value of the unprocessable returns so low that they should not be able to pay any or only a few taxes of turnover.
For the purposes of the University of Bamberg, the federal citizens had found that on the Internet's orders, returned each sixth package.Four pro­perties of the goods - approximately 20 million products - then landed in M.
The Green Group Chairman Katrin Göring-Eckardt invited the Minister for Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify that enterprises can evaluate non-productive products respectively and freely useless organizations. The companies should be able to be punished not only for the online trade, but also for other businesses from loading to building.
Banksy art for auktion: There was never a better time to deal with this painting
The work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "The Parliament", will be increased.
For Brančik, the Banksys work underlines the "reformation of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world in the foundation of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting at Sothebys in the British capital will be made up until it is to be increased on 3 October. It will be estimated to 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first published in the British Museum of Bristol in South West in 2009, where Banksy le日. In this year, the artist had repeated the record - as well as the original Brexit date on 29 March. At this occasion, the work, which was called "Question Time", was renamed to "Deleged Parliament".
The image could change the owner for a million.
Premier Minister Boris Johnson at the midweek at the first meeting of the sub-house after a suspension of a force paused by Johnson by the Supreme Court had offered a hard exchange of the opposition. Johnson wanted to carry out the already moved brexit on 31 October, even without agreements with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, who is still unknown, has been mixed into the Brexit discussion. In Dover in South East England, he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks a star of the flag. The work sees thousands of Lkw carriers and others in the United Kingdom at the time of the entry into the United Kingdom.
Brexit discussion is like a "spacing in the park"
The convinced verbal attacks of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit-Gr in Parliament in view of his adviser do not participate in a climate of the hate. In comparison to the vote fight before the Brexit Referencement 2016, the current controversy is a "spacing in the park", Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book proposal. "We enjoy it. We will go out (from the EU) and we will be won."
Johnson had severely attacked Brexit-G ́r in Parliament in the past days, including the "tradition" of the people, accusation that he could bring the members in this way because they could be about the purpose of murdering, he dismissed as "Humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to restore rest is if the Members would finally respect the decision of the British for a EU exit, and it is not surprising that the people were pointed out that the United Kingdom has not yet come out of the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the vote invoked on Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church cried to keep. "We should talk with respect," he said in a claim. "And we should listen to it."
President of Pakistan Khan requests an uno intervention in Kasch.
With a emotional call, President of Pakistan Imran Khan again invited the United States to intervene in the Kash conflict at the first stage before the Uno full assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between Pakistan and India is probably likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General debate in New York. "If it is bad, you hope for the best, but you are prepared for the worst." The United N° would have a responsibility for Kash. "You should have prevented it."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from the British Colonial Government in 1947, two of them to the divided region Kasch. Both atmosphere rule each part of Casch, another part of China. In August India, the Indian Cascha region had taken the autonomy status and thus increased the spending in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrants in Kairo request the trumpet of the Egyptian President Al-Sisi.
On the current protests in Egypt, the Government reacts hardly. It allows the people to shoot strictly, arrested over 2000 in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners already in Egypt. Protests have never been unnecessary in Egypt. However, since the overtake of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the State facility has made everything to avoid a scenario like in the days of the Arabic Presidence.
However, one of the protesters was the bad economic situation. Poverty, perspectiveness and the feeling that the Government has been exhausted by his own government opened millions on the street. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi doesn't get into the grip, regardless of how hard it happens against the opposers. The situation has even hurt.
Today, every third in Egypt under the poverty border. Since 2016 the wall has lost more than the half of its value, the inflation rate is located at Property Pro. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in Super ́ must decide who financed: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The last one is not only responsible for underpressing but also the greatest economic actor. The military builds roads, hausers, football stations, produced food and more. This was already before el-Sisi. With authors, the Egyptian people have many experiences, also the dilemma in super Property. Critic will always be when large parts of the population have difficulties to provide a flat water.
Thieve tests in the terminal: BER-Cheef: No "showstopper" anymore for main city airports
Two months have been checked whether the complicated installation dilution works at the BER burning protection. The operators are satisfied with the history, but the Tüv is not finished on BER.
Following greater Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators visited the planned execution in October of the next year. This is safe, after a meeting of the Control Board, the Supervisory Board Ra _BAR_ Bretschneider said.
Anglebert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a complete test, but said that there was still a lack of work in the terminal. "We have many details, but we have no real showstopper." He assured that the time schedule contains a buffer.
However, there is evidence that the time reservation should not be too large, and the construction indicator is now to be submitted to the building at the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, which was intended for this inheritance at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of deficiencies of electricity cabines are still to be decreased; the Tüv wants to check them until February. "To create the conditions for the reception of the flight operator, it must continue to be intensively in the processing of the deficiencies," it stated in a written message.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cabs. There is no release for all the depths in which the cabs are involved. The airport head expects that this will be forward to the end of the year.
The burning protection works in the transition to the bathroom under the terminal. The problems have led the project to another crisis for three years ago. This time is about smoke shorts that fall down at a burning like a linwand, so that the smoke does not spread. They are going too far down. 36 engines have to be exchanged, so there will be a new trial of the year.
Problems with fuel protection and other tree angels and planning failure have delayed the planning of the airport for years. In the beginning of 2006, the costs increased from two billion euros to approximately 6,5 billion euros to exploit the next year.
Since the passenger numbers in Berlin have been clearly identified, the responsibility plans for the development of the aircraft, so it should be held at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the President announced.
The airport company now looks for two new business leaders. Financial chief Heike Fölster changes the end of the year to the German train, personal boss Manfred Bobke from Camen goes to the rent next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster.
Chemnitz: Automats for split - Police takes a man

But it is sure that the growth of the number nine of the British Trone Sequence and the Immobilious Mogule will be a similar great festival like the swelling of Eugenia on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
causes of heart diseases
smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for heart-crossing diseases. But what is a heart weakness or an infarct really out? Hamburger researchers now want to look at the inheritance of 9000 healthy and sick people.
With regard to the analysis of the inheritance of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss communists want to find the causes of heart circulation diseases more detailed.
The research project is the largest of this type in Germany, and the University Clinic of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) shared on Friday. The Khoune Foundation promotes the preservation of 12,5 million euros. From Switzerland, the high-birg clinic Davos belongs to the Foundation, and the University Citizen Zürich.
Overweight, smoke, and unhealthy nutrition includes the essential risk factors for heart crucial diseases. Genetic diseases determine the risk. However, the comparison between genes and external influences is only inadequate, said it. Now the creators want to compare the full inheritance of 8000 healthy people with the former 1,000 patients of the University of Heart and Equipment at UKE.
Currently, more than 4000 of the 200,000 relevant human genes have been possible illness changes in the DNA, called Mut. It was called from the clinic. Each year, about 200 are added.
The objective of the five-year project is to develop the initiatives, such as the prevention, recognition and treatment of heart-rhythms, heart weakness and heart infarctions. The data can also benefit from researching other people’s diseases, so that Stefan Blankenberg, leader of the Universal Heart and Features are possible. New recognition of the compatibility between heart and brain, heart and renal diseases and cancer diseases.
The president of the Küne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Küne (82), also stressed that it was the strong will to use the data for research of other diseases. The Clinic of the Foundation in Davos was treated up to the most of all allergies. Now there was a centre for cardiovascular precision medical medication and was created a professor for bioinformation. To motivate his commitment, the logistic undertaking said that he was operated three years ago in Hamburg in the open heart and very thankful.
The biological samples of the healthy participants are of Hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 probands, it is the most local health study in the world, according to the clinic. In the inheritance encryption, it is considered strictly to protect the anonymized data, the guardians. It is about a petabyte (1,000 terabytes) to data, said Holger Moch from the University capital Zürich.
The inheritance of a person today can be decrypted within 24 hours. The pure samples are 1300 euros. The first gene sequence of the world, which has been published in 2001, has increased hundreds of millions of euros, which will begin on 1 October 2020, all 9000 samples will be analysed, and the first results will be expected in the year.
Nigerian police delivers hundreds of missing boys
In Nigeria, the police had followed more than 300 and missing kids from a Coran School. According to the indication of residents searched for security forces in the northern Caduna city and discovered the victims of minor years, as the police speakers of Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were miscompressed, some of them suggested that their teachers were disappointed," said Sabo.
The boys were arrested under the prejudice to be instructed in the Coran and "bessed". In fact, their teachers were arrested under "the most valuable and unmanual conditions", said Sabo. About 100 students, including children of nine years, were in a small room.
The Coran School was aware of the information for about ≥ ≥ years. Inhabitants would have noticed the authorities on repeated irregularities in the establishment. The parents would have shown themselves shocked when they were informed about the situations in the Coran School, said Sabo. They would not have felt of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the major Muslim North of Nigeria, there are many private corancills, which are often replaced by the deficiencies of State institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed bands. According to the United Nations refugee assistance work, there were more than 40,000 people in the past months over the border of the Netherlands State of Nigeria.
Elected and followed: Nigeria police frees 400 children from school
In a school in the north of Nigeria, police have released almost 400 students from distressing conditions. "Several of them were packed and some have seen injuries that indicate folters," police speakers Yakubu Sabo said in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after an indication in a islamic school. The conditions there were "human" and the officers adopted the school leader and six teachers after the release action.
Children, all boys, were held in their school as slaves and were placed on chats. Some have been sexually misuse. Television images showed disappointed and hurtful students in a recognized bad health condition.
World Football Choice: More forwards after Messis and Klops
Football "invalid signature"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a Gala in Miland, the World Football Connection Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best tragedy of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain explained that he never voted in the world football election, he came from other countries to the Fifa. Egypt was not assessed with a motivation.
In the past years, Fifa has shown himself as an advantage: the WM contracts, the dubios plans of her President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt functioners. However, the fifa-Weltfootball election does not run unclean - if the voted nationaltra and national communities of the members of the community often vote before the Sympathy after an objective estimation.
However, after the Captain of Nicaragua has already complained that he has not voted, there are now further injustices: Egypt complains that the voices of the Nationaltra of Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account in the official and publicly uniform voting overview.
The Fifa is sorry that "the signatures on the election forms were issued in large letters and therefore were not valid"; the Egyptian link has been contacted several times to clothe the situation without answer.
Sudan Tra also amazed
Moreover, in the Sudan, there is a claim about the choice. In the case of Egypt, the sudanese association suggests that Traë.24ko Lugarisic did not vote as it was evaluated: with Lionel Messi on place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote has been introduced in the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese band.
The proposals also said Captain Nicaraguas Juan Barrera: "Have not voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my voice are wrong, thanks," he wrote. In ́s case it was considered that the Nicaragua football band simply voted in ­ name.
From the band was now the report: True, but of course it was no intention. The election records were "irreally" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the Captain of Nicaragua's election, called it in a communication of the band. However, he chose the second Captain Manuel Rosas. "We assume the responsibility for the administration failure," he said in the communication. As Rosas and the manshipstra_ Henry Duarte would have voted for Messi, "all as it is in the official list of the FIFA".
The other cases allow the Fifa to check in an investigation now, but it emphasises that the election process was observed outside the PriceWaterhouseCoopers advisory form. As long as Lionel Messi remains inconsistent winners of the world football election and Jürgen Klopp Worldtra of the year.
Ukrainian Affairs: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
"I think that the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the United States State Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where it comes from here, it will be determined by those who have been detected." He wants to know more about the whistleblower business before taking measures. A procedure of impeachment can lead to the cancellation of the president.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the enthings, which showed that Trump had repeatedly invited the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to examine the activities of the Democratic President and the former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have so far rejected the criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower business, only few have recognized unpleasantness. Scott's comments are now the first sign of it in Trumps Party, which has already been committed by the Moderate Governor of Virginia against Trumps, such as the locking of environmental protection rules and the decreasing of immigration rules.
As another stricter Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, said to the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right procedure and responsibilities for the Congress are now to investigate the matter and to go on the basis."
Scott and Baker, as Governor of the United States, have not formally been involved in the procedure against Trump, which is decided in the Congress, therefore their comments are symbolically important. However, the first Senators of the Republicans have expressed themselves critically about the situation.
The business could take place in the introduction of an official procedure against Trump which the democrates in the representative house have announced an investigation, which provides for the use of power in order to influence for their own political benefits.
There is no precise time schedule for the Office. With the majority of them in the representative house, the democracy could strive to make such an impeachment. However, the decision on a real derogation fell in the seat where the Trumps republicians have the majority, so the views on the success of such a procedure are low.
Folters were on the board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicilia and have been murdered in Libyan refuge camps.
The German Captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after the Saving Board "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board had not allowed the port of Lampedusa. After heavy protests and international critics - also by the Federal President of Austria Alexander van der Bellen - was revoked by a Italian judge after a few days.
Now new severe prejudices against rackets will be sounded. Three men whose folters are presented in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The contemporaries have been seated in a recording camp in Messina (Sicilia) after the migrants have recognised their peiners in Italy. "We can't exclude it, but even have no safe information about it," said Ruben's speaker Ruben Newbuilder of the German Presse Agency.
From the police, the mid-September called that the disputes in the North African country were convinced, covered and even killed. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptian Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematicly schicanized and excluded green acts - by repeated and continuous physical violence," it said in the communication.
NGOs and help organizations now indicate that they can't know exactly who comes to the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They come without pass," said the rebuilder. Folter is one of the main foundations why people flee from Libya. Therefore, it's probably likely that there are also workers on the ships. "It's very important that it will be followed."
The Italian Executive Minister Matteo Salvini requested a immediate excuse against rackets in Italy for the aid to illegal immigration.
Musk stre · delivery record in Tesla
Tesla-Cheef Elon Musk has offered electrical car controllers with the view of new record numbers powerful surface on the boats.
"We have the opportunity to give our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in one of the "Electre" e-mails published in the brochure "Electre" to Tesla workers.
The request is strong so that Tesla could book 10,000 orders, it continued in Musks writings. The challenge is to bring the cars to the knowledge, so Tesla must offer as many resources as possible to the quarter.
Investors: Teslas shared with a plus of more than six pro-trade. The course has been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95,000 cars and so reached its best value.
Musk needed records to achieve his high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars, which must have six numbers in the current and coming fourth year. In particular, the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here the winnings are low. Despite the tree, there was later loss.
US Budget conflict: only renew a bridge financing
The new budget year will be started in the United States on 1 October without a regular budget. The Senate followed the representative's house on Thursday and has concluded a transitional financing until 21 November.
Though the Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to the increase in the time limits for the budget year 2020 and 2021, the United States remained before the new fishing year starting on 1 October once again. The Senate followed the representative house on Thursday and had a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision would come to a Shutdown midnight, a subclise of the Federal Administration. President Trump must still enforce the decision.
Shutdown disabled
The federal administration at the level is currently financed and with the priorities of the budget plans for the end of the moon 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to reach the 12 departments and authorities, which allow the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot first benefit from the new budget year of 1.3 Bio. to 1.4 Bio.
The democrats in the representative house, where they have the majority, have fulfilled the twelve laws, but the gate seats reflect the priorities of the democrats who have no chances in the senate dominated by the Republicans.
The spirits are especially separated in the subject of the Association of Resources for the Internal Safety and Border Security area. In the Senate, the Republicans are trying to force 12 billion dollars for the building of the wall, one of the great priorities of the President Trump. The democrats spend to the wall buildings and their finance for other military buildings and projects. The fight against the wall building was already scaled in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
In the wall building the spirits are separated
Now it is unclear how the parties want to draw close to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve hours in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing on 21 November.
In the light of the persistent incapacity of the Congress to take part at the twelve hours seats, and the incoming ideas of a Shutdown winning for automating the process of popularity. Model S. 1877 on the avoiding Shutdowns would continue the financing of the Federal Administration at the previous year, underline the travel activity of the Parliament and stop their wages until the new annual payments are presented.
France allows artistic comfort for lesbs and Singles
In France, artificial inquiry will also be opened by single women and lesbs: the Paris National Assembly agreed with a large majority of the Government's legislative proposal for all women to be able to take an in Vitro inquiry, which would be clear to the request for anonymous seeds.
In the three-day emotional debate, criticians in the right camp had warned that in the future many "children without father" could rise. The French Bishop Conference is also against the newness.
The new regulation is the essential component of a bioethic legislation, which defended the health minister Agnès Buzyn as a "chance" for the society. It represents the modern family in which it provides children with only a parent or homosexual parents.
Prohibition with sperma of dead husband continued
With a short majority, the national assembly repeated a amendment that the widow should give access to the sperm of her dead man. In Others, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artistic visit "post-dead" is allowed. In Germany, in the past, there was cases in which women were fairly complained about the exhibition of the sperm of a corrupt man. The enemies of the prejudice in Paris argued that a child so born would be a "severly severe shock."
However, many members of the Governing Party La Republic en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition were expressed for the artificial relief with the sperm of the devastated partner. They emphasized that a widow would have a "double triumph" if her husband's death remained inherited.
The initiators of the currently malformed amendment believe that a widow may be able to gain fruit with the sperm of an unknown but not with its own partner.
To this end, the artificial conquest in France is allowed only to heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together at least two years. Buzyn had already announced that the maternity continued to be prohibited in the summer.
In Germany theoretically, the artificial promotion of all women is open - for alone or lesbian couples it is often difficult.
Compensation for climate: Calls after aircraft for Unis become la
The high schools will be a lot of logs, so the country will be able to bring a climate tax in the future, and the directors say that they have no money for it, but now they have also advised inside pressure.

The debate on a climate delivery on flights of universities and high schools is renewed before the summer pause. After the Conference of Countries has responded skepticly to an appropriate advantage from the green and black coalition, the plans now receive support from the high schools. In a common declaration, the doctors are placed by six bath-wurth-school universities and a padagogical high school for compensation of services. This is the first step "driving need", at the same time, it must be given a wide debate on the avoidability of flights, which is in their opinion. The initial Cabinet decision already scheduled in July is still on ice because the CDU has not yet taken the model of the green.
Russia takes the North Korean fishermen again
According to the secret service FSB, the arrested in Russian armies had to have been arrested. Ten days ago, 161 fishermen from Northern Korea were captured. At that time there was a shift between the borders and the ship occupation. Three Russians and a North Korean were hurt, the fisher later took his serious damage. But this time there was no damage, said it.
The Communist Northern Korea suffers of chronic lack of food and then the North Korean fishermen were on the road in Russian coasts, where the coast guard of Russia is guided by its own information to protect their multi-biological resources Patron.
30,000 tissues obscured
In the renewed controls, 30,000 tonne fish were discovered and arrested on the ships. . The information was arrested by three fishing and two motor ships and brought to Nachodka and posted at Wladiwostok.
Russian fisheries audiences also have not been issued to the Northern Korean fishermen in this year after claims of domestic enterprises. Thousands of Northern Korean fishermen have already been arrested in this year.
The leader of the Russian Fishing Business Association in the remote region Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently complained about high environmental damage by the Northern Korean fishermen. They fished with engmassed synthetic networks in Russia, which would also take small livestock from the sea, and the networks would simply explode in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
Only 18,000: United States reduce asylum border
The "greatest nation in history" is Donald Trump, here at a meeting with selected police officers in the White House.
The richest country of the Earth is shooting against protectors: As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington, the above limits for the legal movement of refugees will continue to be decreased. The future will receive threatened believers and Iraqian Asyl, especially.
The US Government wants to decrease the historically low limits for the introduction of new refugees. In the financial year 2020 in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, at least 18,000 people must be left in the country, as stated by the United States Foreign Minister.
The Government of President Donald Trump has drasticly reduced the preparation for protection seekers from all the world in the past years. Under the pre-regering of Barack Obama, they have been able to acquire very much.
The above limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the United States refuge programme in 1980. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs covered the United States as "the most merciful and greatest nation in the history", a formulation which highly refers to the use of the US official President's language.
Trump explained that the refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuild there. For his hard course in the migration policy, he has a lot of accusations from the candidates, but there is also a massive criticism.
A great conflict point is the border to Mexico, which wants to cover Trump. To be able to finance the building of a border wall, Trump had declined the national need. If there is a timely connection between the current action and the current internal developments in the US capital, it is unclean. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selensky business and a possible threatening official depreciation procedure.
The Government of the United States will, after presentation from the Office of Foreign Affairs, make it possible to take into account two refuge groups: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Irakers who have helped the US military in the country and who have been consulted by it as shown by the Declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the contrary, from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, they will take up 1500 refugees.
The United States want to find that people from this "North Triangle" Central America in other countries are asyl. In this context, the United States have only concluded with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements in order to join the migration at the southern border to Mexico.
Court orders the release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An Orang-Utan woman has been moved to a station for human appeals in the United States on the requests of the argentinian justice from the former zoo of Buenos Aires. "Sandra" was given in 1986 in Rostocker Zoo the rights of a "no-human person", so it was forced to release them. The animal was brought on the day on the day of direct flight to Dallas, but not as a passenger, but in the frachtraum, as advocate Andrés Gil Domingguez explained.
Since the 53 kg of harmful human affinity is not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, it will live in the future in the Freedom of the Centre for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orang-Utans and 31 shimpans, among them "Bubbles", before the house of Popstar Michael Jackson. But before incoming in Florida, "Sandra" must be a 40-day quarantine in Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the United States of Cansas.
"Sandra" passed a few years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsen Church before it was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process called "Sandras" by the animals was encountered by 2014 to make the zoo of Buenos Aires transformed into an ecoparc. To 2023, there will be a research and educational place to obtain the variety of species.
Record for Swiss Extremberg stepper: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extremberg grower Dani Arnold has a new household grade at the nearly 3000 meters high wave in the Italian Alpens.
Without a net, double ground or other aid tools, the Swiss wined the 550 meters high north wall of the large wall in a new record time.
Dress with Jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute freedom of wheat, Arnold needs 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the growth. That is what he offers the oldest mark about about 19 minutes.

Nike benefits from a new online construction strategy
The U.S. sports producer Nike has reserved a clear profit from the trade conflict with China. The net wins increased to 1.4 billion euros in the past quarter (approximately 1.3 billion euros). This is more than 25 per per cent than in the previous year period, as the Concern reported on Tuesday. In particular, the new conciliation strategy "Nike ́", with which the adidas competitor directly returns to his customers.
The circuits increased in the three-night period until the end of August 10,7 billion. In the most powerful way, the Nike sales payments increased with a plus of 22% in China. This benefited from the concerns from Beaverton in the United States of Oregon, also in the People's Republic of the Internet or Arcphone Apps.
Financial Boss Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue with strategic investments to promote the "digital transformation" of the sport article manufacturer and thus develop his competitive benefit. The investors reacted pleasantly to the quarter numbers - the actions of the sport article manufacturer increased by more than five Pro.
Lifelong Stadium Prohibition for Rassism in Italy
Because of racist comments on the football profile Juan Jesus of AS Rom, the United of the Italian capital has committed a long-term stadium prohibition against a fan. The defensor from Brazil was emphasized by the Fan on Instagram. Jesus published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialsroma You know already what you should do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Stout on being who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who plays in AS Roma since 2016.
The United Nations reacted on the latest Thursday.

Rassismus is a problem in the Italian football. The Italian fans regularly shame racist emphasis against black players of rivalising men. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and it is very serious. It is necessary to identify the responsibility and throw from the stages," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. Instead of the exhibition, there were racisms at the first party between Atalanta Bergamo and Florence on the previous Sunday.
However, about the attachments of Juventus Turin, there were recent discussions. The Italian authorities now have 38 randalising fans of recordmaster Juventus Turin with stadium prohibitions. Four of them could not attend the stadium for a period of ≥ ≥ 81 years, the police shared the police. For the rest, the prohibitions of four to seven years are therefore applicable.
The fans are associated with current investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra-Fancs in the area of Juventus. The twelve are included in a severe pressure, money weapons and private violence. The club has introduced the investigations with an announcement last year.
The Ultra leaders were to put after Italian media reports behind the black trade with tickets. They had the ticket trading for the fan curve "militaryly control" and would have pressed Juventus collaborators to reach more favourable cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different than generation Y?
Millennials are nazistic, the generation Z is political - all the years are covered with accurate labels. If you look more accurately, the expressions are full of opposite. So how well are these labels described by the life feeling of young people?
"The cancers come!" With this call, on September 21, officially started the cancer catch at Gucheng-See in Gaochun, including the 19th executive event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake'b Festival, as was stated by the Division for Public Work of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, who is the South Exploder of Nanjing in the Jiangsu province, is one of the national environmental areas. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city is available in environmental view of ideal conditions with a mixing of "30 Pro > mountains, 20 pro pro ́ Water areas and 50 per per ́ fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers to his people all conditions to become rich.
The people in Gaochun have already started in the early 1990s with the cancer. During the time, the cancer industry has developed to a pleasant branch that provides high income and has become a major part of Gaochun's economic development. In the past years, Gaochun has actively developed a large, ecological and scientific development of the cancer and a technology-based cancer, and the city has contributed to the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the income of agricultural farmers.
In the past years, Gaochun has made a reform for the "distribution of power, optimization of administration and of authorities" and with care the service network for "approval under a dach, a team for criminal persecution, a network for services, a credit transmission platform" and will enhance the environment of authorisations, services and development.

Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of the end of the sanctions - Trump corresponds
The Iranian president Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the United Nations full assembly, spoke of an advocate of the United States to repeal sanctions. The United States would, in contrast, have made an end of all sanctions on his official website for talks with the Teheran Führer, explained Ruhani.
US President Donald Trump, however, opposed the Iranian official colleague on Twitter: "The Iran wanted me to cancel the sanctions against him so that there was a meeting. Of course, I said no."
Ruhani skilds the event as: the Federal Concern Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and would have caused a meeting to find place. "And America says that I have the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of penalty measures to be completed have been debated. "And they have clearly said that we have all sanctions."
However, if this obstacle is not done in a acceptable way, criticized Ruhani.
In the beginning of the week, Kanzlerin Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of the Europeans to save atomic agreements negotiated with Iran with Russia and China. This would stop the Islamic Republic from developing atomic weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron had the hope that Ruhani would be met with President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 neighbors
After the west Turkey was shot within the latest time by two earthquakes, where the most before a disaster. 34 people were hurt at the earthbub on Saturday. Since the baby was given almost 200 neighbors, the Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said on Friday, so the concern was given before a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed from security foundations, and hundreds of buildings were then protected. The earthquake of the force 5,8 had shot the Marmer region before Istanbul and solved panic in the million meter pool. Now the Government wanted to set a Commission to prepare the country better for the land, announced by Oktay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for bebes, said Istanbul's citizens Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the leaven will always be ignored again. Each year, bad building houses are cut in - including murmure made by the many smaller landscapes that shoot Istanbul regularly.
Cities planners such as the Architectin Mücella Yapici have warned for years that large open areas in the centre of flights have been built longer. On the 20th day of the Golf Baby in August, Istanbul's building room had warned that a million of buildings in Istanbul were not insured.
The epi'rum of the bebe from Thursday was in Marmarameer before the district of Silivri and in about seven miles deep, as the disaster protected afad reported. A small neighborhood was a few minutes later for even greater panic on the streets.
The Istanbulian citizen Ekrem Imamoglu shared on Twitter with, injured or damage was not reported. The state sentence of TRT showed people who broke from the houses in panic. Schools were brought out of the buildings in Silivri's area. Some students weeped as on images.
Istanbul is used as a particularly earthquake. Under the Marmarameer is a section of the so-called North-Anatolic Supplement, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth. Turkey is still being shot by earthbubs. One of the most deadly babies was in 1999 in the nearest Istanbuls. At that time, more than 17,000 people were survived to live.
Scientists claim that a earthquake of the force of 7,1 to 7,4 could be threatened, but when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclean. At the earthquake on Thursday, it has already met the west of the country and the Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, so-called Go-Bags have completely packed with all the needs at home doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wakes. When the next big babe comes, be unclean.
The Turkish president Recept Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people were hurt. Some buildings would have suffered easily damage. The Istanbuler citizen Maester Ekrem Imaoglu followed the developments of the Istanbuler Catastrophe Coordination Coordination (Akom) (Akom). After its information, two minerals of Moscheen were cut into the districts Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning before posting in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Building. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone guides were interrupted. It was more urgent than the Sunday, writes a user. The leader of the Turkish Red Halbmonds, Kerem Clinic, warned Twitter before the neighborhood. He invited people to stay away from buildings that would have suffered visible damage.
The date of the babe is given by official information at 13.59 hour (local time). Only a few minutes after the first babe, CNN Turkey stated that there was a babe that was indicated by a power of 4.0 on the court scale.
On Wednesday, a earthquake of the force 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmary region - it was to see until Istanbul. In addition, its epi room was located westernly in Marmarameer, the catastrophed Afad already shared on Tuesday.
It wasn't the only earthquake that provided for shoes on this Tuesday: Pakistan also was found by a severe earthquake.
Researchers conclude that it could come to a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul earlier or later - the spending between the Tectonic plates is extremely high.
Agricultural scientist Ersoy considers that the earthquake is now a warning. It was more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "This could be the signs of a greater earthquake," so Ersoy to the sender. "First or later the big babe will also come."
Just a few weeks ago it had given an interaction - the babe solved great anxieties also in Istanbul. In Albania it had given a strong earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 vulnerable people. Even on the ground sea this year it had made the earth.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine Affairs
Two brisant documents provide for new combustion in Ukraine business for potential misuse of the US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible official depreciation procedure, the US democrats are strengthened: the complaint submitted by an anonymous referendum on Trump and its obscured phone with the Ucraine president is important for investigations against the presidents. Trump himself views himself more than a "Hexenjagd". He also doubted the worthy of the whistleblower.
USA: Airlines Flugast locked in Toilet - F′er surrounded
Since a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight was surrounded by United Airlines. The WC door was blocked during the 1554 flight from Washington to San Francisco, the airline shared US media.
In an exceptional interlanding at the middle of the weekend (local time) in Denver, the woman could be released from the close cabine.

The Kakerlake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan handle with the entire brexit-chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is inconsiderable.
Inspired by Franc Kafkas, a famous story "The Translation" wrote the British success of Ian McEwan (71) a book about the Brexit Chaos in Britain.
The Roman "The Kakerlake" (original: "The Cockroach") will appear to German on 27 November, divided by the Diogene Verlag (Zürich). It is about the conversion of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in previous life, but now on one occasion the strongest britain man is. He sees it as his mission to implement the people's will in reality and has been determined to stop nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "When the Parliament is closed, so that the government can not be asked at a critical moment when the Minister lyes without shame as one of the Soviet leaders when Brexiteers in high positions to address the catastrophe of a non-deals - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write.
Kafkas 1915 is the first published story of Gregor Samsa, who wakes up on the morning and looks "to an untemporary injury" after and after family and society is excluded. "Ian McEwan is declined from Kafka to describe a world that stands the head," he said from the Diogene Record.
The EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria’s train infrastructure
1⁄00 Wagons in Austria and Hungary get fluid brains to reduce the load of warming by trains. . Sections of train connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna Newstadt and Sopron are modernised and electricized.
This will make it more comfortable for the EU's visiting travels and reduce the CO2 outcome, which comes from the EU Infrastructure Centre "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: Rejected all travels until 31 October
The German traveller Thomas Cook, on one day after Innza request, rejected all travels until 31 October 2019. Travellers could "not be accessed for legal reasons", shared by the company on Thursday.
It also affects bookings of the Marks Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOURS, Booker Travels and Air Marin, which are already paid or paid completely. As it states for travel from 1 November 2019, the company opened. In accordance with the Insurance Insurance, the next procedure will be verified, said it.
Thomas Cook in Germany was advised in the Sog of the Britain Mother Concern and had submitted an advice on the middleweek. The company, including Neckermann Travels, eye Tours and Booker Travels, was employed in Germany about 2000 people.
Insurer wants to give hotels from now once again money
Nevertheless, from this Friday, hotels in the foreign country, who are currently in the hotel of Thomas-Cook authors, will receive money from the Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are based on the condition that the authors are no longer invited to extra calculations.
On the basis of booking information and without a proposal of separate accounts, the hotels will now receive 50% of the outstanding payments, as said a Zurich speaker of the German Presse Agency. "This applies immediately and under the condition that Thomas-Cook travelers from these hotels are not immediately invited to pay individual hotels or needed otherwise," continued Sprecher Bernd England.
The insurance responded to reports of hotel guests who were forced to pay their accommodations on their own place, so some had to place over 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Foreign Unit (DRV) and the Consumer Centres' Federation had criticized this.
As many hotels are affected, the vote will be voted on Friday with the insided travel provider, said the insurance speaker. After information from Thursday, there were 70,000 Thomas-Cook pauschale authors from Germany. The Zurich Germany has assured vacation and return to the Thomas-Cook currencies.
In the administrators, they want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook communities in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the currently announced payments to hotels by the Zurich insurance help only the travellers who are still on the road. For Thomas-Cook currencies who want to run in the holidays, it seems bad. At the latest Thursday, the company shared all travels until 31 October.
As it is about traveling from 1 November 2019, the company opened it. In accordance with the Insurance Insurance, the further procedure will be verified, said it. Basically, the insurance of Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travels is arrested. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich that can be represented by Kaera. Customers may inform on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and make their applications valid on a web form.
Prince Harry zers Sprengmine insole
Prince Harry has made the commitment of Lady Diana for a long time. In Africa he now walks directly on his mother's tracks.
The British Prince Harry was clothed with a blue split protection west, and he burned and burned a sprengmine.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he set the air circuit on Friday morning before running TV cameras. In safe distance, he exploded the spending body in the Savanean land, without damage. Although only Halo Trust has made more than 1000,000 residues of the bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 mine fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African travel, Harry then wanted to walk directly in the town of Huambo on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same spearmaker, who once accompanyed his mother, he wanted to leave the way she went on that time. The images on which Princess Diana went through a space mine field were walking around the world. She also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a daily African journey that has started in the South African tourist metropolis Capstad.
Remaining Brexit negotiations: No deals remain acute
In fact, Premier Boris Johnson was clearly determined: with him there will not be a guaranteed relief of the Brexit negotiations, but what statements have been made in the Polyrising British forever. The latest judgement of the High Court in Britain weeps as a damoclean burden over the blondshop. His suspension of Parliament to be able to carry out his brexit course until the date of exit was canceled. However, a law that was prohibited by the European Parliament is committed to enhance the bilateral negotiations with the EU until 31 October.
Boris Johnson still thinks the deal is possible
However, the pressure also seems to be unlike Johnson. In the midst of a hospital disorder, he made an extension of the negotiations in the case of a non-union until the end of October:
You, we will keep on the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And the best thing with a deal, I'm carefully optimistic that it's going to do.
And the time runs the Brexit negotiators in Brussels, and there are about six weeks that the EU and the British Underhandler have time to prevent the exemption of Britain from the European Union without agreements, but the latest talks have no longer reached a break. A agreement is now more difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not put the Law into force, the re-distribution of the date of exemption, but the opposition does not believe the words of the Prime Minister, and you are afraid that Johnson could, in the case of a non-deals, apply the Brexit.
US members: More deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of death cases related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. In addition, it was employed between 805 and probably damage in this context, the US health-related CDC shared. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, there was already over 900 persons concerned. The cause for long damage is still completely unexpected. In Europe there is no similar increase in long-term damage. The claims appear to be limited to users in the United States.
The most before new protests in Egypt w.
The videos of Mohammed Ali were shared in online networks. The builder and sight player who live in Spain calls for a "popular revolution". For today's Friday, he has been called to further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, where critical corruption and misunderstanding are forbidden. Ali hopes that a million participants are in the central places of the country.
In the centre of Kairos, there was already a strengthened police presence. Several U-Bahn stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir place were locked. In the past days, the police had strengthened their road controls, and the phones of footnotes were partly searched on messages and photos related to the protests.
On 20 September, the demonstrants also gathered around the Tahrir place.
Last week it came to Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to Protests with hundreds of participants. A such open protest has not been given in Egypt for years. In response, the security forces reacted to it. According to the Human Rights Organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) they have been arrested from almost 2000 people since last week.
The organization also criticized the Zensur in the North African country, and then the government blocked in Kairo Websites and Online Services to submit further protests against Al-Sisi. The General has been governing the country since 2013 after he had destroyed the Democratic Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of islamists, government adversaries, bloggers and activists have been arrested and condemned in part in the past years.
"Ocean Change": Herved Fuchs of Greenland-Expedition back
The Polarforscher Arved Fuchs was returned on Friday by his Greenland-Expedition. He was welcomed at his arrival in Hamburger ports, including by the Skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg with the "Malicia" Renning.
In the past months with a team of scientists, fuchs had examined and documented the effects of heating on Segelschiff "Dagmar Aaen" at the coasts of Islands and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future Movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He has long expected the young generation to speak. They know that the earth was heated for years. However, many acted as there was a planet B.
"What is on the sea, it is often under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of the heat and the confusion of the sea. In the expedition, inter alia, it was measured with a drewne Greenland Glatchery and was met with networks to microplastic, it said.
For his "battle for a sustainable and respectful use of the World Sea", the Polar Forscher from Bad Bramstedt was expelled in the Hamburger climate week with the "Seadevcon Maritime Award". "For us all who survive the Ocean in the heart, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the price delivery. "He is a witness of changes that have been made in the Arctic last years."
Teure Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for Nudels 430 euros
430 euros for two Spaghetti Tellers with fish in a simple aurant near Englandsburg in Rome: this seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The account of 80 euros was paid by the two women, but they posted the exiting on Facebook, which exhausted hit reactions.
"So many cases damage the view of Rome. We invite the police to follow the question of whether this is a disappointment," requested a speaker of Federagit, the band of travellers in Rome, according to the Roman journal Il Messaggero.
The reaction of the inhibitors of the restaurant came immediately. The Japanese women had not only ordered Spaghetti but also fresh fish, but the local owner was justified. However, this is not to be taken from the account. A drink money from up to 20% of the account was also normal, said the guest.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is crazy? The US President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with an official procedure that democracy wants to check this as quickly as possible with their investigation in the representative house - the talk is from week to week.
At the beginning of the scandal, the telephone with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The proposal of the whistleblower, who cared about the national security and the United States' democracy with its complaints, is a monstrous: the President has misuse the power of his office to instrumentalise the government of another country for an influence on the election of 2020. He has exploited the Ukrainian dependency and so wanted to force them to be active against a political enemy.
The core of this prehumanity is also to be completed in the interview of the talk with Selensky, although it doesn't renew the complete word. The phone of July 25, but it is only a episode of a much greater story in which the centre near Trump is especially his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes from the public in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giulianis travel plans reported to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiew with the same chosen president Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very exactly that his purposes are heavy. "We don't meet us in a choice to meet us in an investigation of what we have the right," he says the journal. You can think it is unusual, but "that is nothing illegal." Giuliani wants to follow investigations, for which there is no basis - "for these information will be very, very helpful for my clients and to be helpful for my government."
The lawyer and former New Yorker citizens seem to have been invaded with the right disturbance fantasies fixed on Trumps contra-candidatin at the election 2016: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at that time to build an opportunity for the Russian investigations in the United States. However, this proposal was never serious to take.
The version of Giulianis and the president speaks exactly about the Trump in July on the phone with Selenskyj. The former Vice-President and presently apparent applicants for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, have been the Ukrainian officer of the Government of Obama to the release of the Ukrainian general lawyer Viktor Schokin. In order to stop the guest undertaking, his son Hunter Biden was active in his supervisory council. By the senior, Ukraine has financed the corrupted powers of his family.
In fact, the end was something different. When Joe Biden requested the Ukrainian general lawyer to go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden had never been directly affected from it. Chokin was also advised to the deeply corrupt donors, the US government was not at Weitem the only western partner who forced it to leave. In addition, Obama government supported even the investigations against the company.
Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive sights in Instagram and Facebook. In particular, Germany, Great Britain and Spain are affected. on the website, all things.de reports to the user that Facebook has not been reloaded since approximately 15.30 hours. Instagram also shows that the error message could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the sighting, even if it is not yet.
Instagram and Co.
It is not the first massive cash case in this year. Just in March and July, the services were expired for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users take back this time, especially on Twitter to make their difficult air.
Poland's protectors in the Antarctica
Three Poland farmers have been saved from the Chile air weapons from the ice of the Antarctic. They were on the road with a screwboat and several miles away from their base when their engine denied. They had happiness in the disaster - less than one hour the Chilean salvation shooter needed for the building.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chile Air Brigade:
"On 9:30 we received the message to shortly before we were started, and 20 minutes we were guarded over the shooting ship."
Poland was held on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 students work there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Attention:Artphone NE kabellos Upload
Practice, but damage
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but it should not be used.
Since recently several new artphones have come on the market, which are undergoing cabellous uploads and are very well covered - all before the new iPhone-11-models, we want to call again a memory from beginning July. The cabellose loading of mobile devices is very practical, but not absolutely recommended.
Higher temperature sets the battery
Researchers warn against the cabellless loading of artphones. This is as the recognition of the University of Warwick is extremely damaged for the devices. The reason is that the clearly greater heat development is. If a phone is normal per cable, the battery is in three hours to 27 degrees. In the cabellless layout, the researchers are in the perfect alignment of the artphone on the ladepad. If the phone is a little closer to the speed, the temperature grows still. Moreover, the water strength of the ladepad is increased, which is more than 30 degrees of the power consumption.
Capacity and Life
According to researchers, the temperature for the sustainability of the batteries is a decisive degree. Every degree plays a role. When loading with temperatures, the battery is not only a capacity but also a long term. So the life duration falls less. The researcher advises to always load the artphone by cabell. Since a batteries in modern artphones is always connected to high costs, it must be a helpful tip. Apple has added to the costs of a battery, even again, and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient:Easy put the device on a suitable ladepad - these are already in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars installed - and the battery will be loaded without slight cable salat and swimming stecker fibres. Since Qi (inductive energy transfer) is implemented a global standard, which includes even Apple, there are no restrictions. However, the technology should only be used for researchers in the exception.
Everest-State Photograph: 13 thousand in six months
A Nepalese mountain stretcher has shown within only six months 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of the Manassue in Nepal and has set a record, shared his expedition agents.
The former soldier wants to reach all 14 thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international shield lines: from him is a photo of mountain growths that are on Mount Everest Slanges.
The picture of the mass advance solved a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 metres high mountain and the highest rubber of the earth. In May, 11 Kletters died within less days.
A problem for Purja could be the appointment of the 14th thousand: Currently Chinese authorities lock the X-bangma-berg in Tibet. As a reason it is called a bad weather among otherwise. In the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to enable him to rise.
Four dead elefants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a tremendous elefant cuh, a police speaker shared on Friday. "We believe that the elephants were devastated."
The four Kadavers were found in a protection area nearly the famous and many tourists visited by Sigiriya. The animals were urged by the police speaker from 15 to 25 years of age. A autopsy was assigned to determine the cause of death.
On Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elefants are killed every year. The farmers are often farmers in which the animals had been injured before. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elefants each year. This happens mostly when the animals take villages by their lives.
In Sri Lanka, there are only 7.000 elefants. Their murder is theoretically the death penalty.
Contained British oil tanker leaves the Iran
The British Oil Tanker "Stena Impero" leaves more than two months after Iran fixed the town of Bandar Abbas. This gave the bandary total Abbas according to the IRNA News Agency. The Iranian Revolution Gardens had fixed the tenker running under British flag on 19 July under the forehead of having disregarded the rules of sea right in Persian Golf.
Management of Thomas Cook in criticism
The competent Economic Committee of the Sub-Home wants to examine the place of the traveller Thomas Cook, which should also take place the content packages of the representative as regards the question why the British Government did not contribute financially to the overliving undertaking. "Our interest applies to the company's view as the control by external accounting investigators," shared the chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "We obviously have to do it with a worry example of managers."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of darm cancer
The role of the genes in the increased damn cancer risk has apparently been overestimated until now. This is the result of researchers of German Cancer Research (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a current area. Other risk factors such as nutritional habits of nutrition are likely to be considered more difficult than so far. This has the consequences for the consequences of the individual damn cancer risk, which show DKFZ sciences.
Elon Musk allows Tesla action to increase
This wrote Musk on Thursday (Location time) from Branchen blog "Electre" e-mail to Tesla collaborators. The request is strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, he continued to write in Musks.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the science and that Tesla must offer as many resources as possible to the quarter end.
Investors reported the information: Teslas shares went with a plus of more than six pro-pro-shops from the trade. The course has been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95'000 cars and so reached its best value.
Musk needed records to achieve his high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver 360'000 to 400'000 cars, which must have six numbers in the current and coming fourth year. In particular, the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here the winnings are low. Despite the tree, there was later loss.
Will the British Government handle Brexit-law?
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson thinks to be covered by whether he seeks the recent law imposed by Parliament against an unregulated degree, and on a question he only said before journalists on Friday, his government will keep its right.
The law provides that the Government needs to deal with a movement of the expiry term should not have reached agreements with the EU until mid October; Johnson criticizes this as a "capitalisation law", which is difficult for negotiations with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister John ́or expressed the conviction on Thursday, that Johnson could try to use "political shire" to carry out the law. Johnson could use a procedure that moves the entry into force of the law at the time after the EU entry.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we should leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Iran seems to be able to drive up uran
Iranian President Hassan Rohani, in the fight against the salvation of the historical Atomic Agreement, pressed the contractual partners. "Therefore, the states show incapacity or lack of preparation when it comes to specific actions," Rohani said on Thursday at a press conference at the border of the United Nations Full Assembly in New York. In the case that they do not stand to their promise, he took a further step from the agreements of 2015, which were dealt with.
The background is the conflict with the international agreement on preventing a Iranian atom bomb, which had the contradiction to normalize the economic relations. The United States increased in 2018 in Aleingang from the agreement to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to a change in the neighborhood policy aggressively recognised. The Government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with stronger orders and, inter alia, restores to hard sanctions against Teheran. Iran reacted further with a rehearsing of the uranary decreased in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Protector (IAEA) visited in a report that the Islamic Republic now uses or has at least prepared centerfuges installed on the beginning of September with Uran. The IAEA information also provides Iran for the building of more than 300 more center trifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not ready to take part of their deal and therefore leave the Iranians with the costs and the burden of pressing US sanctions alone, but there will be further discussions that hopefully provide a solution.
Rohani continues to combat Iran in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in the mid-September, the United States has changed: Germany, France and British followed the responsibility of Teheran on Monday of the United States. Originally, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran were in Jemen to the attack, but the United States had been evaluated as a misunderstanding. "We have nothing to do with this," confirmed Rohani at the middle of his position.
"Their accusations must be evident of this," said Rohani. "It would not have been possible for the leaders in the talks with him during the United Nations General Debat, but they would only have called on the fact that the rebels in Jemen could not take an attack like these. Rohani had met in the past days with the Federal Cancler Angela Merkel, President Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible conversations with President Trump, the US administration's large sanctions should be revoked, Rohani requested. He urged the Government in Washington to consider a "dialog and understanding".
Come of other stars crossed solar system
Astronomes currently watch a comet from the depths of the world Hall. This was first once. The comet allows rests on other solar systems.
The first thing was just a conscious: a intersterne guest crossed by our sun system. The comet from the depth of the worldra was baptized after Property discoverer to 2I/Borisov and has declined the interest of astronomes worldwide.
The largest comet was discovered on 30 August by the amateur astronomy Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatorium on the Crime - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres of diameters. Following observations of various observations, it was not only that it was an unknown comet but also showed that it was not from our sun system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstell object that was viewed at a flying of our sun system after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017.
2I/Borisov offers a rare opportunity to get out of the nearby visions in a foreign sun system before he disappears on nigger reviews. The first observations show that the intersterne comet is similar to our own system as the astrophysical Institute of Canadians. "The current speed of the comet is high, approximately 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is clearly above the typical speeds of objects that are about the sun's circuit," reported Davide Farnocchia from the US Room Room in a message.
The comet is based on the analysis on a so-called hyperbow trail that brings it out of our system - and clearly interestal origin, as told by the International Astronomic Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the design and category of the sky bodies. To honour its discovery, the interstlear swimsters, which were led in addition under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4 by her name 2I/Borisov, indicating that it is the second interstational object that was discovered in our sun system.
The astronomers have happiness: In contrast to 1I/'Oumaamua, 2I/Borisov has already been viewed in the attack, so the researchers remain many months for research. "The object will get the greatest light and then be seen with median telescopes until April 2020," said Farnocchia. "Therefore it will only be watched with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observations have already taken the viewer. Thus a team on Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which has already led the characterisation of 1I/'Oumumamua, in a first investigation of the mediator of the sky object from 2 to 16 km. The records of the Gemini-Observatories in Hawaii show a clear swimming of the comet.
Researchers and researchers of the Astrophysical Institute of Canadians (IAC) have already gained a so-called spectrum of the interstlear swimster that offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to the comets of our sun system, and it indicates that they must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation nearly states that comets in other sun systems could be shaped by similar processes as in our, supplemented by the Leon's college Javier Licandro.
The discovery of the same two interstlers within only two years, after estimating the IAU, indicates that these objects could open a new way to investigate certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often such steps are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstlers may possibly take a planned satellite mission of the space travel tagging Esa.
The Agency wants to stand up to 2028 at a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometers away from the earth, the three-party space zone "Comet Interceptor" (as comet-fishers). It should, according to Esa-Science Director Günther Hasinger or to a still unattracted, fresh comet from our own sun system, or to an interstellator such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Pekings new Mega Airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the Peoples Republic, it is so: On the new Mega Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, the first passenger machine of China United Airlines was landed, a special honor for Captain and Crew.
By 2022, approximately 45 million flightests will be transferred to the new airport annually, 2025 to be 72 million. China's President Xi Jin personally announced the exhibition of the 450 billion tyres project. The latest price project of China is also called "seaster" because of his six armed building structure.
The complex is over four start-and-land roads that will be extended later to seven and is equipped with the worldwide largest automatic flight management system. A new U-Bahn transports passengers in only 20 minutes to the inner town Pekings.
During the construction, the Chinese have many times believed that Berlin from Peking could learn. The exhibition of the building since 2006 - and essentially smaller - main city flights in Germany were still moved again. However, after four years, in Peking there was a first passenger machine.
New overscale aircraft will fly 2030: In four and half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four and half hours - from which the British UK Space Agency dreams. It is possible to make this, for the 2030s, a special flight in the overscale time (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, cited the Agency. "This is the technology that could finally work," said the Agency Graham Turnock to the sender. "We talk about the 2030s for the introduction, and the work has already been very progressed."
In order to advance the project, the British Room Traveling Journal would like to cooperate closely with the Australian Australien. A flight from the British capital to the Australian Metropole is currently about 20 hours. As the only superscale aircraft for passenger transport, the Concord was covered from 1976 to 2003 for its operation, and used for it three to half hours. In 2000, the United States Airport Lockheed Martin Plane developed an overshore flight on the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle at the start of the Paris Airport.

Upstairs in Washington: Trump wants anonymous tips in Ukraine business
In the Ukrainian business for potential misuse of the US president, Donald Trump wants to track possible and high places in the white house.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday before the United States newspaper workers in the United States in New York. The person concerned is almost "a spy" and with these you have been killed in the past "a little different" than today.
This was assessed as a temptation against Tipp providers. The event was not public, but several US media spread audio media on Friday. Democrates reacted to the President's statement.
The Democrats in the US representative house announced on Sunday preparations for an official procedure against Trump, and their proposals were particularly able to make the written complaints of an anonymous secret worker, who made serious accusations against Trump and its government center. On a large public pressure, the paintings of the indicator were published on Thursday.
In its work, the Whistleblower will receive information from several government workers, which the US President "uses the power of his office" to demonstrate that another country is mixed to its benefits in the US election 2020.
In the center of the foreground, there is a conflicting phone between Trump and the Ukrainian President Woodymyr Selenskyj, the end of July, in which the Trump encouraged his officers to investigate, which could damage political rivals Joe Biden. This is the former business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine, and the usual effort to shalt his prosssling before the Ukrainian Justice.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House with ack on the Ukraine phone: leaders of government workers would have tried to keep the exact opinion of the talk under the cover. As usually a electronic vocabulary protocol was provided. This would be, after the instruction of judges from the White House but had been removed from a normally intended database and was saved in a specially formatted system. This was published only a huge talk protocol.
The ability of the indicator is not public. The New York Times reported that it was to be an employer of the foreign secret service.
Trump repeated the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the President wrote, among other things, the "so-called Whistleblower" has spread information from the second hand that would have been inappropriate. Therefore, there may be no tips or spion.
As Trump said in New York about those who wanted to play information to the whistleblower, but he distracted emphasis. The president of the US representative house, Nancy Pelosi, reacted in disappointment and complaints, Trumps statement once again undergoing the integrity of the government.
In the representative house, many months in various committees have been conducted in various investigations against Trump and its environment.
"The Whistleblower has given us a plan for our investigation," said the Chairman of the Secret Service Committee in the Representative House, Adam ship. Trump attacked the ship, threw him a wrong representation of the things and asked him again to return to the president of the Committee. Trump switched the ship regularly and had requested his return for months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. Government workers from the security and external policy area, who were majority of democratic, but also of the Republican presidents, were in a statement published on Friday after the investigation of a possible official derogation procedure.
For the next process, there is no precise time schedule. With the majority of them in the representative house, the democracy could strive to a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on a real office has fallen in the seat, where the Trumps Republicans have the majority of them. The views on the success of such a procedure are low.
VW Operating Board: Workspaces are disbuilding "sleeping"
The VW Market's plans to continue to reduce the costs in the production could go to the loads of production in Germany and Europe. This concern triggers the autobuilder's operational council.
A key to this are the staff. The 2016 Company and Business Council negotiated "Finance Pacte" is already expected to reduce 14,000 workplaces only in Germany. Basically, a job can be destructed at the carrier only if it is almost demonstrated that the activities associated with it are no longer needed. In addition, an employment assurance is applicable until 2029.
As our magazine has now learned from operational council circuits, however, jobs in the production that are not available will be debugged in a different way - so at the official course, so free regular places would not often be re-employed.
In these cases, the Executive Board has no possibility to force rebuilding; in the meantime, there was a failure in many places of staff to take job deterioration, the concerns would be greater than a contemporary blowing of vehicles, and it would also increase the threat that the vehicle production could be exhausted after and after Germany and Europe because it was more favorable in other parts of the world.
The VW mark wants to standardize the production worldwide and control new projects, also to reduce costs and to accelerate decisions - the objective of strengthening the production and in order to enhance competitiveness. Andreas Tostmann's proposal said at a Berlin Manager conference: "Within insecure times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the United States and China, we are well advised to make us a crisis festival."
In this way, it is already successful: For example, in this year, the production of vehicles would first fall from 2013 in comparison to the previous year. Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, which was to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg to reduce 1,1 hours. Exact numbers of production duration does not call VW, according to our magazine information it is around at Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the staff work Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which the vehicles are produced. The works of Braunschweig and Salzgitter are made. For Wolfsburg inside, the VW is used to build 800,000 cars each year in order to be satisfied with the work. 2018 the excharge in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - conditioned by the decreasing demand and the problems in the conversion of the new consumption and gas testing procedures W.P.
As Tostmann has announced in the past year, however, in Wolfsburg, a million cars from the band should be rolled "perspectively". This will make it possible to join the golf production in staff work - because the work Zwickau through the conversion to the location of the e-auto-production results in golf.
In Wolfsburg, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (seat) are produced. However, the sales of Golf and Tiguan have developed addedly. Therefore, the expectations now rest on Golf 8. He will, despite all efforts to build the e-mobility first, remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburgers.

Young women from Nigeria have been charged with zears, clothed in the rush area and forced to prostitute, and six courageous human operators have to go into prison.
Six mute human traders from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday in Bochum to war and prison penalties from up to eight years and three months.

To force their obedience, the extracted Nigerian women had to leave a ritual swear at home before a Voodoo priest.

Ufo requests negotiations with Airhansa
FIm Permanently with the Airhansa Concern has threatened Ufo's flight membership with streeks again.
If the company does not return to the negotiations, the Association will "inform on 14 October on the work fighting action in the LH-concerns", the Ufo Tarif President Daniel Flohr on Friday. Airhansa and its daughter Eurowings have refused to take negotiations with Ufo Tarif, which is also the question of whether the AFO has legally cancelled tariff contracts in the airhansa.
At this point, Ufo is now strengthened by a decision of the Court of Justice of Frankfurt and Airhansa wanted to find that the tariff contracts were not cancelled, and the Court refused the requests, and the company endorsed the decision and tested to put the rights in place. "The second court sees the matter totally different, I think it is unlikely," said Ufo-President Flor.
In August, Airhansa had also submitted an application to the Court of Affairs Frankfurt to verify the status of Ufo as an actor, which argued that the asset has not been eligible for months and that it would not be able to carry out its role as tariff partners.
In the past, the Ufo had a already started vote on the strike of the cabinet staff at the end of July.

U.S. Warn Federal Government from Huawei
The leader of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too big," Pai said to the "handle sheet" with a corner on the building of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which commits each company to follow the instructions of the security bodies.
The legal law also prohibits the company to inform third parties of such questions, as the FCC head continues, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has, inter alia, agreed to request the suppliers a "confidential claim".
Berlin wants to try to control the risks, such as with technical solutions, reports the "handle sheet" by vocational information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology is not only out of the hardware:
The software is just important to keep the devices in the latest state. This software consists of billion lines of program code that change with time," said Pai.
It must be "very difficult to imagine" that a Governing staff, "where it would be able to check every individual update in real time to detect security risks", as the FCC head continues.
The Chinese Concern Huawei presents close contacts to the Chinese State Appartment:
The ownerships are untransparency, and the employee company, which appears to be part of the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai said to the "Action Sheet".
The United States provide knowledge of where government workers were located within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to replace the position of the United States.

Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson weight question on Brexit-tactic
The British Prime Minister Johnson criticizes the "Capitalisation Law".
The Parliament is back, a law proposes to the British Premier to avoid a chaos brexit, but critics claimed that Boris Johnson could use a snuffle, but to the possibility that the Tory Policy is weakening.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson thinks covered whether he wants to implement an unregulated breakdown, despite the latter law imposed by Parliament, which is to prevent exactly this.
The law provides that the Government must take a movement of the expiry period until mid October, no agreement with the EU should be reached; Johnson criticizes this as a "capitalisation legislation" which difficults negotiations with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister John ́or expressed the opinion on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political schêe" to deal with the law, and the Prime Minister could use a procedural strike that moves the entry into force of the law at the time of the EU's entry into force. Johnson said that he seeks a treaty with the European Union. "We are convinced to leave the EU on 31 October, and that is the best way with an agreement."
Johnson's Chief Counciler Dominic Cummings said that he felt the political debates about the brexit as "spacing in the park" and showed himself that the EU's efforts were still stated: "We will enjoy this, we will win, we will be out of the EU, don't worry," said the cummings of the British magazine "Telegraph".
Cummings, leading the Brexit "Vote Leave" campaign during the election fight before the EU Referencement 2016, now works as a leader strategy in the British Government Seat Downing Street. He wants to be behind the uncompromissible which led the Premier to a very unrefugiated situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood before the camera of Linda McCartney, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it must not always be the big glamour. The photobook "The Polaroid Diaries" (Taks) is deep inside the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married with her in 1998 from 1969 to Linda's death, was probably proud and touched when he presented the "The Polaroid Diaries" image band in the middle of September in Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrated guests belonged to Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and the president of Chrissie Hynde.
After the Launch Event McCartney at Instagram wrote: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a flighting cock in the life of a extraordinary family from time before Instagram, a celebration for the existence of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the sofort magic of the polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art stories at the University of Aına until she found the photograph, the camera was always there. Thousands of polaroids have made it, some hundreds of them will now be published first in the "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, silent lives, landscapes, several Hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "You wanted real moments," writes the artistic Ekov Eshun in 日. Of course, there is still one in the middle of your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him.
So Mary McCartney said that she would have slept as a baby in a bed that her father had been based on an old cartoff. And it was not always clean at the McCartneys.
Like nearly another media, the Poloraid camera starts the immediate moment. The records of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family journal, but they are much more than clean shots.
It's about the decided click: you need to recognize if you have a great photo before you. And then you have to cut it in the right moment, said Paul McCartney. "If you're knipping two seconds later or two seconds ago, it could be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had had to have had to have the gift always taken the right moment. "You knew just that she had it," said Paul in the Eshun-Essay.
There is the light, the composition, the image extract and the colors, which "The Polaroid Diaries" does not only make a sustainable picture book for Beatles-Fans, but more than all anecdotics is also a great esthetical pleasure where lands have been acting as abstract paintings. The perfect completion of the Beatles album "Abbey Road", which has occurred exactly 50 years ago.
"We'll purchase oil and gas from Iran"
The Turkish president Recept Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not interrupt the import of oil and gas from Iran.
We'll purchase our earth gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had participated in the United Nations full assembly.
However, Erdogan said that Turkey had problems in importing Iranian Earth Oil, since some companies would have "returned" because of U.S.D.
However, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran in this and in many other matters," said the Turkish President who repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States have followed a "maximum pressure" of the Islamic Republic since they have come out of the international Atomic Agreement with the Iran. According to the United States, the Iran has followed in secret a atomic programme and does not follow the agreement.
In the past months, the expenses in the Golf region have been significantly increased.
US Government wants to bear refugees
The US Government wants to take refugees drasticly. The United States Foreign Minister explained on Thursday that the annual border of a renewation programme should be decreased from now 300,000 to 18,000 refugees. This corresponds to a 40% incidence.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained that the United States would continue to look forward to the support of refugees, but the most important task is to sing and serve US citizens, which is currently overloaded by the US immigration system.
The Government of the United States will futurely be able to take into account two refuge groups: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Irakers who have helped the US military in the country and have been advised in this way as shown by the Declaration of the External Ministry. On the contrary, from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, the maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from United Nations stores worldwide are selected and re-distributed to the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the budget year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. The current top limit of 30,000 is a deepest value. When the US president Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House left, the number was at approximately 85,000.
Assistance organizations reacted ashamed of the announced decrease of the top border. "This is a very trivial day for America," said the Chief of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, and the United States would continue to harm their leading role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump trys to limit the immigration into the United States - legally as illegal - strict. The US government expects its own information for the next budget year 350,000 asylum requests. These figures are depreciated by the New Assessment Programme.
Donald Trump - "Come near a mirror"
The US President Donald Trump has considered an indicator in the Whistleblower business of the Spionage. Anyone who has given appropriate indications to the informant who predicts power misuse, "coming close to a spitsel", said Trump, according to a registration of a private event on Thursday in New York.

It was also a trial to prevent a congress investigation of a possible official derogation procedure against him, wrote the presidents of the Committee on External, Secret Services and Survey in the Representative House.
The Whistleblower proposes to the president in a currently published complaint that he had misuse his office to request a mixture of another country in the US election 2020. It is particularly about his interrupted phone with Ukrainian officials Woodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the speech, Trump put him near to investigation against his possible democratic demander Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump strives against every misbehavior.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower is himself and its informants. As the New York Times reports, however, it should be an analyz of the foreign secret service.

Only WeWorks new contracts ensured that the request for offices in New York was greater than the new areas on the market at this time. Without WeWorks Expansion, the Office training in the US Metropole would take place at this time, as Alpert wrote in "Business Insideder". Similarly, WeWork looks out in London, where WeWork was in the midst of several duzens of offices in the best position.
In addition, in the British capital, the balance on the real estate could be seen without further expansion of the aggressive startup.

In order to make his business model soon profitable, the owners of the real estate of the expected million income. Access to the - without-button - reserves of WeWork have not been acquired despite the long-term contracts. Because the advice of each place of WeWork is generally made by any extra-based daughters, such as special Purpose Vehicles, for which the mother society only holds in a limited limit.

New climate Protest of Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people want to go back to the street for more climate protection.
In order to end a international climate week, the motion Fridays for Future rebuild action and Kun's activities in thousands of countries worldwide. The beginning should be made because of the time testing New Zealand and before the protests move over Europe to North America. There the climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major service in the Canadian Montreal. Before the White House in Washington, they wanted to gather demonstrants.
How big the worldwide access to this Friday after the story of the previous week is, it is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "The last Friday over four million people have made for the climate. This Friday we're doing it again!" she wrote on Twitter. Too long it has been given action in 170 countries in the streek week.
The last Friday was very large. A third of all worldwide demonstrants - approximately 1.4 million - have been shared in the protests in 575 German cities. This time are a list of movements planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munch and Köln, but also in smaller communities and cities such as young people in Northern Rhein Westfels or Westerland on Sylt want people to go to the street for climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg was set before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to invite the more of its country to increase the use of climate protection, which has occurred in a short time the Fridays for Future movement. The climate proteins participate in primarily the students and the students, but also in the lasting measure of professionals and other growths.
Commonly, they call for more honour in the fight against landing and threatening climate disasters, especially in accordance with the Paris climate agreement, global heating should be under 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial time.
Thunberg came nearly a month after a two-week transatlantic tunnel with a high-sea round in New York, where she had recently shared in climate protests and bribes of the United States. On Monday, she held a emotional talk in the United Nations, in which she spoke to the State and Government head of the Earth. In her home Stockholm, she was accompanied for more climate protection of the alternative Nobel price of the right lifehood.

Switch against Cyber Crimeal - Disabled servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators first have removed a large server provider for illegal business in Darknet.
In total, 13 acts are in the contempt that, as operators of a county in an ancient Nato-Bunker in Traben-Trabbach at the Mosel, many websites have been hosted over the international acting criminals.
This shared the General State Advocate in Coblenz. Seven facts were arrested on Thursday in a large action. The Darknet is a defensed part of the Internet.
The customers of the facts were to be the operators of the worldwide biggest Darknet market place for "Wall Street Market" - who had destroyed investigators in the early year. In addition, the attack on 1.25 million Telekom-Ro end November 2016 was charged by the General State Advocate over a server in Cyberbanker.
A such host was first extracted in Germany, called it. A webhost provides the infrastructure for a Internet presence.
The access action with the support of special units such as GSG9 has conducted research in Germany and neighborland, which have been resulted in almost five years of investigation. On midnight, the investigators want to inform more details.
New worldwide climate Protest of Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people want to go back to the streets for more climate protection.
To end a international climate week, the motion of Fridays for Future revives action and customs in thousands of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, München and Köln, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Yuchen in Northern Rhein-Westfalen or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate Protest ○ Who are Thunberg's backmans?
Justice and courage are high tugends, including in the 21th century, in a world full of wars and smoke factors that hit the climate. More surprisingly, a 16-year-old girl calculates the powers of the people of this time. But what is behind it? Is it a helpful preparation or a smart conversion of a climate activist? History master performance or manipulating tactics about her own?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg moves the mass and brings young people up to a better climate friendly world. It is not historically seen that a young man creates a collection of children and youths for himself. In 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Köln has chosen to use himself for a righteous world. At that time, he has also gained a multitude of young people and has formed them to overcome the sea to get into the promised country, as Greta Thunberg recently made on the journey to America with a segelboat.
But there is a shadow page about this? Why does it take a action called "We don't have time" to save the world? Moreover, Greta Thunberg has rich PR-Manager at its side. All around her mother has published a book that has been largely deployed, thanks to the daughter in the light of the ramp. Even old-leavened followers of Greta Thunberg were a little disappointed over the last PR-show, or the travel with the boat was probably also set too dick. This is also not unbased, because the action came very well to the media worldwide, and it fled much money thanks to the imposing actions.
Now the spirits are separated: Is it morally proper to be able to acquire financially in the world's court? Is it still authentic if some persons work together during the world salvation action? All the same position is to be regarded, that a critical and reflective view is still more important in a democracy-related society, since the Democracy is aware of various opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can also make it clear to some trends.
Comet discovered: Interstler guest crossed by our sun system
A foreign comet is currently crossed by our sun system.
The confusions of the astronomes have been active: a foreign comet is currently crossed through our sun system - he is only the second of his kind.
Garching/Washington - long researchers have just thought it, but now they have confidence: a comet of another star crossed our sun system at the moment. He was baptismed after discovering 2I/Borisov, and is just busy at astronomes worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomes on the crime
It was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Crime. He looked with a self-built telescope to heaven and other post-observations instructed his first deceit. It is actually an unknown comet that is not from our sun system. He is only the second of his type that was viewed at the flying.
The great opportunity for astronomes is now to get out of the nearest view of a foreign sun system. The comet is apparently similar to those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical Institute of Canadians. The comet is, according to the International Astronomic Union (IAC), clearly interestal origin and is currently moved to a so-called hyperbow that brings it out of our system.
Comet has been seen before an attack - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, the astronomes can see it in the middle of December. In contrast to the preachers, 2I/Borisov has already been viewed in an attachment, which means that he can be investigated for many months from the earth. "The object will get the greatest light and then be seen with median telescopes until April 2020," said Davide Farnocchia, the U.S. Roomfactor, "Therefore, it will only be watched with greater, professional telescopes until October 2020."
The leader of the new cuker: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumamua".
First knowledge about Comet 2I/Borisov Wake up hopes in the Community
According to the first recognition, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers of diameters. At the same time, the sky body appears to be similar to our comets - because as the IAC researcher Julia de León expressed it, the spectrum of the Sweetster is similar to us. This observation is close to that comets in other solar systems could be formed by similar processes as ours, supplemented by de León's college Javier Licandro.
However, the observation is outside specific recognition, and that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years, allows in circumstances a new way to investigate certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids always worked again with the researchers. Soon a riesen asteroid passed over the earth and came near to her annually.
"Absolutely rejectable": Rachel Johnson's disappointment for brother
For Boris Johnson it becomes a single one. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister gets the military language of the Premier as "free". It is not the brother whom she knows.
"Capitalisation", "Betrug", Tract: Prime Minister Boris Johnson is still under pressure and continues - at least verbal. At the question time in this middle-week, it was on massive confusion of the opposition, and in the meantime, more critics have been reported: Duzende Bischöfe and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The journalist and author said to the sender Sky News, her brother used words such as capitalisation, as if the enemies of a EU issue should be "depended, long-term, divorced and edified". She thought it was overwhelmed. She did not recognize her brother's version again, Rachel Johnsons, who was accompanied by the EU parliament for the Anti-Brexit-Partei "Change UK".
She was aware that her brother Jo Cox, a EU-friendly subhuman deputy, who had been killed by a neonazi by a few days before the outcome referendum 2016. Their seconds could be best honored by translating the brexit, Boris Johnson said in the subhouse. "It's very unfortunate to treat a deputy who was killed by someone who called the "Britain first", now criticised John's sister. The father was obviously coming from the right-extreme camp that strengthened "by this kind of language". For all those who were treated, it's very fun.
In addition, the widow of Cox criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jos Name is so useful," he twittered. The best way to honor them is if you were suffering and deceived for what you believe - whatever you think is. But never you should "demonise the other side". He also complained that a atmosphere had occurred in the attacks likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had put his office as State Secretary and his mandate as Tory Deputy. "I was breaking between family loyalty and national interest - it's an unresolvable spending," Jo Johnson founded the step.
Johnson's language was also in the Church on scarce criticism. As the "times" reported, all 118 bishops and arzbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "the country is not worthy". In a common statement, they explained: "In the past days, the language is not acceptable, both in debates and outside Parliament. We should speak with respect."

A shower and youtuber makes Egypt's ruler: first Mohamed Ali remains in the foreign.
The two men who have influenced whether to reflower blood on the streets of Egypt have spent the last week in the foreign. One of the two switched on Friday to the Airport of Kairo. State President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the United Nations General assembly. The former General, the Muslim Brother Mohammed Mursi, the first chosen State head of the country, had stopped a pleasant time in New York: the President Donald Trump had committed Sisi's action against the political Islam and no silver against the human rights in the Nile - in a week, in Egypt's security force, hundreds of people have been arrested because they wanted to protest against the presidents. He had "needs to care for the Iraqians", he said.
In the mistake, the President of another man, who now determined the event on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained in the foreign, where he refused to access the security forces that would arrest him immediately when he tried to come to Egyptian land. A week ago, the 45-year-old age was only a minority of the Egyptians. Today he is the tonnageable voice that controls the political talk in the Cafés, the residence rooms and the teasts of the country: With Youtube-Canal "Mohamed's secrets" Ali calls his countrymen to rise against Sisi.
He goes directly and in a rustic language. As the people is hungry, the president in Luxus and lets build beautiful new palaces, it calls it. The military leadership on which Sisi is dominating, presents Ali corruption and areaization. Because he has made a builder for 15 years with exactly these gentlemen's businesses, he seems to know exactly what he is talking about - that is at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the current click numbers to explode.
The last week after Sisis Griff after the power of thousands against his rulership, and nearly 2000 citizens, among whom prominent figures of the civil society, human rights and opposition policies, were arrested, Ali called for this Friday to a "million march". That really so many people would walk on the streets, it was unlikely. However, there were to be smaller protests, such as Giseh at Kairo and in the place of China at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, their shareholders Al-Sisi corruption and requested his outcome. In these protests, the police also placed trees and guummichoses. These videos were also not independent.
From the town of Mansura in Nildelta, where demonstrants rided with the president's portrait in parts, the massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces created checkpoints in the city and on the output streets. In Kairo several U-Bahnsts were closed in the town for "Reserving work", most of the streets around the Tahrir place, the heart of the revolution of 2011, blocked. And on the Rabaa site, where the attachers of the corrupted muslimbrother Mursi were locked up until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, should prevent a different measure of unconfortable collection: Sisis's future party wanted to calculate a great time for the presidents.
Mohamed Ali made these proposals for a change in his tactic: "Our goal must not be the tohrir place," Ali said in Barcelona in his videocamera. "Let us not join the police officers." But as backwards, it is not to understand: "Ganz Egypt is the tohrir place."
If the Provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection seems to be much slower than the provider, there are different test options.
Those who conclude a Internet contract do not need to trust the speed information of the provider; customers can check how much of this is actually achieved in cases of accidents.
The previous transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore be achieved, explains the consumer central Bayers.
If the connection appears to be much slower than the provider, there are various test options. Thus, the measures of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them to the rate agreed in the Treaty.
"The tests of the suppliers are, however, carried out in accordance with specific requirements provided by the provider and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," gives the consumer central Bayers to think on their side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set a suitable period of 14 days in order to make the promised service available to the provider. This is the best way for those concerned in writing.
If this does not do anything at multiple requests, customers can announce and, in circumstances, request a damage rate. However, if they remain successful, they can only help the road of complaint.

Do日: Show more Russian Manipulation
The material from the Moscow analysis lab is manipulated - this is David Howman, the only director of the World Antido Agency (Wada) and today's integrity head of the light athletic band.
In order to reach the Lightathletic-WM new details come to the Do-Scandal in Russia to appear - and they destroy the little credibility that the Russian sports had started at the beginning of the year and had only been adequately returned. In January 2019, the Moscow Do-Labor finally delivered the requested samples from the year 2012 to 2015 to the World Antido-Agency (Wada). Now it appeared that they were old.
In December 2014, a systematic disturbance in the Russian sport enth. Once the Wada had been locked the Russian Antido-Agency (Rusada) for three years. At the same time, Russian sporters were not completely exhausted from the world's station. The International Olympical Committee reads after individual examination at the summer games 2016 in Rio around 270 Athletes of the country under neutral flag, at the winter games in February 2018 were 168 Russian sporters and sporters at the beginning.

The President of the independent integrity committee (AIU) of the Lightathletic World Conference (IAAF) has now assessed that the Do° data were manipulated from the Moscow analysis lab. "Yes. We have received the data for nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the right data," David Howman said at the interview of the "Frankfurt General Journal" on Friday. "We have found numerous discrepances between the data that the Wada from a whistleblower and those who received them from the Russians in January."
WM not affected
This affects the attitude of the IAAF: The light athletic band holds as the only organization at the Bann Russian. At the WM in Doha, 30 Russian sporters were running under neutral flag. They had to prove that they trained and tested outside the Russian system.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada Manipul had already placed in the room and invited Russia to answer the projects within three weeks. Russia now threatenes the renewed lock of Russia and in the worst case also the exclusion of the Olympics games in Tokyo.
