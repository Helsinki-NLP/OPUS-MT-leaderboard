Triumph of the legalists in Austria, at the total of 29 Pro
A significant deficiency of both parties of the large coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-eisyst parties resulted in the first provisional results of Parliament's elections from Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian Peoplesparty (ÖVP), where the position of the former President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the kip.
In contrast, the leader of the covenant for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Nuclear Landshotmann Jörg Haider, for a triumphale back to the Federal Policy.
According to the previous results, the social democracy (SPÖ) remains in the country with 29.8% of the votes, but the last elections in 2006 loses 5.5% of the votes.
It is still worse that the EPP loses nearly nine pro of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two large parties in the Austrian post-Werk History, and especially in the peoples party who had requested the previous elections, this is a really disastrous result.
On the beginning of July, when the EPP was exited from the coalition, the Parties had a clear prospect before the SPÖ.
The electors, however, have probably punished the party for the fact that they have allowed the Government to distort.
In the first reactions to the results, there was a specule about the possible reception of the president of the Parties and before the vice-cancer Wilhelm Molterer.
Observators believe that this may be at a exceptional meeting of the Parties' representation already on Monday.
Such development would probably remove the way to the most probably out of the election deck, so to renew the large coalition from SPÖ and EPP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-eised parties - the Freedoms (FPÖ) were temporarily receiving 18 prosies, the BZÖ eleven pro­ votes - but the social democrats gave their threat to repeat in 1999 when the People's Party with the People's People's Affections (hither the FPÖ was still united, it was departed from the BZÖ in 2005) in relation to a common government, which had even been sent to sanctions from the European Union.
It is obvious that Jörg Haider, who already stated that he was ready to cooperate with each party and goes from a return to Vienna to the Austrian Federal Policy.
In this Parliament, the party of Green, however, has easily lost and has been dismissed among the Austrian political parties from the fifth place.
There is no other party who has probably entered the four-percent quarters and therefore has not entered Parliament.
Blackzenberg: Relations with India can be cold
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech communists who have been accused of the immoral collection of buyers in India, it could, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, be given a certain refreshment of the Czech-Indian relations.
This stressed the Minister in New York after the present meeting with the Indian official colleagues Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this doesn't be clothed, then it's safe, then it comes to a certain refrigeration," he explained after a meeting that was found at a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the discussions, in judicial matters the executives can only be difficult to intervene.
Nevertheless, he stressed that in the case of Petr Svácha, who was released by the accusation and received a money penalty, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling wanted the matter.
"He's a problem could be dealt with," said the Minister.
For Emil Kuchera, who was sentenced to freedom in three years, it would be the best to be in vocation, according to Mukherdshi's view.
He could so ask for freedom of charge and wait for his judgment in freedom, as the Minister.
Schwarzenberg assured that his partner had expressed himself in negotiations as well.
"He recommends a vocation at a court, then a favor for him in question," said Chef of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way that the Czech side can be involved in the whole of the matter is to let the convicted "competent legal support" indicate the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such a help is already offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in getting close contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also give it to," the Swarzenberg reported.
At the same time, the Czech Press Agency ČTK confirmed, before partners, the Czech Republic meets the problem of the Czech Entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and complain these Czech communities," he explained.
An answer to the question whether he has received the claim from the Indian side to discuss the matter that the Minister has expressed.
"I have already been very promised," he only observed.
A Czech triggers the ring around the sea
It approaches a electronic card, on which are drawn and the border sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point, lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to the island and with her the border sea.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says the Italian jury Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirteen-commerce of the United Nations Division for Oceans and Sea.
His head, the Division Director, the Czech Jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it.
Here are workelans and entertainment.
The sea’s ground is still a little low world, which is rich in natural sources.
Here is oil to be found, in addition to heat and other non-creasing materials, but also living organs, which are still not known, for example, the key to develop a medicine against cancer.
A seaside, greater than the Festival country
The landscape states today have deeply reported their approach to the new sea areas.
According to a United Nations Convention, they make their rights to which they agreed in Montego Bay in Jamaica in 1982.
It is particularly the area of the continental scale that is mentioned, which often reaches up to a few hundred miles far from the edge of a country to the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exceptional attack on all sources of the continental schelf.
"Simplifiedly as a continental scale is considered the part of the seaground and its soils, which represents a natural continuation of the continent under the surface of the sea.
He exceeds the borders of the upper sea, often the limits of two hundred seas of the east economic area," says Mikulka.
The request submitted by the Commission’s country concerned to establish the external limits of the continental scale must be submitted by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation, which is responsible for many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to give the Commission legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five requests, even from Russia, Brazil, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now, only the three years of success called countries have been added to Miculka.
A international echo was recently able to increase its areas as the first country.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the sealand which was approved by the Commission last week is about 1,6 million square kilometers, so about six times more than the size of the State.
Both countries have invested millions of people in the investigations.
The winning that brings them out of the use of the sea ground in the future will, as they promise, have an unapproval value.
In addition, other States will gradually submit their requests.
You can do this for years since they have the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental scale ends, the territory of the ocean ground begins by the Convention as a "common inheritance of mankind".
There's no more a special position in this country.
The right to promote in this area grants an international institution established by the Convention.
"The ground of the sea is not a golden graverland," says with some transfusion, Director Mikulka and f', whose "see areas are legally defined and contractually enhanced."
Czech in Pacific
A part of the sea floor belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former East Block in the framework of the Common Interocean Metal Organization.
This was obtained in 1991 because of the Convention, as the investors of fewer other countries, the status of a so-called investor.
The organization has the right to promote in the Zone ́rionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something greater than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a species of Tatra on the ground of the sea.
"Forwards can be on a surface of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich foundation of polymetall constructions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan," such as another jurist, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian worker of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a confidence as a pattern.
It refers to a small cartoffle or, with some fantasy, to the famous scheme that has raised the legend after the Golem to life.
Dutch special powers were for freedom of ice from the place
The Egyptian Government had requested help from Germany to solve the ice crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
In the circumstances of the release, eleven tourists in Egypt will always be more details.
Indirectly, the German special advice was granted to the salvation action, according to the defence and internal ministerial information.
In this context, both specialists of the Federal War and officers of the GSG 9 were officials of the Federal Police, of the Federal Crime Lamp, as well as of the logistics of the technical assistance work at the place of freedom.
As the Ministers continued to communicate on Montagued, however, the German powers were not required because the captives left their prisoners and fled when they recognized signs for a violent release.
The Egyptian Government adopted the aid offered by Germany to join them as support forces in place.
"Happy not, it hasn't come to this," said a speaker of the Federal Ministry.
The trip group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian, and their eight Egyptian companions took place on 19 September in the south of Egypt.
After the destruction into a desert area in the south of Egypt, the islands in the border region between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Tshad were dropped and dropped.
The efficiency of the carrier remained unexpected as well as the details of the release or possible redemptions.
The saved ones have come to Kairo in the middle of the world.
Steinmeier said that the free islands are located in the obhut of the German message.
For details of the release, he did not express himself.
In Berlin there was no information to return to Germany.
According to the "image" quotation, the five holidays and the special officers will be exploded with a airbus of aircraft and will be met in Germany on Saturday.
US Representative House denied salvation package
The first room of the U.S. Congress has made the 700 billion billion too severe salvation package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones shot into the deep.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US representative house rejected the Government's salvation package for the financial markets.
Despite all the calls of President George W. Bush and the leaders of both parties, there was no majority of the programme in which the chaos should be attached to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the staff were trying to do more difficult to convince the critics still of the 700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiations leader, had called the Members to agree, even if the plan was inappropriate.
"It is hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he agreed.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones is still about more than six Pro° or about 600 points.
The reason was the concerns of the investors that the State salvation package could deteriorate.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, so that, after the announcement of the ship, he was re-born.
Experts now consider more serious turbulences on the international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the programme, it is necessary to accept both the House of Deputy and the Senate.
Increasing booking numbers of operators
It seems to be a good winter for the German travelers:
In travel bookings for the next months, the turnover is clearly shown in comparison to the previous year - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak conjuncture perspectives, the loss of travellers of Germans remains untrue.
In the bookings for the winter season, the travel offices had a 31 pro-play to the previous year, as reported by the German Travel Verband (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
The GfK Market Research Institute's investigation also provides booking numbers already provided for for the most months.
Thus, the turnplus of travel offices for October around 11 Pro in comparison to 2007, shared the DRV.
The basis for these results is the numbers of the GfK, evaluated monthly booking data of 1200 German travel offices and calculated for the total calculation.
The travel bookings performed until the end of August 2008 were noted.
The DRV shared in particular traveling to the United States because of the weak rate.
Here the booking growth is about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the homes of the Germans, are particularly asked for traveling targets.
In relation to paused travels, the DRV president Klaus Laepple stated highly.
In view of increased energy and food costs, the costs are "better calculatable for customers than for individually organised holidays".
In addition, consumers could save money through all-inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
Even the summer months have been very well dealed, so that it will be a turnover plan for the previous year, though, according to another way, the number of Germans who traveled in comparison to the previous year was decreased.
My first festival of October
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless spring, beer from liter-screen and Promis in Designer-Dirndln.
A show-shot.
Susanne Kron Zucker and I don't have much together.
She's a blonde, television moderate, and wears a mixed dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm student, and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: Three minutes on the wheat, the photographs are already crashed on us and the memory cards are fully - very funny and it is at my first show visit.
That's how you get friends.
The Billig Dirndl seems to fulfil his purpose.
As Wesn-Touri and north of the White-Worst Quator seated, the feeling of well-being remained in the trace until the date.
But only once once on the terrace, everything is so bad.
Almost everyone brings Dirndl or Lederhosn; no one looks distracted or painful - everything is completely normal.
It's rare that the chocolate's state is just my girlfriends.
A monastery makes me note that I would have wrongly bound the shoes: "Links highest free, middle girl, forgive right, reveal behind."
Headingly, I'll swim my shirts from behind to left.
"Pass," he said and laughed.
Others make less effort to subtile flirt technology and → slipped pellets on which "To drank to get dressed!" says and stretching the naked back to an unclean.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes named Bob, comes from England and visits the October for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long "ooooo".
He tells me that after he has determined his earlier drinking measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks he's a M'emer.
So Bob is one of the "Wildbeslers".
Others don't have the happiness to release the alcohol in this way.
For eight hours a night, healthy people run over the festival that must take care of the poor shooters.
The nurse managers always come up in the road - always four once drag a overcast tragedy of the table to the table.
This works as with the most Wesn visitors: empty, completely back.
Who's in the Promille cargo under the plan, you don't see.
"These are those who are packing more goarnime," one of the healthers called me on a question and disappeared in the tumor.
Name of the accident victim given by the police
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital after it was driven in Essex by a vehicle was given.
Carole Paulson, resident in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was shared in the accident on Friday evening on the Shenfield Road in the middle of the city.
She was brought to Queen's hospital to Romeford, but she died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the deceit on a light carrier.
Meanwhile, he was released to cution.
Turkey extended the diplomatic Horizon
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, the powers were interested in deep incoming in Turkey's backland.
On the spectacular side of the Bospore, perhaps just once 20 steps in Asia, is one of the most fairst relics of this failing, emperoral effort.
The Hydarpasha Bahnhof was made by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the travelers tell you.
The building sits rittlings at the end of the train street with a tour at each corner of the front side and looks like some provincial German Rathaus.
The stone is crazy.
The entire building falls around
But if you're inside the popular cart key, there's no doubt of the exhaustity of the prehumanity whose western access was this.
The bathroom was opened by a German consortium in August 1908, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, who was late in the imperialist game, had to implement before his ambitions, to dominate the Middle East, through a train connection, Bagdad, and further after what Saudi Arabia is today.
However, Germany's emperialist prosecutions claimed during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, produced by the unwindable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British powers dropped out of Egypt and forced the Turks and their German associates from Palestine and
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha Bahnhof.
In 1917, a munition train flew into the air, and the artificial dach was thrown down.
Turkish sources say it was Sabotage.
Since then, it has fallen slowly, softly passed through the history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as anatolian port and all of it, in order to enlarge the diplomatic Horizon of the Tukei.
The Governing Party of Justice and Development, the ACP, has introduced a voluntary new external policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, produced by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a neighborhood.
Remarkablely, the Turkish Government has relations with Israel and to the Palestinian split groups Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and, of course, to the European Union and the United States.
In order to evaluate the equations of this new external policy, I have demonstrated the nightmare in the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading external experts of the ACP, the Turkish Deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, approximately half hours later, after a holiday journey on glasses that produced the same step of the old world in the documentation "The Night Mail", I came into the Turkish capital, which was considered as a new city, for the new world's government, the Osmanian past.
However, the ACP, which is for its islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in the Turkish unit.
This has solved some of the misunderstandings in the west, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the ACP's main business, a specially manufactured, ultramoderous steel and steel construction, in a developing preference, around half-complete purchases and kids in which the medium manager in connections, both men and women, met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a medium-right politician of almost every other European political party.
I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's external policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cald War was an exception," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from her backland.
Today, she has to look at East and West at the same time.
It doesn't exist either one or the other.
You have to do both of them.
"But certainly Turkish could ever be," I asked, "will be forced to decide?"
"The Turkish," he said, "It wasn't gonna have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone with whom I spoke here, almost routinely said: The relations of Turkey, not only towards the Middle East, but also toward the Kaukasus and around the South Sea, are similar to the benefits of Europe and the United States, as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems to be the message, Europe can, in the overall sense, move towards equivalent railways in Asia and the Middle East.
Return to the Hydarpashas Bahnhof, after another broadless night, I thought on these two German governments, Mr. Ritter and Mr Conu, who had looked at the building of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East now, to many parts, could be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting for the roads that should bring me back over the Bospore, I recalled that Turkey was always called the cra's man of Europe in those days.
At least at that time, there were no doubts about which continent should have an appellation to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Dead" handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmoniker and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choor, Proteus, in the next year.
He was thinking about youths to 21 years, but when the Chor last time in 1979, some of us had been singing before the end of 20 - we refused to leave the Chor.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological exchanger) was for the preparation and ability of the Chores, any musical piece presented to him, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messias, whether a capella or with full orchester.
The musical sideship of such a young chores often was surprising, always exciting and was unique and only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his appreciation for the music that has never been after years.
How often we were dead to "look the music for ourselves".
He wanted to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His type of direction was absolutely clear and precise, but never overwhelmed.
Though the musical level was high, he always requested a more higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any director had to be killed to the rider, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two years, from 1962 to 1982, where he led the Guildford Philharmoniker.
In the last 40 years, I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by one - often I was inspired by them.
Dead Handley was that rare combination of size and personal humility.
He accepted the directors who, according to his words, simply "come home with one or two of them in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (25 September) you write that "he resumed the education of the economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research pension ... while he studied at the same time for a BSc, a MA and a doctor.
This is a conclusion from a author's comment in Woodruff's book "Jensity of Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953, he was a doctor of the economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral work on the British Kautschuk industry under the maintenance of Professor J.D. Chambers, which later was published as "The British Kautschuk industry" in 1958.
He was 1950-1951 in the United States at the train of a Houblon-Norman Stipendie, and delivered the summer of 1952 to the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left nottingham finally and went to Illinois.
It's not, why Woodruff wanted to interfere with this part of his runway.
J. Vicente Resino in the philological faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black-white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me carefully on her because of their lightness and the power they broke out, as they always handle with respect with the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magical moments."
Second of the excellent sale in Honda.
In November, Honda began with the confusion of the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Since his precedent model had a large internal room, this large space limousine offers a significantly greater.
It also comes to the technical properties that enable even more comfortable drives and gases.
Amendments before the future revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz shows a similar line to advances, the changes made in this large limusin are numerous.
In addition, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics should be highlighted.
However, before you start analysing the new model, you must say that this new Jazz appears six years later after the first generation had occurred on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other producers, renewed this model for a shorter time.
Although Honda Jazz is less in Europe, this model is a phenomenon regarding its sale on other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where the Jazz is the most acquired car of 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After the Jazz occurred on the market, only in Japan was a million models.
The second subparagraph was the old continent, with about half a million busy cars in six years.
However, Honda is trying to add the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese company covered a total of 83,000 models of Jazz in 2007, the expecting rates are 10,000 cars, which are 17% of the adoption of growth on the market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, which are 6.7% of the total market in Honda in Spain.
As regards the new generation of the model, the leaders in Spain expect to get 2 000 Jazz models per year.
As a result, the new Honda Jazz model is enabled to interfere with the purchase in Spain.
In fact, the leaders of the mark hope to end the year with a total of 22 000 models, which are 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain in the previous year (1.6 %) to 1.8 %.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to achieve 2 % in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda sets up the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybridaut with 5 doors and a comprehensive size of 4,7 meters long, the Japanese company hopes to increase about 200 000 models per year throughout the world.
According to the market assessments of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of insight models are being sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed in the old continent and Japan.
The appearance of the Insight on the market is intended for the first months of the year, for the first time his public representation will be found in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz in all its sizes.
His length is 3.90 metres (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 metres (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 metres, which leads to the assumption that he has increased 5 centimeters.
The height, however, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
In addition to increased dimensions, the internal space is also increased.
This success is, on the one hand, to thank the new space flexibility programme and the other side, the central position of the tissue container, a solution that was also used in the Jazz front model.
In addition, the capacity of the kofferra, which has a system of double lade area, reaches up to 339 litres, so 19 litres greater than the capacity of the kofferra of the first generation.
It must be emphasized that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4-liter benzin engine because the capacity of the Kofferra of Honda Jazz with a 1,2-liter benzin engine is 379 litres.
In addition to improvements, other than associated facility elements such as seats of leadership or the possibility of panorama windows, a improved access to the seat sites will be offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, and the first jazz had only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of his confusion, this small model has 2 exhibitions of gas engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have a system of i-VTEC that allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 outputs, have excellent technical performance and simultaneously makes a road-momental performance for the whole engine course.
The first variant with 1,2 litres achieves the performance of 90 PS and 6 000 rotations with a maximum turnmoment from 114 Nm to 4 900 min?1 .
This benzine engine - the Jazz's precursor model reached 78 PS - has 5,3 litres of benzine consumption and CO2 output of 125 grams.
With regard to the foreground engine that reached 83 PS in the previous generation, he can now come to 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5,4 litres of benzine consumption and 128 grams of CO2.
'Auto-Biene', which avoids collisions
In order to promote the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired by nature this time, more accurately, by the birds.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight returns to the heat behaviour of birds and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technology for accident prevention.
The Engineers from the Technical Development of Nissan Motor Co. developed these small robots in collaboration with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the Renamed University of Tokio (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the leader technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-level Nissan security schedule.
This robot will ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
With the currency of the flight, each bubble builds its own, oval-formed flight, which is very similar to Nissan security schedule.
However, the most important is the facetnaugens of the bones that can see over a angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows you to flee in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to imitate the round perspective, the technicians developed the Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notes obstacles that are located before the BR23C in a distance of up to two meters, and in a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a tabled microprocessor, which is directly translated into a signal for the avoiding the collision
`In the moment when obstacle is noted, the small robot will imitate the fucking flight and immediately change the direction by turning his speech around 90° or more angles to avoid the collision.
The largest subdivision to any other systems is that this development over is absolutely instinct.
If not, the robot could not be able to respond with sufficient speech to avoid obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory for mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
In the subsection to a bone, the robot can not move up or down, but also not overcover; he can only move to two dimensions and to the direction that allows him to turn his talkers and not to the infinite directions and in the infinite way of making the birds.
For this reason, near acceleration and breathing functions, Nissan used the rotation function to avoid the collisions of the small robots.
`This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and to act according to these information.
It does not require to save the information or the intuitive logic of the managers made, therefore it can continue to work with a few thousands of KB of the memory.
It sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the memory.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will introduce in the series cars in the next years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are easier and keep longer than lithium ione batteries.
Another possible application of these technologies in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS processing system through satellite to lead to the goal and to avoid obstacles on the road.
She's at the point before it is charged with a hypothek.
It must be considered that the United States Financial Ministry, unless it is available for sufficient liquidity to provide support, but it is not without check.
Before the crisis, and to avoid that US citizens in hypotechnical discussions of the expected payable banks were developed a comprehensive and informative game for the Internet surfer: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it is called.
Or maybe the `Hotel of bad credits' or of one another.
The aspect of this accommodation and particularly his receptionist is to reflect on one, twice and up to three times, whether it is the moment to ask no credit.
And especially where you can do it, whatever is likely the goal of the game.
She certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is better one page for the teenages than a place for all viewers.
What will be done when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dreaming room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it isn't about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides her capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entrance of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) in its companies, which would be the first bank in Japan, which issued nine billion, and thus takes 21% of their capital, a renewal that would lead to a strong case of their rental.
One week after a provisional agreement was made public, the two banks explained that MUFG 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's staff would be purchased at a single price of 25.25′, which would result in a total of three billion.
The accepted price is less than 19% of the asset rates from 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional investments in the acquisition of conversionable assets that will be able to ensure a winning of 10% and can be restored to a price of 31,25%.
Morgan Stanley explained that the world business is operated on the basis of a single average price of 29, thus 28 % over the current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's action was decreased by 6.79% against 17.00 GMT at 23.07.
'This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank,' said John Mack, Director-General of the Ananian Group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this status last week to enable him to expand their business to new areas, but in view of the Federal Reserve.
Your connection with MUFG also assures that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to become a much more careful attitude than before.
The modes presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed during the last days: the last Monday Morgan had clearly explained that it would cover up to 20% of its actions for approximately 8.5 billion to Japan.
'Before a week', Tokio Toshihide Mizuno, business leader of the MUFG, said we'd believe that the contribution would be completely from tribe.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% for its Morgan Stanley actions under their rate.
And the business will take place with a decrease of winning about 20% per action.
The agreement provides that MUFG can turn the half of its preferential acts into stammakties in one year, if late mentioned within a given period are replaced by more than 50% over the sales value, so about 47%.
Morgan Stanley assures that the money supplied by MUFG will allow him to use investment opportunities to strengthen and increase their sales.
However, a press speaker of the group refused to make more accurate information on the strategy of the two new associates.
After MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to buy a payment rate of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his Bie’s 'deeply' had been reduced since the end of August.
The last weeks were heavy for the group who had to look at how their rate was back around the half, while the price for insurance against paying incapacity was quick to the height.
This price returned on Monday, but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only `Overliving' of the large investment banks at the Wall Street after the concurrence of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's uptake, announced last week, 15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic re-based the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common hall of the Venices Hugo Chavez, the Bolivians Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
That third was the one who followed the example of his equals and friends this Sunday, the plan of a new Constitution.
The mission is fulfilled because, according to the 80% of the public results of the voters, 64% of the voting votes were equal to 'Yes'.
According to these results, 28% were `No', 7% of the election notes were invalid and 0.7% were released empty.
In order to prevent the Constitutional project, a vote must be achieved more than the aid of all votes issued.
On Sunday, two questions carried out at the outcome of the elections and an announcement of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for 'Yes', and 63% to 70% prophesied him.
In addition, on Sunday night on Monday, Rafael Correa requested the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution triumphed in overwhelming way', he had assured the equatorians in Guayaquil, the seat of the Government 280 km southwest of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was welcomed by Chávez and Morales, but also by Chile likewise Michelle Bachelet.
The election held in silence under the Observatory Regulation of the United States (OAS) was related to a text of 444 points to ensure the 'new socialism' for which the President is employed.
The Constitutional Project transfers the State power to the economy by granting it the only right to 'the development planning' in a country, which is largest than the earthly oil promotion by foreign companies and the devises sent the emigrants to the country.
The project proposed by Correa selected in 2006 also provides more power to the Governing Boss, which will be able to exercise up to two follow-up mandates every four years and will have the opportunity to resolve the national assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free health and education, which the President has already started, to introduce in this country with 13,9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live under the poverty border.
Finally, it also expects to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorian support point as the start station for anti-drogen rates.
The 19 ships were released in Chad
A Egyptian command started the attack on the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ago.
You're in Kairo.
The eleven tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the wilderness for 11 days, were returned to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
They were released by a Egyptian command in Tshad tomorrow.
Apparently in the state, the ships at 15.30 a.m. reached the military point of al-Maza directly next to the international airport of Kairo.
They were directly brought to the board of a helicopter at the hospital of Maadi, a foreign quarter of Kairo, to be investigated there.
They are pleased with all 'best health' and the deductors 'no redemption', said the Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the Rollfield.
After being taken captive on 19 September at a foreign car Safari at the foot of the Mount Ouanat in the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of ships was still brought by a hidden by 35 unrecognized deducers.
It is eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffers, a border officer and the director of the Agency of Egypt, Safari.
A Egyptian security responsibility explained that 30 members of the special units, from the board of two helicopters, have started the attack night, shortly before the morning dining.
'The two sides of the shoes fell, and the help of the deductors was killed, the rest fled,' said the responsibility that wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that 150 members of Egyptian special units were sent to Sudan, where they received support by German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomates Franco Frattini reported from the advice where he is right now played about the role, secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
'We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and the special units', he explained without further details.
He also concluded that a redemption was paid.
At the earlier evening, the Sudan army claimed to have taken a landing vehicle at a patrol, where the deputers, of whom they were six, including the leaders of the Chad, killed and two arrests.
The army explained that they were connected to a rebellion group from Darfour, the movement of Libération du Sudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, occurred immediately.
Letters - The quiet majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes lines and is a central topic of the current election fight.
It's better.
But a area of our cultural life remains in forgotten.
Who will rise up and deal with the inheritable sums that will be granted hungry to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places?
Which more will it be able to remind the Federal Government that it deteriorates its thoughts and culturally significant buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that our culture is effective?
Did you know that the French Government provides 3.5 million euros only for the auration of the Chinone closure in Loiretal?
In our neighbors, the Constitution of their country states that the protection of the culture belongs to the American culture, and that this culture must be justified by all citizens, all members and all government interests, and in mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the History Society Association of Quebec, at least 400,000 honourable servants gathered in 211 historical companies are trying to consider intensely with the history, to save the number of archives and to get the archaeological remains.
They are also often the warehouse of our culturer, which protest with the power of the discharge, when the promotors and decisionmakers leave their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten peacehouse.
When will there be a stage for history and culture?
Benelux Governments of the Fortis Bank's national parts
In part, the Benelux states of the Belgian-Nederland Fortis Bank, which is held in Turbulence by the United States Financial Crisis, would want to be armed: the three States shall provide the Banking and Insurance Institute, which also has discharges in Hungary, in total EUR 11,2 billion.
The Governments of the European Central Bank, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level on weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the competitive of the European Commission.
In the euro zone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial crisis which has been suspended since a year, and therefore may have a preliminary character of decisions that are now taken in connection with the bank.
In the meaning of the decision taken on Sunday evening, all three countries purchasing the respective shares of the bank at approximately 49%.
The Bank will probably decrease a part of its shares before all the insurance samples covered by the Netherlands ABN Amro last year.
Fortis's actions have started a steady road last week, and in the second week half, serious crisis scenarios have already occurred.
However, the analystes agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is too large for a pleit.
The institution's value papers fall 12% in a 14-year depth on Friday.
Since Jinneres, the value of the shares has decreased over two thirds.
In view of the current share rate, the market value of the group is EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic, but is unrealistic.
According to the management, USD 700 billion teure-ananish salvation package and the uncertainty that has been resolved on the markets is due to the fortis's activity.
However, on Monday, the courses were easier.
On Friday, Philip Dierckx was appointed as a new Director-General of the Bank.
The money institution was also searching for a buyer, but it was not interested in a business boat.
Instead, the Belgian Government was attempted to repair - no investor would have to cut off his money, he said.
The customers have not been paniced until that time, the bank's halts have not been disturbed.
In Hungary, the Fortis is aware of self-subsistents, but it also calls her own leasing forms.
Fuchs in the kitchen
As a result of human medical consumption, life and hospital in America often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data Protection Experts ensure that the data could be uncontrolled.
"The data protection programmes are linked to the approval of the concerned.
These should be in independent hand, elsewhere we trust the chickens in the fuch" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for the follow-up of recording data.
Insurance shall fix taxes and payment amounts in the case of damage depending on the customer's health status, and if the risk is too high, the insurance will not be completed.
Previously, the customer was sent to its investigation, and the contract was only concluded in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Dick learned a much more favorable method for the recent half years from the apothechics, and the program calculates the illness of the customer and how its health status is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterin reduced medicines, it was followed that his blood fat level was untreated, which would automatically specify it into a risk group.
There are several versions of the program in the course - some even define a risk multiplicator, so the insurance needs only to make more the paper frame, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the insects is that many medicines can be taken for different purposes, such as migrons and heat choices, but also against depression.
Lastly, in the view of the insurer, it is a high-risk factor, while those are not mentioned before.
For the question and processing of data, their own companies have been formed, before they relate to the data, requesting the patients to agree.
In the meantime, they have to do that by law, although they have not yet been dismissed.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory studies and connect them to the medical consumption data, which provides a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More companies have access to the data and control of their use will be weaker at the same time.
Although there is a own data protection legislation for health data, its effect is only addressed to services in the health sector and insurance.
The draft legislation has already been submitted to the Congress, where the authorities may also control data processing forms.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is too few, so he wants to continue developing his program so that the data can be transmitted only with the understanding of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned is not able to ignore access to his data, since the insurance is not a contract with him elsewhere.
And thus the kitchens have been left just like the G's of the furnace.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are two-side trade partners of each other, this was the main topic of other global problems in the nineteen-year-old meeting.
Today, the French and Indian Gipfel is also located, in particular on the cooperation in the Atom Energy sector.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an exciting, democracy power that should be given more votes and withdrawal rights in international statements, however, the Member States could not even be able to conclude whether they should submit the continuous membership of New Delhis in the United Nations Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed last night at the nineth gipfel meetings in Marseille.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian President Manmohan Singh. There was an agreement to double the trade in the next five years, i.e. at approximately 100 billion euros.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 was reached from 25 to 55 billion, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this regard, the 26 existing civil aircraft agreements with India have also been legally assembled to an agreement, so that the air traffic will be forbidden in future.
By 2009, India wants to submit the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the package.
The objective is to make a balance currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: the Union of the partners is one Indian number, New Delhi is only in the range of nine EU partners.
The gipfel was divided into the global advice.
It included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as the terrorism, which both sides were condemned at the highest level.
Moreover, the Doha round should be completed, both sides are schuldige to the board.
The EU emphasised that it maintained its energy and climate programme, which means reducing damage emissions by at least 20% until 2020.
This was also agreed in India, just as the proposal was to close a kind of global compromise in the coming climb, and to reduce the production of gases to 2050 to 50%.
Moreover, price increases in food should be combatted, therefore both undertaken the implementation of a international conference on the issue of financial crisis.
The Governing Boss of India today visits the French capital, where he will undertake an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, there are 20 billion French companies in order to build atomic reactions in India.
According to Agency's reports, the agreement shall be concluded at 15 years.

The small aircraft of the billioner Steve Fosset re-detected a year ago
The small aircraft of Steve Fossett, who was missing a billion years in a flight over the wilderness of Nevada on 3 September 2007, was found.
The parts were found on a 3000 m high plateau, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the States of California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human residues.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely discovered the last doubts during a press conference: "The flight has been located on a troop. Now we have the security that it is the flight that Steve Fosset flew on the day of his destruction."
Mr. Anderson also noticed that there were no human residues found in the aircraft or near it.
The 63-year-old billion was declared to be dead in February.
The Safety Office (Ntsb) noticed that a manship was spent a few hours after the aircraft view, which identified the machine: it was Bellanca 8kcab lost on 3 September 2007 after the start of a 3-hour flight in Yerington in Nevada.
Yesterday, some of the personal objects of Fosset from a couple near their home at the Mammoth Lakes were found in California, near the border to Nevada.
This is two evidences called Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation of Illinois, bars and a Jacke.
The search for Fosset was abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billioner had obtained a place in the history through a long result of records.
In 2002, in the sixth course, he was the first man to surround the worldball in a heavy airball: a two-week, single flight.
Three years later, he flew the world into a single flight without interlanding with a flight.
Under his own records, a height flight of 15445 m is also over the second, however, with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv that falls through its original design and the special line management, the outloading surface and its clear angles from the original scheme.
Mercedes-Benz tried with this offerer to put the sector into a new spirit.
Just due to his exceptional features, the presentation of Suv Glk will also occur unconventionally, which will be seen since 17 October in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz.
Thus, the public troops that will be accompanied by the appearance of the new model will also occur in a new clothing, namely in a 3D campaign – this is a new news in the car sector in the resting Italy.
A project with a maximum impact that will be carried out in various phases that the central shopping miles may be taken to Corso Como until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, where 3D brillies that are distributed near Corso Como are to provide the whole special optical: the new suv will appear in its nearly real dimensions as a model of three dimensions.
In fact, the car will appear so apparently from the place on which it is drawn.
This will be lighted in all its details by means of the elumina8 technology of the new glk at different moments to restore it as a whole.
Of course, it is to introduce a new type of authoreclame in this easier stereotype field with this advertising.
But will it be possible to travel to the interest of the future buyers? We will see it.
Now it's clear who the Italian Hooligans are.
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium prohibition
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole Italian is now shameful? They are part of the grouping "Ultras Italia", which has been traveling behind since years of the Italian nationality and who, honestly, have not caused serious problems until recently.
Never came to coincidence with engineering fans until now.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The promotors are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, other smaller grouping from the campaigns and apoles were drawn to them.
They are the Tricolori in which the cities of the military are appeared: but they were remote on Saturday to avoid employment.
Your examples are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a comparison with a real right-radical fans, that of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans were available 144 cards for the game: all were published on names and therefore easily controlled.
In fact, they were also controlled by the Viminal: among those traveling to Sofia, no one had a running stadium prohibition procedure.
Four fans of the Italian community, which had already been preloaded in this regard, were also rejected by the ticket and traveling to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the tifosi arrested or identified in the emergency with a stadium prohibition of at least five years.
This is a international prohibition that prevents access to stages throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is more than 150 points of conformity, which could follow these little more than 150.
"This fire must be exposed immediately and that such behaviour does not have the opportunity to be justified" means the Viminal.
That's why, "The eye on, especially, also with touch on the game of nationality at midweek in Lecce."
Because in fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Apules.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sport Survey) will be gathered on Sunday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, so the secret services that are occupied with the problem of the stadium walt.
"Duce Duce Call and the exalted right arm during the hymne of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a criminal..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzi® (deeply in no pleasure), which has been on the vicinity for a few weeks by the director of Osservatorio (he took the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Earlier, Mazzi · the police president of Trieste, where now a core of Ultra is founded in 2002.
Although it is true, Mazzi replies that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but, of course, the behavior of these 150-200 people was a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – f · to add the number 1 of Osservatorio – crimes are injured in their country.
This group had been held in the hall until now, but now it has to be overcome what happened and was going to happen.
But we are also talking about the pigs during the Hymne Mamelis: this is not a crime, but they allow me, but the education is missing..."
