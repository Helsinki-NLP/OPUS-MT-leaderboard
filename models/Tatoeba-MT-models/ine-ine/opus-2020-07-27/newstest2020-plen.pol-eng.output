Joseph's father Witko: I saw Jesus in the white stone
He's a charism.
For his devotion of freedom and healing, the crowds draw to them.
He was a couple of years when his life started to happen invisible things.
Today, through the franciscans, others have experienced this.
For the o. Witco's freedom and healing of the crowds
Sometimes the parents of a 7-year-old kid came to him, who had a wheel of 7,5 mm in the heart.
It should have been operated.
Joseph’s father Witko prayed for him.
On the same day, the boy's got to go to the hospital for a time.
The surprises of the doctors said: "The operation is not necessary, the rest is almost 1.5 mm."
Parents were lucky.
Following another prayer, the franquisian wheat disappeared completely.
The spiritual nerge has started to experience a teenager.
In his dreams, pure souls came to him with a request for help.
I was wake up in the night and invited to pray for the dead and those who were dead at the present time.
He also experienced the presence of the spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a dead sin.
“My body began to change.
I lost human characteristics and I started taking up the view of the animal," he says.
The invisible force dropped him up, and you couldn't take a voice from itself.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him a salvation.
“I was released in the waters of the river symbolizing the baptism of the holy, and I was returned to the human form...” he said.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
There's been a call in him.
He was 16 years old when he came to the French.
In the preaching work, he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Charism community Renew in the Holy Spirit
In the mixes of the health of father Witko, many people are involved in avoiding illness.
However, spiritually stressed that their main goal is spiritual health, not physical.
First infringement of FRAC Jarosław
Today (26 September p.m.) the afternoon team of Kol FRAC has been served to the current police Dartom Bogorii Grodzisk Grodzisk Mazowiecki team in the 3st series of LOTTO Superligi Tenisa Table.
Jaroslawing in such a personal station, which they have been stuck with the farmers, has no chance of winning with the sovereignties of the ligue.
He's shown that a single one with Dart Bogoria.
In the team, there is no pressure called for the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps, in the combined composition, the yarslaving would be a third of the triumph series in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han is probably not yet growing to win with such myths as Grek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Paul Sir ́ek.
Not even with one of the most perspicuous Poland, or the Badow Mark.
The leader from Hellady was the biggest star in the MOSiR Hall at the ul. Sicorski in Jaroslav.
Similarly, at the beginning of Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was the same class for himself.
After three individuals, FRAC led 2:
Kou Lei certainly played Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak after the emotional, five-year-old battle — Paul Siruck.
But then he was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei the chance.
It could have been hoped to win for two points, but Qiyao Han didn't break the Badowian.
There'll be no tests for the elders.
Why?
According to the orders of Rafala Trzaskowski, a free prevention programme for age 70 and 80 had been implemented in Warszawa.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been accepted by the Ministry of Health and the Protection of Medical Technology and Certificate Agency.
In justification, the Agency said that the target group was wrongly administered.
“The effects may affect the detection of honoured disease units, which may affect the deepness of the difficulty in access to NFZ supply and negatively affect the patient, causing non- and discomfort related to false positive studies”, was observed.
The resort decision doesn't understand the president of the throne.
"The money are ours, we've provided the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that people are testing, then they will go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it's just about to get to the situation where the prevention can be made faster.
All specialists know that it helps, it is about the pollution of the health system, because it helps to quickly detect diseases and in a fair approach to health.
The government has a very strange position that I don't understand," Rafał Trzaskowski said.
"I can be sure to imagine that the big specialists say, "We don't be sure, because there will be a longer range in the doctor, and if these specialists advise the government, I don't wonder that there is a health service in this situation," he added Policy PO.
Palestinian answers Israel: We will save all present agreements
The Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at the United Nations Assembly meeting that he will break any agreements concluded with Israel if the government of this country tries to fulfil Benjamin Netanjah's command of an anxiety of the Palestinian land.
"If the government of Israel comes, which will come to the fulfillment of this plan, we will reject all the signed agreements (with Israel) and we will reject all the commitments taken," he said.
"Out of the complete and completely all the plan," he threatened with the pressure of Abbas.
"It's our way to protect all of our rights with all possible centres – less important, which will be the consequences – committing completely to the application of international law and combating terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Autonomy, who had already made similar actions in July.
Netanyahu, the current president of Israel, again replied the mission of the Government on 17 September.
A week before the elections he said that if he wins them, he will announce anxiety to the valley of Jordan and intends to join all Jewish residences in Israel on the East Sea.
At the beginning of the 1990 ’ s, Israel and the Palestinians, whom Jaser Arafat was conducted, signed a number of peace agreements that were held by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during the United Nations United Nations Assembly to take place in Palestinian countries of general elections.
The last occurred in 2006.
"When I return to the country, I will call on the West Sea, the Gaza Region and the Eastern Jerusalem, local elections and everyone who would oppose them will have to respond for their actions before God and the international community," said the Palestinian president.
Abbas also defended in his speaking of the Palestinian rights, treated as a permanent holder in the United Nations, for the use of the rights of the United Nations, as well as all its bodies and in-.
The Palestinian leader concluded with the call to the international community to "force Israel to fulfil the whole respect of the United Nations positions".
The ambassador of Israel, Danny Danon, replied shortly to Abbas, declared that the Palestinian leader would “concentrate himself in the United Nations on the efforts of the Palestinian Autonomy against Israel rather than fight against calls to terrorism in Autonomia under his leadership”.
However, as noted by the agencies, Danon did not refer to the anexions of Palestinian lands occupied by Netanjah.

The aim of the GameINN sectoral programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Poland industry of video games on the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Poland video games are already growing at 10% per year.
According to the government data, the Poland market value of the video game in 2016 was 1.85 billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion.
"The specially prepared GameINN Bajèk agenda, which has already reached 300 million evil support for the Europeans in the framework of this sectoral programme, constitutes a significant impulse for the further, dynamic growth of the Poland gamedevu," it is stated in the communication.
Branz video game is a perfect example of the effective use of the potential we are available in Poland.
“The Government's encouragement for innovations, such as B+R, skills, IP box or support programmes implemented by the NCBR provides for innovative enterprises and allows them to enhance the higher competition in the market”, evaluates the vicepremier, minister of School and School of Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the communication.
The Science Boss notes that money for innovation is not only to innovators in the form of project finance, but also to be in their boxes – from B+R in 2018, three fourth more than the previous year before ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­  ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­
“The amount of the estimated costs for the activities of B+R was 1.7 billion wrongs, which had increased over 300 million insurance for companies using this deficiency.
This is the equality of the support transmitted by NCBR in three GameINN editions," subscribes the vicepremier.
Director NCBR Dr. Kamenecki also reminds that in two previous consequences of financing with a total value of over 211,2 million evil was granted to 78 new projects.
Great interest in the III concurrence and the diversity of the proposed proposals shows that a huge video game has ideas and skills to continue to develop and increase its competitive priorities.
“It is a pleasure for the fact that, as in previous editions, projects on solutions that serve not only a divorce but also related to industry 4.0 have been added.
In the Third Court of GameINN for finance, even 20 million of evils could be avoided from the beneficiaries, the consortians and the consortians with scientific units.
The NCBR had 87 applications on the total amount of finance of approximately 317 million.
The budget of the concurrence was 100 million evil at the time of the advertising of the concurrence, but it was increased, thus 27 projects were granted almost 105 million of malfinancing.

The NCBR adopted the program in 2016 in response to the initiative associated with the Polish Game Agreement, which includes firms such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studies.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga admitted to the stealing of Caspera Dolberg's cloud
It happened on September 16th.
Dolberg, who at the end of August traveled from Ajaks Amsterdam to Nice, focused on the training that his clothes disappeared.
It wasn't like that, because the value of 70 euros is the value of those euros.
The wounded Danish on the next day did not appear on jobs, faced with the problems of the world.
It was a question from the beginning.
Pylars in clothing have private seifs, and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP agency, he was approved at the end of Diaby-Fadiga.
18 years ago, he apologized Dolberg and the rest of colleagues from the team and Dr. Patrick Vieira.
He also promised Danish to return money for a hour.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most perspicuous pillars of the young generation in France.
He traveled to Nicei as a three-year-old man to debit three years later in the first team.
In this season, he appeared at seven shots.
He did not sign a professional contract, but, as under the newspaper "L'Equipe", the club probably solve it with the immediate effect.
In this case, he has invoked the discipline against his leader.
Nice, at least officially, refuses comments on this matter.
Check if you're sure you're smiling your hands well
We all know that you need to kiss them (e.g. when you come home or before the rest).
But not everyone knows that to actually lose the insects, we need to do it properly.
This is particularly important now when heat infections are approached.
At least 30 to 40 seconds to get adequately dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
And most of us are smaller!
It's uncertain that it must be antibacterian (a lot of doctors who are probably advising them).
By shaking, we are not only the bottom and the top of the hands but also: the fingers of the fingers (unmounted or separately) – get them with the cold moves inside the second hand, the space between the fingers (paying the hands, throwing the fingers on itself), the tissues – each one we put on the other hand, and in this area we turn them a second time to the right and the left.
In an average situation (when you can't slip your hands) we should cut hands with a cushion mocker and then with an antibacteric iron (in drugs, from 5 zl).
Following the public toilet, do not touch the hands of the clothes or the door (Recommendation of the Main Health Inspector).
Open them through the paper manual.
President Iran says he refused the US proposal of talks, Donald Trump refused.
Teheran did not interview with the American side during the United Nations O'O'Assembly in New York, unless the Americans offered sanctions, he declared the President of Iran Hasan Rowhani on Friday.
The president of the United States Donald Trump commented that this is the Iranian side who asked to bring a restriction to which he did not agree.
According to Iran Hasana Rowhani, the Americans proposed to remove all sanctions on Teheran in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.
It should regulate the Iranian nuclear programme as well as the Balistic Point Building Programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not take conversations in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
President of Iran stated that he did not agree to take these talks because of “toxic atmosphere”.
He said he had met American diplomats because he had fallen to France, German and United Kingdom.
However, he emphasized that Iran would not accept talks in the "maximum pressure" atmosphere.
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in form 5+1, no one is able to predict the final result," said Rowhani.
On the previous day, the Iranian leader said that he did not exclude the talks from the United States, and to the parties of the nuclear agreement he engaged in the promotion of the American sanctions in Iran.
He added that sanctions on Iran after the United States of the nuclear agreement are a preliminary condition that does not allow the dialogue to be binding.
If we can take this preliminary condition and if America brings sanctions and the maximum pressure, then we can talk to America -- he declared.
He added that he did not exclude the meeting with the President Donald Trump, although he did not agree on such conversation in a mixing week during the United Nations meeting.
Trump: "Iran," I said no.
Donald Trump was on Twitter that he refused the Iranian page's request.
"Iran wanted me to put down sanctions on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said no. " The President of the United States.
Pressure with atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to fix the pressure between Washington and Teheran to save an agreement with Iran from 2015, which was signatures.
It concluded that, in replacement of the deterioration of Iran's economic sanctions, Iran was rejecting the nuclear protection programme, and the nuclear sector was controlled by the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAEA).
Since the U.S. rejected the agreement in May 2015, its signatures once confirmed that they wanted the agreement in force.
It wasn't going out of this.
Waszyngton applies the tactic of maximal pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include full embargo on Iranian roof.
Teheran claimed that if he doesn't have a sugar export, what 60 days would limit his obligations resulting from the agreement.

The Governing Court of Justice in Warszawa and the husband of the Head of Emilia, who, according to its words and words from WhatsAppa, participated in the stalking against judges, was returned in the middle of the NSA.
Reason: No disciplinary procedure has been initiated against him, and therefore there is no reason to maintain the management of the President WSA Wojciech Mazur to reject it.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary officer at NSA, concluded at the end of August the procedure that explains to Smidt, but it has not been translated to this time in proceeding against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a court of discipline in such areas, must take the decision of the WSA president in a month after its issue.
In this situation, a judge who has publicly discussed its psychical problems to discreet it, which, due to the suspicion of the participation in the Headquarters Group has been taken from the CRS office, will return to the arrest and will issue judgments on behalf of the Polish Policy.
Judge Smydt rejects his participation in the Headquarters Group.
He states that there is no evidence for it but the false words and words of his divorce.
That is exactly the same thing that the rest of the judges related to the "Cast" state: everyone is innocent, no evidence.
And they'll be able to put on their own.
Because the prosecution wasn't cut off the finger to protect the leads from their electronic carriers, it also silenced about the contents of Emilii Smydt's phone, who held this phone in another case in June.
The police didn't kick the fingers to protect the devices of those who as persecutors indicated in bringing Judge Waldemar Jurek from February.
There's no evidence – there's no case of Smidt, no case of Casty.
There is also no case of Boss N° Marian Banasia to deal with a stone to the susteners and to hide income.
The CBA checks his ownership statements.
And she checks when she checks.
The Commission of Poland's Ethics will not be taken by the Banas because Sejm is suspended (but the Commission of State Control has sometimes been gathered to make any decision on the revocation of Banasia's representatives and calling for his lawyers, although the law of such a great combination does not predict).
The whole thing reminds me of a film's novel, the American misfortune, about how she comes home and stands a husband with a lovely man in bed.
She's so disappointed and disappointed that she can't baptism words.
He stands at the doors of that one, and in that time the lovely woman quickly goes out of bed, clothes and goes out.
And the husband stood the bed.
When she repeats the voice and cries: "What is that?"
Who's that woman?
The husband is quietly asking, "What woman, honey?"
Only about Casty or Banasia is a parode of State.
And that's not funny.

Morawicki cornel lives in a severe hospital
He's gone to the hospital, and his doctors' status are too heavy.
You need to add that he's present and we know.
"We believe that it's going to come out that he wins another time.
All of us pray to return to health," the anonymous person of Cornel Moravic transmitted in conversation with the Super Express journalists.
In the nearby elections, the Prime Minister's father candidates to the Senate.
"When I live, I am the nearest family and policy," Cornel Moravicki said in the outcome, which he gave to the Super Express journalists two weeks ago.
The Super Express reported that the 78-year-old Cornel Moravicki traveled to the military hospital in Wroclavy.
“I had a surprise, anxious symptoms, and I went to the hospital.
It was that I had a turnover.
But the worst was before me.
When a computer tomograph test was tested, it was found that I had a new resource of a tube...," the prime's father said.
A few days later in the MSWiA hospital in Warszawi Kornel Moravicki passed a serious operation.
As Morawick told, President André Duda sent his personal captain to Zbigniev Kras in the hospital.
The operation was spent three hours and passed successfully.
“I know that many people prayed for me for what I feel very.
Fortunately, I don't have any more shots.
I don't know if I'm going to go through chemotherapy.
I'm getting in my hands with the doctors of specialists who are rather good thoughts.
So after this hard operation, I have to get back to some useful state.
I hope that everything will be fine," he said in the speaker of Cornel Moravicki in the "SE".
"If I'm too late to study, this situation would be tragic and driving with this..." he added.

It's powerful to loving the springs.
The title of the relationship with amators of sports, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September on the hypodrome at the Oleandry Street in Olavia, may be for the mistake.
The real power of the road is far away, but this is the name of one of the species of rivalisation...
The concurrence of the spot force is to be conquered by the driver and the horse, all-away preventives, which are even more than two meters in the most prestigious international divisions.
It is worth adding here that the world's unbeathen record, established yet in 1949, by the Chilian Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
So high in Olavia no one shot, but the result of the best local amazones at level 135 cm to the worst must not be...
The constructions organized by non-structured Jana Sienkiewicz and other JKS "In Siodle" were an indicative part of the previously played "Withing Road Chambers", which we write greater in this magazine number, page 22.
Eight Amazones traveling in the Olaw JKS were accessed to the rivalisation.
Four were fighting on cooks, and four on big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szoldra's best recording, which reaches the crazy "Sprinter".
This small, but a dynamic brush has been deteriorated from the destruction of a 40 cm height, and just finished at the stationation with a top white remote from the ground at 125 cm.
However, it was not easy to submit and only after three other refuses, the concurrence was removed from further liquidation by the jury.
The second place in the cocktails was taken by Amelia Pawlak, who arrived in "Famy", and the third Lena Boruń on "Harmider".
Ambitally, the youngest tourist - Inga Aksman, a galoping and springing by obstacles on the small "Carmen" clay.
Another more emotions have been associated with the starting amazons and seeing during the competition with the share of big horse.
The horrible falls of Paulin Szewčik, who arrived in “Declarations” and Anastasia Abramenko, who went on the “Floots”.
Fortunately, there was nothing to happen to the horses, and they continued to participate in the concurrence.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the "Wineta" young claim to the park had been achieved by the Veronica lukkiewicz.
She needed a training assistant, or another horse to a couple who's got a little crazy "Wineta".
After calculating an interruption from the park, he also moved with full strength, so for moments in boxes and solutions, it was dangerous. "All is under control!", repaired Jan Sienkiewicz a little of those feared views, especially those younger.
From the beginning of the concurrence of big horses, Marta Masalska is a wonderful park of the "Whisky".
This lock, in a couple of experienced amazon, after the second approach in the final phase, went 135 cm as the first, and it was the best result of the injury at this point.
However, after a time, Paulin Szewczyk also counted the same highlight on “Declarations”, Veronika Łuczkiewicz on “Winete” and Anastasia Abramenko on “Fluges”.
For decoration of the flood and after receiving the cost of the railway equipment, all of these drivers went out together, and at the end with the amazons on the cocktails of Radecki's march, they made an effective honoured round, finishing these interesting and emotional consequences.

The Royal Sport Club “In Siodle” heartly guards the sponsors of the spring force during the 16th “Structure of Railways”: the City Office in Olavia, the Water Tower and Channels Fund in Olawa, the Power Starship and the Mustang company.
Max Column is from KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Colonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Colonko is the name of the electoral committee under which political training #R Revolution Marius Max Columns had to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution addressed its proposal, particularly to young electors of legal views.
Before the elections, Columnko told Mark Jacob, whether Paul Kukis, but it did not come to any of these coalitions, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Colonko himself could not even collect enough number of signatures to present lists in any election circle in Poland.
Now Colonko informed on Twitter that he ended with the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
"I'll be waiting for in/in the KWW to draw my name in my name.
He will, please, take care of the non-connection of my person with the entity referred to in/in," he added and claimed that it would give more information.
In this case it doesn't matter whether the journalist will continue his action, whether it's the end of the training #R Revolution.
4 July, in the American Day Nepodleg, the journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, informed about the new political training - #R Revolution.
In the past years, Colonko has been sent to conduct the YouTube channel Max TV, which comments on events in Poland and the world.
“We have enough politics, enough of your hard games, enough of your government amators.
The time for the authorities in the country to take the Nation and rule for the good of the Nation, said Colonko.
The Partie's programme includes legality (the general elections should be selected), tax changes (free from tax for all), repairs (in the form of aid for the Eastern NATO flag, with the respect of Poland), references on the ownership of the bronze, limitation of the number of members or the introduction of single electoral cities.
A few days after the announcement of the new political training of Mariusz Max Kolonko came to talk with Mark Jacob.
At the end of July, Colonko put on his profile in the medium-free information suggesting that #R's power with Kukiz'15's movement.
However, no of these coalitions finally arrived.
UBS: Gold near the equivalent point
"The euro curs will be held in the nearest months in the areas of 4,35 evil, which will be associated with weak conjunction on global markets," Michael Bolliger said from UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of sustainable economic growth and stability of monetary policy are discussing the stabilization of gold notes at the current floor," assesses the specialist in the talk with Bankier.pl.
His opinion, despite the explicit inflation pressure of the Minor Policy Council, is not decided to subdue steps in the area where the majority of central banks are able to politicize.
“When gold is actually estimated – euro notes should be held in the nearest months in the areas of the floor of 4.35, so few attractives are the Polish obligations according to it.
Much more rental than half papers offer obligations from the markets incoming," evaluates Michael Bolliger, the market shareholder in the UBS Wealth Management markets.
According to a specialist, the main threat to the Poland economy is to increase the conjuncture in the world.
"The global delay can still be deepened, but it should not reach a heavy recess, and the most important to the wall of the PKB dynamic below the zero," Michael Bolliger said.
“Investors should not consider global actions which may be able to damage the lack of trade conflict in the United States and China lines and other geopolitical risk factors, including the impeachment procedure of Donald Trump and brexit.
Europe should be the most weakest among the actions markets," resulted from the newest letter to the UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele investors.
"Actions from the euro area countries should be worse than the Americans because they are more eligible under the conditions of uncertainty around the global trade and fear of slowness," says the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the markets of the most secure countries have reduced the rentality of the German 10-years even to minus 0.74 per cent, it is still possible to deepen the depth of rentality.
Nevertheless, in the longer terms, the rentality of terminal papers should be no longer, but only short-term, in the case of the monetary policy of banks.
The biggest field to be decreased has Fed, which should be to weak the US currency in the next years.
The long-term balance point for euro notes is 1.29 USD, which would mean the 19% potential of strengthening the common currency for dollars.
We expect further decreases of the Fedu feet, which will result in the difference in the monetary policy in the world.
"In order to maintain a long-term dollar force, they may not allow deficits on a bit and budgetary account," says Michael Bolliger.

Kids weeping in the plane.
How can you avoid them?
It's a solution.
The Japan Airlines carrier uses a person's thinking for whom traveling in your child's oldest child is cosmmar.
On the Internet site, the lines can check the distribution of locations in the airport.
If this connection travels to the second year of life, “the child's icon” appears on a specific, reserved by parents or seat holders.
The same person using the transporter services has the possibility of selecting a place remote from the smaller.
The BBC claims that the lines have already informed about the inadequacy of this solution.
“Ikona of the child” does not appear when the ticket was reserved by the third person or if the change of the aircraft at the last time has occurred.
As it could be expected, the idea divided the internautes.
Parts of Twitter players indicate that traveling with children can be resolved using a hearer that reduces the glass.
They're kids, and we've ever been with them.
"We have to learn tolerance, because we shortly start to need maps sitting for breathing mouths, kidding or drinking," said G Sundar.
Another of the internautes said that he had ever hurt his kids in the airplane, but he changed his opinion when he became a parent.
There are also no solutions introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me against cried children during the 13-hour journey," Rahat Ahmed said.

Poland after the first trend in Paris, wait for the last rival
The Poland Sitkars went on Friday first train in Paris, where they would come on Sunday with bruised medal.
The Vitala Heyne's advantaged way to deal with the title has closed the fourth fraud with the Slovenians 1:3 in Lublana.
There was a sound about their troubles from traveling to this individual.
This time, it was unfounded without such problems – on Friday afternoon they went together with the Slovenians to Paris, and a few hours later they were trained in Bercy's hole.
According to the relationships of people in the jobs, the education of world masters was undermined.
As Heaven Michal Mountain Gogol said, this time the main task was not the same practice of the networkary elements.
"We went to the hall, but in most of them it was time for the team.
It was about to get him more along than to train.
To talk, wonder how to rebuild it as a circuit," he reported.
He confirmed that halffinal infringement was a painful lesson equal to the leaders and the training staff.
"We were brutally brought to the earth.
Without two opinions, we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd be back to that sword.
We discussed this sword in the stage, and the trainer talked a lot to the leaders.
As two main frauds indicate the inefficiency in the attack and much worse than the advice with the bottles of situac.
The Slovenians were in this regard much better than we," he analyzed.
His opinion, "White-Red" has not been stressed, in contrast, related to an emergency against a voice and numerous public of the co-governmental tourist.
He acknowledged that the world's masters could sleep a little to the hot road to the halffinal.
“It may be possible that if we were in a group stage, we would like to examine this lesson as soon as we could, and then we would be playing in the next tournament phase.
But it's just if it's a warning," he warned.
Gogol hopes that the wrongdoing related to the fourth wound of Polacom can be able to get into agression in the bridge's sword.
“I hope that we will show our true face then.
There's something to do.
The latest medal of the ME we were fighting in 2011," he reminded.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by the Poland during these campaigns.
At the group phase, they were rivalized in Rotterdame and Amsterdam, at two first meetings of the group, they went to Apeldoorn and moved to Lublana to halffinal.
Nick Kyrgys: Serious punishment but in suspension
The Italian tennisist was a 16-week bound for starting and a 25-year-old dollars - in a half-year delay - for misleading words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tourneys.
Today the ATP World Tour loses patience to Kirgisha, but the press still gives him a chance of improvement.
The summary of the most uncircumcised tennisists in the last years seems to be terrible – 16 weeks of interruption plus a lot of calamity, but both penalties are injected for a half year – the test period in which the sporter's covering will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgys has only 24 years, but has already developed a long time and has made his tennis record of the world – he had to pay the most in the history of the discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of behavior on the corte and near it.
Voice curses, strange gestures, unsported behavior, a judge and vision, breaking two rackets during the lost sword with Karen Chacznow – for this all after the August tour of ATP Masters 1000 in You ́innati paid 113 thousand dollars.
In the US Open 2019, he also did not play, but publicly said that the ATP operators were “corrupted”, which affected the organizational authorities so much that they had implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kirgisistan and after a few weeks had given a mentioned quota on the suspending of starts and another harmful.
However, the word of corruption was forgiven to him, after hearing the accused and recognition of the context of the expression.
However, in the justification of tenis operators, the investigation showed that the behavior of Kyrgyosa through the past 12 people in many places had a significant caution and was almost a deterioration of the rules that he had without interruption in the way of a vulgar person related to tourisms and visions.
However, the ATP gave him the days for the revocation and immediately refused the execution of the sentence, ordering the compliance in the nearest six conditions: in the tourists of ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kirgisis, the code of the procedure applicable to professional tennisists can no longer be cursed, destroyed, stripped with judges and publicity, or other ways to behave inappropriate and vulgar.
He also received a recommendation to seek "the train of support" from mental trainers during tournamental tourisms, and also consulted other than the season with specialists in resolving the problems of sporters who do not care for proper behaviour.
The first comment (in the medical media) was Nick Kyrgios to the standing: “Hey, all of you, I can play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practical practice, he will have at least two-week breaks, since in Puchare Lavera, he had to stop the construction of the ship, so he had to reject from the nearest starts in Peking (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
In the morning of the ATP Kirgistry for the 27th place.
In this year, he won two tours – in Washington and Acapulco, gained more than 1,3 million down, so even after his shoes there will be a lot to him.
GUS: Life in Poland is better
From the report published on Friday by the GUS on the budgets of the households, it is evident that, as good or better, its material situation was evaluated in ub.r.r. up to 44% of them.
The year before, this percentage was 37.2 per cent, in 2016 33.5 per cent and before – since 2009, when the statistical authority first examined the situations of the households – he never exceeded 30 per cent.
As a bad or more, its material situation was considered in total 8,1 per cent of the households, compared to 11,2 per cent of the year before and more than 20 per cent in 2009.
The best is the material situation of householders working on their own accounts.
In this group, more than 70 percent of respondents are considered good or better.
In the second place, the households are rental, where the percentage of such responses was at least 18 per cent.
The number of children also has great impact on the subsequent evaluation of the situations of the household industry.
The worst is known to parents with a single - growing offspring, among whom 32 percent of good or more material situations are well - known.
The weight (in dependence on the number of children) between 55 and 60 per cent of children and 48.8 per cent among the unkind households.
In these statistics, the effect of the programme 500+ is clearly visible.
Before he was uruchomed (in 2016) the worst material situation of their parents were assessed by a single growing descendant and a multi-year-old family (with at least three children).
The improvement of the subsequent evaluation of Poland's material situations is the rapid growth of income, especially from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households who consider their situation better increases faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of leadership, there is no clear dependence between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best evaluations form the residents of the opolary leader, where their situation is good or better than 48.9 per cent of the studies.
The leadership of the Lithuanian (47.7%), the salt (47.6%), the massive (47.3%) and the Western Sea (47.1%).
However, in Opolsk, the regulatory income (i.e. after payment of taxes and fees) was 94% of the average national and 98% of Lubusk.
The best income of the Mazovic residents (120 per cent of the average national) and Slawish (104 per cent).
The medium in Poland, regulatory income per person, was in 2018, 1693.
In fact, it increased by 4,3 % at 2017 (with the correction of price changes).
On the background of the past years, it's the result quite low.
In 2016, the investment per person increased by 7 per cent, and the year later by 6,3 per cent.
Although the growth of income is discharged, it also reduces the growth of expenditure.
These, in conversion to person, have been reported in ub. 1187, which means that they have actually decreased by 0.7 per cent.
This is the first case since 2013.
In 2017, expenses per person were actually increased by 1.9% and in 2016 by 4.3%.
The household budget studies suggest that the statistical economy currently issues 70.1 per cent of its regulatory incomes, while that share exceeded 80 per cent in 2014 and 90 per cent in 2006.

United States: Three suicide among the aircraft
Three mariners have done the last week of suicide at the USS George H. W. Bush ship – informed the American marine.
In the last two years, five members of the stock of this ship have been killed.
Previous suicide occurred in July of that year, and previously in November 2017.
As CNN gives, all three mariners were shot last week.
Each of the events occurred on the floor when USS George H. W. Bush bucked at Virginia's state coast.
As before, the share of third parties has been excluded.
Moreover, death should not be connected.
“It needs all to be involved in presenting suggestions and ideas, how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no gammatisation or other effects related to the search for help," he replied on Facebook Sean Bailey, the leader of the ship.
Increasingly critically on the paper.
John Paul II did nothing
In the conversation with Peter Lexic Stefan Nesiołowski, John Paul II was a great authority in 1981 for opposition operators.
"In fact, his opinion was accepted."
Later the criticism of his actions appeared.
“For me, that John Paul II was not able to eliminate the damage of Rizik’s damage, he is a great shadow on his pontification.
The Remptorist, the damage of the Church and the Poland, has developed its media in the best of the life of Poland's father's life," he.
The former Policy of PO admitted: “There were unconscious deaths, the father said something, the Ridji was never accepted, but he had authority and politicians, and he could simply remove him from the Church or send him to a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do this, just as his followers," explained Nesioslovski.
“In addition, this fatal matter of pedophilia and the Church’s actions has occurred, and in fact they are missing.
I ran a little away from my mind, but I wanted to take attention to the whole life of his life.
We know about the scale of pedophility in the Church from relatively unfair.
The question appears how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know of these abominable things," says in the conversation with the journalist Nesiolovski.
In an evaluation of the former Po Policy, the Poland Church is a partner of PiS.
“We must admit that the Church was our most important association during the Solidarity.
All the holidays began from the sacred mixture, all the cross were crossed everywhere.
Now these cross are written, they became the symbol of the dictature -- the sign of the writing mode.
I repeat: One of the most uncomfortable surprises is that such people as Ridjiz the third Poland Church that John Paul II did nothing about this and that the Church is a partner of PiS.
This is the black Chapter of the Polish Church for which he will come to pay his salt," Nesiolovski convinced.
"I hope that Dad Franciszek will hurt the Yudrahew, Ridjika and a couple of other types," he summarized.

Someone shot a wind-shirt.
In the campsite at the Lower Street, the people have had a cluster with a wings problem.
After taking away and visiting the veterinarian, somebody had set aside the animal’s target — in his body, a windstorm was found.
“Information about the rare bird has been made by the people of the village Centre of the Rehabilitation of Wild Animals in New Sole.
The report showed that the animal had broken wings.
We've been in the place.
It was once to see something's wrong with him.
We did quickly and precisely so that we didn't hurt him and didn't put it on stress.
The lab was buried, and he'd get to the veterinary.

Gowin: "We need to build the Poland, small trade"
"Successful taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to wonder whether the State has some instruments to build the Poland trade," said Vicepremier, Minister for Science and School, leader of the Jaroslav Gowin Agreement on Friday.
Gowin during the conversation in the “Signals of the Day” in the Radio One stated that the trade is based on international networks that are so low to the Poland producers that the Poland companies cannot actually develop.
In view of the very difficult fight against this problem, vicepremier reminded that the Government of PiS tried to meet it at the beginning of the mandate, but had “contact from the KE”.
"We have won before the Court of Justice and I hope that the United Right wins them the nearest elections and forms the government, we will return to this issue," he said.
At the same time, he noted that "the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Poland, and thus a small trade".
"It will also be necessary to consider whether the Government, the State, has some instruments that allow the Poland trade to build," Gowin said.
In May, the EU court recognized that the European Commission made a mistake by recognizing that the Poland tax from the sale of details is unleased by public aid.
Detailed tax provision for the application of two tax rates from the market: 0.8 per cent from the income between 17 million evil and 170 million malicious and 1.4 per cent from the income.
The tax was applicable from September 2016.
In September 2016, the KE started a process of violation of the Union law by Poland.
Brussels said then that the taxation could make less stores, which could be considered as public assistance.
She concluded that Danina was implemented in a manner incompatible with the law.
It also ordered the suspension of the application of the tax until the end of its analysis by the officers in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The EU Court's decision on the way to recover tax, but it did not end the matter.
On 24 July, the Commission made a revocation in the Tribunal of Justice.
On Thursday, the TSEU press service reported that the case is currently written in the stage where the European Commission and the Polish Government are presenting their arguments in writing.
In this case, it is not worth whether or when the oral procedure is moved, whether to listen to the parties and to the possible debate.
The need for a few to a few persons from the introduction of a revocation to the advertising of the sentence.
"That's a middle-year procedure," PAP said in the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
How do you dress the child to get baptized?
We submit a few practical solutions
Baptizing is an important importance in the life of childhood and his parents.
It is often the first opportunity in which the whole family concentrates around the child and celebrates its appearance in the world together.
It's not surprising that fresh mother and dad want their comfort to look as well on that day.
But before you take a final decision about the machine of the child, wonder if it will be worth it.
Because in the stores you can find a lot of machines that don't make a little comfort.
What, then, should we take attention?
The basic criteria for baptism clothes is the age of a child
Moreover, a few weeks were baptized in white sets and in the same beaches or big poultry.
Today, children who come to the screening are often older: a number of years older and even greater.
It's not easy to find out that so much comfort needs a little different clothes to get baptized.
It is therefore your child on the day of baptism will have 3 to 4 months, probably a holiness in the car or in the hands of parents or baptized ones.
The best outcome will be shown to this equipment in admissible, battled sleeps or completes.
Although this element of the garden is recognised to be strictly daily, it is enough to search for its holiday warrants, for example with a falbank or a coron.
For the perfect boy, points will be shown with the pressure of the mouse and the sweet.
In the case of older children, you can be allowed to be more fancy in the morning.
The girl's gonna look nice in a simple, tiulish sucking
Many parents with appealing girls look at the side of rich, falsified battles for baptism in a complete with babies, bags, and bottles.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers for their product applies to plastic, increasing materials in which the child is simply inappropriate.
In searching for a suitable clothing, you will better look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant machines on battled undershells.
Delicate, tiulish bathrooms, saty-coats, corners, and splendid completes will make your bowl look pretty and feel comfortable.
Perfect site for a gentleman: Babylonian garniture
Moreover, among the parents of the boys, a model was dominated by a copy of the "adult" models.
Polyester mariners and below, steady collars or caskets often showed the young electants soundly their disappointment.
Fortunately today, they have been released by a good, battled full.
It looks at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, whether white, dressing coins, and to this blue bleeded out of front to the model of a stomach.
These machines look awesomely, and at the same time they do not break the moves of a small world.
Christian Pavlović published a statement of property
Christin Pavlovic made a statement of property to the end of the mandate.
It shows that PiS's lawyer has gathered 110 thousand bad reserves.
Remember that Paul's claimed to get out of the policy.
At the end of the mandate, the amount of 110 thousand
As a result of the declaration from the sentence, it receives the emissy about me values of 4.7000.
The Pawlovic has a apartment of 570 thousand evils and a little less than it is, getting 880 evils in the meantime.

Earlier the property statement also published Jaroslav Kakinski.
Voice over breaks in proceedings for the time of the Conservative Party
The British parliamentaries voted against a three-day interruption in the Gmin Easter for the time of the Conservative Party's program, which the Government was dealt with.
289 members were declared against - 306.
Normally, the Isba Gmin does not operate at the time of the party so that they do not have to refuse or participate in them or from Parliament's meetings.
However, the opposite parties believed that Parliament should not interrupt the debate in such a key time as the last weeks before planning on 31 October of the United Kingdom outcome from the European Union.
At the proposal of the Government, 289 members were presented, contrary to 306.
Two opposition parties already after conventions
No consent to break may be taken as a political compensation for opposition to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for weeks (the decision was recognised by the Court of Justice as incompatible with the law and non-conformity) and because after the judgment of the judges he does not want to apologize for it.
After this decision, Isba Gmin renewed the middle of the session, and the most important issue of the day was Johnson's occurrence and the following burst debate.
Johnson's opposition to the blocking of brexit and unity of pre-terminal choices.
“The time has come to perform brexit.
You need to perform it to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit must expect us to take care of the agreement on citizens' priorities, health service, life costs.
Brexit must be implemented so we can unit this country," Johnson said.
The Conservative Party's Conference is to be held in Manchester on the next Sunday and to be held to Wednesday 2 October.
Conferences of two main groups of opposition – the Working Party and Liberal Democrats – have already occurred.
One of the justifications that Johnson gave by explaining the so long suspension of the parliament was just partial.
Media: Andrej Duda charges Israel for anthemical attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anthemical attacks in Poland are a reaction to the antipolary retory of Israel's leaders," writes foreign media.
The Chairman's chairman deceived these conclusions.
"It's just not true," he replied on Twitter Blanker Spikalski.
Israeli media, namely "Haretz" and "Jerusalem Post", calling on "Jewish Insider", says that Andréy Duda during meeting the representatives of the Jewish diaspore at the RP consulate in New York stated that this Israel was guilty of the last antichemical attacks in Poland.
The president said that the growth of antisemic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the antipolary retory of Rael's leaders.
The Israeli foreign minister Katz, who said in February that “The Poland had exhibited anantiemity with mother's milk”.
Andréy Duda said that he was saying that Israel did not apologize for the disappointing statements of his politicians.
He also mentioned the act of agression against the Polish ambassador in Israel of the Magie Mark.
In May, an attacker attacked him, who cried "Polac, Polac".
“Citting is not only inaccurate.
"It's just wrong," he replied on Twitter the Blanker Spikalski.
He underlined that Duda "never said that Israel was responsible for the last antichemical attacks in Poland."
The Spychal Portal said that he invented it.
According to the "JI" speakers during the meeting, there was also a dispute between the rest of Holocaust, designed by the Commander's Order of Devotion of RP Edward Mosberg and the Shuley Boteach rabin.
Mosberg had to agree with the words of president Dudy and to say that these were the Jews of Israel "like Israel Kac" responsible for the growth of anti-emityism.
According to the source of Boteach port, Mosberg's statement had been interrupted.
Who's Banash, and what's he committed?
The compensed by the suteners of the rocks led a journalist to discover disappointments in the wealthy statements of Marian Banasia.
Let's consider another matter that hits the rulers of the camp.
The TVN journalists revealed that Marian Banas, president of the Most High Control, has not entered in the last years a 400-metric stone statement that is located on the underground Mountain.
Moreover, his employer had in the mentioned rock of sexbiznes (and thus rent rooms for hours).
In addition, the building itself has been said since 2016 by the security of the credit payment.
The Bertold Kittel reported wrongly in the program "Superviser".
The journalist revealed that from Banasia, people associated with a criminal world were able to deal with it as a “erotic meeting”.
The customers were supposed to be men using prostitute services.
The Banash's arrests answered unclearly and sadly.
What interestingly, the rock's susteners caused a journalist to discover disappointments in the Banasia property statements.
The rock itself was described in them insanely, and the income from her remuneration would be decreased.
“The owner of Marian Banasia and his value may be from 6 to 8 million evil.
In summary, married couples can praise two houses, three apartments, awards[...]," says Money.pl.
And as it results from the port analysis, the same Banasia stone was worth it was already 3 million evil.
The Central Anti-Coruption Office is currently controlling the property statements of Marian Banasia for 2015-2019.
Banash said that until it was finished, he would stop his activity in N°. "I'll come to you a march of free time," he said.
The opposition is to be explained.

Therefore, we are forced to deal with the authorities of the State and evil for the possibility of committing crime [...],” said the POS-KO Marius Witczak.
"If the normal Polak so lowly appreciates the payment of his inevitability, it would have already 10 controls, tax premiums and carni-carb practices," he added.

"Pleasepolite": Ignoring the order of the police will be punished
As the newspaper states, the decline of the order of a specific behaviour issued by the police must be a new type of exhaustity, dangerous heat, arrest or restriction of freedom.
This change will be made by political associators.
The idea took place in the Committee on Petition Affairs.
"The matter is important because it is now over half a million cases every year to the courts," we read.
The "Pleasepolite" has determined that the Petition which the independent Policies' Liaison writes to the members on the change of the exhaust code has a chance to succeed.
Petition authors shall propose a new text of Article 54a of the Code of exhausts.
He should be saying: “Whoever does not be subject to the request or order of the public officer issued in the borders and under the law shall be charged by the arrest, injury or restriction of freedom.”
"Participation 3 of this Regulation refers to the same penalty for those who do not exercise orders, prevent or harder the performance of the service," shall give the journal.
Sociolog Andrzej Kowalski said "Respopolite" that, despite the main transmission of a legislation proposal, it is afraid that if it is implemented, it can be learned in political manifestations.
"In the situations of freedom demonstrations it would be a little ambiguous and rather than a lack of the situation, it would be warned," he adds.
The statistics provided by the newspaper show that 86% of the citizens were positively evaluated by police interventions in 2018 and that they were taking 1,5 million of interventions in the city each month.
Buras cares about Europe
Yachym Topol writes in the blood.
Among his forefathers, there are editors, writers.
Father, Joseph Topol, was one of the most warrior dramatics of cze, mentioned in one row with Václave Havlem.
So over Jachim, from the beginning, the curse of the talent that he tries to learn.
After eight years, he returned with the "Freeful Man".
The heroes are Buras and Sonya together with two sons, but they are not a typical Czech family.
They're actors, they're traveling to Europe.
He's a loversman of Szekspir and a loversman, she's a single one-sheet, which doesn't stand up with a wine bottle.
One of the boys from birth did not give a sound from himself, and for the other time, he stayed in the time of young ones.
But not the heroes are the most important in this story.
All of them are just the background of the world in which there is no place for artificial coppers.
It's the world of an inflammated provincy, the coherence of old, suspicious people, and the developing youth.
"Frequent man" is replaced by an absurd theatre.
Narration imitates the didascalia, and the talks of heroes create this world.
The scene of Europe is full of anxiety about its future, but also on constant issues of the past.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for opinion
Free accommodation in exchange of opinions – such a great offer prepared for the arrival of German Görlitz.
Actions must be helped in combating the decreasing number of citizens.
It's the most thrown to the east city of Germany.
A nice pasteli shepherd brings 140 thousand tours annually.
However, as the Guardian writes, the city is overwhelmed with significant problems.
In Görlitz there are the lowest places in Germany.
The city is also winning with the constant number of residents.
After the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, most of them went to the west of the country, which was transferred to the population of the city of 25 per cent.
In 2013, it was 54,000 people.
In order to fight the deeperation, the officers fell into the idea to start offering free free of charges in the city.
Until 150 proposals have been affected.
Two thirds of them laid down the inhabitants of great cities.
The programme also was interested in persons from Hungary, Czech, the United States and the United States.
"When we applied, we thought the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the participants of the project.
"Now we feel that it doesn't matter whether we will stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven free residents, and the unemployment is three times than the average in the whole country.
Although the citizen authorities hope that some of them will take place, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the opinion of the participants.
The information collected from outputs and officers should help to live in smaller German cities.
"We want to learn more about what people need and decide to carry out -- what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild responsible for the program.
Other cities have already experimented with the ideas of retreating new inhabitants, offering them encouragement in the form of accommodation.
The first of them was Detroit, who introduced a program for the promising young specialists for life and work in the city for a year.
Today, these are solved in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candel, Italy, or in the American Tulls in Oklahoma.
