Why are we moving?
Why didn't you get me?
Why would you get me?

What will one finally help or no?
The foot is running.
The foot is crying.
Work to the Dandale.

You can't do that without me.
You can't do that without me.
You're gonna be fine to get back.
You'll be fine to get back.
It's gonna be good for you to go home soon.
You're not doing anything but eating.
You have to describe this.
You have to report this.
You have the right to think.
It's not good for you.
You're so cool.
You're so cool.
You're a polytheist.
You're the leader.
You're kidding.
You're moving.
Think I'm loved with Mary.
You tried.
You've been trying.
I thought you'd wait.
I thought you would wait.
