Two men in China and the area ended their lives with suicide
Earlier, one of the increased has already been attempted to suid.
On 30 October, approximately 1-00, in the village of Lugo on its residence in 1947, a man committed suicide by increasing.
It is known that he has already committed an attempt to be done before.
That moved a man into such a step isn't.
31 October, on 11 to 50, a 41-year-old inhabitant of China ended with life.
The signs of the mortal death are not found, reports the press service of the MO MVD " Chinese".
You got a black box in your car?
As the American road designers are trying to find money for the repair of the sex travel system, many begin to see a solution in a small black box that is accurately equipped on the box of your car.
These devices following each passed car and transmitting this information to the operators are in the centre of the attempt to modernise the older American car magazine system, adopted by Washington and the State's planning authorities.
Normally, the nice planning planning aren has unexpectedly generated intensive debates and color allians.
Liberians joined the environmental groups to lobby the Government's right to use small boxes to monitor the number of miles you passed and may even where you passed them, and then use this information to make tax accounts.
Moving the cheese in a shock.
The American Civil Freedom Union is also deeply peaceful and raised a number of issues of private life.
Although the assembly is not yet able to agree, continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They think about how they can go to the system during the decades where the drivers are going for each milk of the way they are walking.
Thousands of cars have already tested these black boxes, parts of which have a satellite follow-up.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not the question we may have the right to choose”, said Hasan Ihrat, the Executive Director of the Association of the Government of South California, who will prepare plans for the beginning of the follow-up of the authorities of the state of miles passed by each California car by 2025.
It will change how we will make these taxes.
Technology is already available for this.
This requirement is decreased by the absence of funds in the Governing Fund for the Construction of Session Roads on account of taxes that the Americans will carry out.
The Americans haven't buyed so much benzine as before.
There are more than one miles per gallon.
The federal tax, 18,4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Policies do not want to increase the tax to one center at high gas prices.
“Bengine tax is just not able to keep”, said Le Mannic, a transport policy expert at the Minnesota University.
Its state has recently been installed in a car of 500 follow-up devices for the testing of the error payment system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long-term period,” he said.
It's called the misuse of the user.
It is not surprising that this idea is attractive to urban liberals, since taxes can change the nature of poetry to reduce the risk of road and gas emissions, for example.
The planning bodies in California are ongoing to this system to achieve the objective indicators established by both the laws of this State on global heating.
However, a member of the hall of the representatives of Bill Schuster (resp, Pen ́vano), the chairman of the Road Transport Committee, said that he also considers this system as the most long-term alternative.
Reason's free market committees are also aware of the fact that the drivers will make each miles.
"This is not just a tax that will go into the black duck," said Edrian Moore, Vice-President on Political Affairs Reason.
People will be directly responsible for what they receive.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who invited the assembly to move in 2011 to a mistake payment.
The U.S. Senate approved a pilot project last year with a value of $90 million, which would participate in approximately $10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the hall of the representatives rejected this proposal because of the threats of agricultural legislators representing electors who are often going a lot of miles throughout their lives to come to the city or to the city.
A number of states and cities, however, are on this way self-sustained.
The largest enthusiasm is shown in the Oregon State, where 5000 leaders are attached to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon have a mile of running in the position of benzine tax.
The Nevada pilot project is already finished.
It's in New York.
Illinois will test it on the basis of car rental cars.
A coalition of I-95, in which transport departments include 17 states of Eastern Life (including Maryland, Penevania, Virginia and Florida), examines how they can make these changes.
This concept has not received a general recognition.
In Nevada, where approximately 50 cars of volunteers were recently established by these devices, the drivers were concerned that the Government could follow each of their steps.
"The "great brother ' s and such things are a big problem," said Alaudin Han, which addresses issues and management of efficiency in the Nevada Department of Transport.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the trials were completed, the United States Civil Freedom Union in Nevada warned on its website: “There will be unfortunately converting these devices into full-scale monitoring equipment.”
There is no need to create a huge and sound technological infrastructure, which will uncertainly be extended to keep the records on all-day movements of citizens.
Nevada is one of several states in which difficult searches for unfair technology that would allow the authorities to take account of the cars passed by miles, but without information about time and time.
If you can do that, Hann said, the society will feel more calm.
The search of this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
In particular, this company did not take place in the State tax collection.
She tried to go on the developing market of the type of auto-assurance, where the drivers would run on the basis of the running market.
However, the devices it tested took the way of designers because they did not use GPS and provided a periodic number of information threatened by the modem.
"The people will be more inclinated to do this if you don't follow their speed and do not follow their location," said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
There were some big errors in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much less dear and less decent ways to do this.
The designers in the Oregon have experimented with the delivery of the leaders of various options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can absolutely reject the device by decided to set a fixed collection on the basis of a average of miles that all of the people of the state passed.
In other places, it is hoped to sell the idea of a careful public by making devices more than less.
In New York, transport facilities are trying to repeat a taxable device that will also take the payment for parking accounts, provide “payments as you go” to the insurance and collect a bill of speed data in real time from other drivers, which the carriers could use to escape.
“The automotives will contribute to the participation of the benefit they will offer”, states the draft design document.
The designers of transport systems, however, are concerned about whether all of the mistakes are being paid only by a huge decline factor.
In the City Transport Commission on the San Francisco Ocean, the Congress could be very simple to overcome the conviction of the Concerning Fund for the Construction of Sea Roads by raising benzine taxes.
An additional simultaneous or annual tax could be taken from hybrid car drivers and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of benzine to make their fair part.
"No need for a radical surgery to be involved when everything you need to do is accepting aspirine," said Randy Rentschler, director of the legislative and public committee.
If we do this, hundreds of million of leaders will be concerned about their private life and other things.
The EU will prepare measures to support Ukraine for the economic pressure of Russia
The Union has a reserve plan for Ukraine to ensure gas as well as to achieve an agreement with the VAT on external credit if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of the EU and Ukraine Association Agreement at the Wilnis Same.
The MVF has negotiated standby credit, and another EU factor, directly participating in negotiations, has added that it is their objective to conclude an agreement in the nearby time.
In addition to the potential credit from the Ucraine MVF, 610 million can be obtained from its own union.
Analysis requested Reiter doubts that Ukraine and MVF are able to overcome old divisions on conditions.
It does not believe the possibility of reforms for help, and the International Rating Agency S&P, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign assessment on Wednesday at one degree - to "V" with "V".
However, EU representatives say that the MFI can demonstrate liquidity under creditation conditions, taking into account Ukraine's circumstances.
Furthermore, the EU's financial support plan has a reserve option to ensure Ukraine with gas, which is a deteriorating part of the supply now and from Russia.
It may be a gas from the North River or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to the factors, is the most acceptable and most acceptable way if Russia is "isolated" Ukraine.
Analytics believe that such reverse provisions for Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and that will probably lead to decreasing supply in other regions.
"The EU and the Ukrainian countries are negotiated on how to create good conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," added Reiter source.
Russia without fighting for the pollution of cities by cars
The attempts to solve major urban transport problems were observed in most world megapolis from the second half of the century.
It was usually about their reinstallation and enlargement of the magazines, or about the attempts to reduce the question on the cars, the number of cars and the time of their use.
It is a wide example of Singapore, where a severe quantification of the number of private cars has been introduced, and the right to acquisition is purchased on auktions.
His price may exceed the price of the car itself two-three times.
Other cities, including London, were introduced to the centre of the city.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgarte, the so-called green areas are introduced where only car rents are allowed with a certain ecoclass that also uses high quality of fuel (including biocarbon or electricity).
The Peking Environment Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 the "five-year pure air plan" of approximately 250 billion Juan (approximately $40 billion).
As the " E" Director for Transport pollution of the Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau of Pekina Li Consheng said, the main objective of five years is to reduce air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent to 2017, the amount of private cars to the level of not exceeding 6 million (at the same time 5,2 million), and the increase of more than 5 per cent of the use of fuel in one vehicle.
According to the Agency, car transport to Peking is now responsible for 22.5% of the general air pollution.
Including the main measures of the programme, the use of car transport and the introduction of additional taxes for auto-owners.
Furthermore, the urban "green-five-year-old" measures include, in comparison with the rest of the country, the transition to fuel standards, the introduction of the ecostandar system and the marking of cars and fuel, the entry into the central part of the city, prohibiting the use of old vehicles (including the establishment of the promoting financial programmes of old car replacement to hybrid or electricity), the development of electricity (including public and service), the development of public transport (including high capacity).
In addition to the Peking car innovations, it is also prohibited for all private cars to move in the fifth car ring (all in the CNA capital of their six) one day a week (the relevant information contains in the number of vehicle mark), as well as the issue of registration marks for cars based on lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery action, the total number of registered vehicles in Peking was only a third of the 2010.
According to the " Environmental Protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 138).
According to Min Natura, in 2011, 41 per cent of all urban pollutant emissions came to the "previous sources" in the city atmosphere.
In Moscow, for example, car emissions are ten times higher than industries, and in Saint Petersburg, nine times.
The RFs still begin to think about the possibilities of car management in towns.
The Director of the Institute for Transport and Transport Policy of the U.S.A. Michail Blinkin believes that administrative and physical measures aimed at pressing the question on the cars - the case is not able to be adopted by the society only in the case of their fullest universality.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its car park, where two classmates are sensitive to any regulatory effects - the workers and persons of the car, as well as the "privileged" users, whose total number is at least 200 thousand (approximately 5 per cent of the total number of the Moscow car park).
In the days of the ECOM center, the Urbanists in Sankt Petersburg have prepared an examination of the balance of urban territory between residence, road covering areas and transport quantities.
Basic findings of researchers: the city centre provides roads twice less than required, and the majority of the cars in the centre do not use cars every day, remaining at the long time on parkings or only on the y.
Consequently, it is not to build parkings, but to enlarge car stocks, but to reduce the traveling part (to make the streets more friendly to travel) and to use and allocation of personal transport within the territory of the historical centre (a total of 3212 ga, covering a number of central areas of the city).
The ships for non-sessioned trade in Vollogda will grow once
The urban authorities believe that the increase in the size of the streams will help to set up a range in Vollogde and free the streets from natural palaces and bottles.
The majority of customers will not have taxes, and the production they have, often, is not a relevant sanitary control.
And that means that the health is threatened.
Yes, the lower range of travel for citizens for non-sanstioned trade from November increases six times from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, reporting the press service of the Government of Volgoda.
Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned about risks for the main economic growth driver in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily the crisis of unpayed consumer credits and mass reductions.
Our main concern now is not that growth has been quiet, but the structure of this growth.
Recently, he has been fully conscious of consumption that almost doesn't deal with traffic," said the main Goldman Sachs in Russia Clemens Grafe, representing a quarter report on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal growth of payments in Russia is about 10%.
When inflation is 6%, it will be able to ensure the future consumer question at the current level, expected by Goldman Sachs.
But the rentality of Russian companies falls, so mostly, they will take care of the optimization of staff costs.
Today, we see a growth of payments in the PIB: if payments are 10%, the PIB is only 2%, explained by Mr. Grafe.
Companys have decreased rentality.
If it does not grow, it can lead to freedom and growth.
Unable to raise the payment of the Russian business, comments on the main economy Barclays Capital in Russia and SNG Vladimir Pantushin.
Without a close to historical minimums, the competition for architects is high.
In order to overcome or maintain the currents, the robotes need to take the payments.
The need in Russia is also a very rapid growth of the use.
Mr. Grafe considers that because of extremely high consumer rates for multiplying effects on the country's economy, this type of credit is not providing.
"We haven't seen the benefits of the economy from the growth of the consumption, the money is not divided by the economy, but return to the same banks in the form of percentages," said the economy.
But the other problem is Goldman Sachs expects an increase in unsecure credits.
They are primarily taken by non-profit people who have nothing to provide for them.
The values are higher than that.
As a consequence, they are not often returning," Mr. Grafe said.
Thus, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is the crisis of unpayed credits.
Director of the United States Bank Institute Basiley Slowkov has already seen the signs of a revealing bank crisis.
Small credit organisations, without access to the depth resources of the hosts, have been forced to attach the population funds under high percentages.
In response to the war troop, the masters went out and started to decrease credit rates - the economicist continues.
Small credit organisations may not exempt interests under the same rate, otherwise they will have negative percentage margins.
If the ladies don't reject the demp, Russia's threatening the valuable bank crisis, the Basiley Slowkov.
A number of bank licences in the last weeks is considered a predictor of mass destruction.
"The ladies with such a situation will not be carried out: the system of contribution insurance was not initially calculated on the system crisis," warns the head of the Institute.
But the growth of consumption will be quiet and without the crisis of non-payment, the investment bank, because of the refusal of indexing the payments of hosts and military persons found in the current version of the budget project.
A part of consumption attack will be mixed by the frog of natural monopolies (and, as a result, reduction of inflation).
But only partly: if investment is not growing (and the preference to this is not yet aid), the growth of consumption will still be quiet, trusted in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushin from Barclays Capital has not yet seen a preferential for the creation of pessimist scenarios.
"The main risk is still the price falling on oil," he says.
According to its assessment, the Russian economy will begin to reduce the value of oil under $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the BC could not be able to reduce the rate of the economy.
Pairs are observed: Inflation has decreased and banks have started to increase rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the BC who announced the transition to the inflation marketing," Clemens Grafe said.
The percentage of the Central Bank's market rates policy does not affect only interbank credit rates.
"For the CB it's the debt of all hopes," Clemens Grafe assessed.
Finances receipt by CBs are not used for economy credit, but for the management of their liquidity
As soon as the rate is decreased, the currency changes the currency, it means that the means are trying to go to speculation against the rubber.
"Rano or slowly the BC will realize that this is not working," Mr. Grafe said and once he said that the State plans to put the rubble into the "free floor" until the end of 2015.
But it should be done before, or to raise the BC key rate (5.5 per cent), he considers.
According to his assessment, the rate of the rubber is now experienced by 10%.
I'm just running one road -- it's the result of an expert.
But if the NCB is injury to the existence of a shadow of doubt that the liquidation of the currency is not a part of the weakness policy, it can cause a lot more to disturb the rubble.
In Chelabinske, the second department of the South Ural people passed.
The Forum is aware of the day of the United Nations, the 400-year rebuilding of the Russian State and the 20-year adoption of the Russian Constitution.
A delegation from all cities and areas, representatives of national-cultural unions, religious conferences, legal and executive authorities, was a total of approximately 350 people.
The Kurs for is aimed at strengthening the international agreement.
We can show an example not only to other regions but also to other countries.
We don't have divorce and divergence.
We live in full understanding, "affirms the Feo, mytropolating Chelabinski and Zlatoustowski.
A number of issues, including patriotism education, cultural cooperation, were discussed at the meeting.
After that, they adopted a resolution.
The Neoph part of the forum continued in the theater of operation and ballet.
There was an exhibition of national and cultural units in the Chelabin area.
Snowden will be ready to cooperate with Germany on the issue of the United States Research
Edward Snowden, the U.S. investigator, stated that he was ready to go to Berlin to give a witness to the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and his Director Kit Alexander were not able to answer questions about its activities.
The German Deputy Hans-Christ Struble met Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was delivered a refuge to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, who was deputed by the MMI in Berlin on Friday, stated: “Although the result of my efforts was clearly local, my Government continues to make a difference as to change and seeks to criminalize political statements by voting claims without any protection. ”
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could be convinced by the Government of the United States to reject voting accusations against him.
The accusations submitted by the Ministry of the United States of Justice included spionage and stealing of public property.
Hans-Peter Fridrich, Minister for the Internal Affairs of Germany, reported the Time Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officers, we will find ways to make this →."
The relations between the United States and Germany have been stressed after the fact that the NCB had heard the phone of the Officer of the Angel Mercel.
The Deputy Thomas Opperman, who is the deputy of a parliamentary group, who is in the puzzle, said that if there is an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, "without prejudice to his dangers and not to disrupt the United States" it should be used.
Mr. Schröbel, deputy of the Green German Party, repeated his graphy with Mr. Snowden in his Twier.
During his visit to Russia, he was conducted by two German journalists.
Mr. Struble said that Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he had gone.
If Mr. Snowden had witnessed in Germany, he would need to ensure that he would be "in safe" there, said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden in his letter said that he had met the "very and continuous" persecution campaign that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was inspired by a worldwide reaction to his "political statements".
Citizens around the world, as well as highly established operators, including in the United States, have covered the disturbance of the uncontrolled system of all-progressive follow-up of society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will take a handsheet
Frontier Airlines plans to take from passengers up to $100 because they are carrying a hand station on the board of their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start taking up $100 for a hand and $2 for a coffee or gas, although their statement in the middle stated that passengers are going to leave the whole bank.
The new payment for the hand was distributed to the bags in the baggage areas, so the small bottles located under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said he would take $25 if the collection was paid before, and $100, if the travellers would be able only to get out of the station.
Representative of the Frontier Kate O'Melley said that the payment for $100 had to make passengers care about payment before.
"We don't want to take this for," she said.
The Aviation Company began to take the first and second bag in the baggage in 2008.
Passagers trying to escape these assemblies buy as many figs in the hands of the bathroom, which often does not have enough places in these divisions.
The assemblies are one of the ways to make passengers less on board.
O'Melley said that this new collection wasn't actually for money.
The fact is that the most loyal is that the Frontier clients claim that finding a place in the baggage sections becomes more difficult.
Passagers who buy tickets on the aircraft site shall not be held.
This means that a passenger in the railway of Frontier can get the opportunity to carry the bag free, while the passenger in order to pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Melley said that the change of procedures on the website and on the staff of the Frontier register was invited to ensure that passengers would know about the collection before they would come out of the station.
The new Frontier assembly will not start taking up until the summer, although the date is not yet established.
Passagers often complain about the baggage and other assemblies, but the aircraft are worshipping them.
They acknowledge that the baggage costs money, and the passengers who need this service should pay it.
Many in Wall Street consider the adding of baggage collections that the aircraft will take enough money to cover airport costs after several years of delay.
Yet, most of them did not pack the assemblies for the hands.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection for three years ago, and another Allegiant Air was following her example later.
The only other aircraft company with this collection is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said Jay Sorensen Aviation Adviser, who carefully follows additional collections.
According to its evaluation in the report from December 2011, the assembly for the hands of the Spirit offers $50 million per year.
Sorenssen, the former Midwest Airlines top manager, was recently flying by the Spirit's flight, and he was interesting that he would find out at the outcome of the station when passengers met the outstanding assembly of the Spirit at the hand.
He said, "The process of planting was the fairest of those I saw for my career in the aircraft," he said.
I expected to see the teeth crossing and a drama at the outside of the station.
The plane was filled, he said, "and the place has passed straight."
Frontier is also responsible for the Spirit for $2 for coffee, tea, gas or socket.
Frontier said that passengers who receive gas or sugar can leave the whole bank and that the cafe debt will be provided freely.
She will still split water freely.
US Airways tried to take a drink for a long time in 2008, but from that after seven months after the passengers began to complain, and no other major aircraft has followed her example.
The Frontier's initiative is to take hands when passengers do not buy tickets directly in the aircraft, and it is following the measurement of customers on their website.
Aeroplanes have a online seller of tickets, such as Orbitz, $10 to $25 for each sale ticket.
This has encouraged all aircraft companies to encourage passengers to buy tickets in their interests, not to address to the online tourist.
However, the frontier went further to all in this area.
In September, she began giving two times less bonus miles of flight passengers to customers who bought tickets through the online tourist agency.
In the middle of the mile, it cut the premium number of miles to 25 per cent of the miles of driving.
Yes, the driving of 1000 miles from the Frontier, obtained by the online tourist of the Agency, would allow 250 miles.
Moreover, passengers can choose a place before if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has the base of loyal customers in Denver's family, but her business is reduced and becomes adequate.
The departure was decreased by 9 per cent, and the summer opportunities were reduced by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, the financial results of the Republic Airways Holdings Inc in the middle of the parent company.
The Republic is trying to correct the frontiers in the field of the aircraft sale.
NCB is responsible for internal error, not for hackers to stop the site's work
The Occupied Secret Agency of National Security stated on Friday evening that the interruption of their website for a few hours was caused by a technical conflict, not by hackers, as stated on the network.
“NSA.gov was not available during a few hours tonight because of an internal error occurred during the planning update”, reported the reporting agency in the Official E-mail.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The statement that the death in the defence was caused by a divisioned attack of the type “reject in service” [DDoS] is invalid.
Earlier tonight, server monitoring systems registered that the NBS site was not working at least six hours, and the site is still not available for some users.
ABC News reported earlier that the internal secret network of the Agency has been broken.
No secreted information is in danger, reported by the representative.
At least one online group of hackers claimed that it was responsible for the construction of the NBS site using DDOS attack.
The DDoS attacks are multiplied in order to reduce the target site's traffic until the servers are surrounded and the site is not out of the building.
Hacker tactics are simple and attacks are not intended to enter the internal target system.
The previous supersecret NBs, which had ever received the "Not-Agency", have been in the past months in the public attention centre and criticism after the revelation of its large monitoring programmes on round and within the country, all this is the reaction to secret NB files stolen by the Agency and the disappointed by the former NB Edward Snowden.
The growing area around the Agency has so much caused that the present incident was the result of the targeted hackers.
Bombardier's arrival is decreased with the fall of supplies and the number of orders on the plane
Bombardier, the Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported on Thursday, 15 per cent of the decreased number of airports and aircraft supplies in the third quarter and the problems with contracts in its railway division.
Bombardier, located in Montreal, also did not repeat any data on the summer tests of its newest CSeries aircraft and not for new information about whether both plans for the introduction of the aircraft to the commercial operation would be carried out to September.
After the first flight of the experienced aircraft model, about half months ago, he was only three times awaiting questions about whether the stage of tests on the graphics.
Results have not justified the forecasts and have led more than 8 per cent of action on the Toronto Foundation.
Cameroon Doerxen, the National Bank Financial analysis, reduced its head from the "medium market" to the "medium-year market" on Wednesday because of the conviction that the growth of the shares is in the nearest quarter or two.
“Although the reduction of the air supply was totally predicted, we have certainly been disappointed by the indicators of transport”, Doerxen said in the consideration of the fund market.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders on CSeries as long as the annual test programme continues.
However, if no new orders are stated in the next months, we assume that the market will be more skeptic to the programme.
Bombardier's company hopes that CSeries' aeroplane family will allow her to win a place at the lower price of the market, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first experienced model of the aircraft was presented in March and the first time the flight was made in September after a few months of delay.
However, firm CSeries orders are not too much to 177, since the purchasers' capacity are waiting for the results of annual trials to verify the company's fuel efficiency and potential economicity of the new layer.
There are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
The Master Executive Director Peter Boduan was convinced that Bombardier would set up its goal in 300 firm orders until the first airplane was launched in the commercial exploit.
On Thursday, the analysers and MMI also assured that the programme was being moved forward.
“The aircraft test model was not longer on the ground than expected”, said Boduan during the phone conference, adding that earthly tests and software updates were planned during the simple airplane.
All producers are planning tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and break up the update, so we did.
This will take place during the whole programme of annual trials.
The second of the five test patterns must fly in the next weeks, and the rest of them will follow it, as the company has reported.
Nevertheless, the analyses are scrutinously related to the statement that the first client would be able to access CSeries' aircraft within 12 months after its first flight.
The Bombardier company stated that it would evaluate the time of the operation and provide new information for a few months.
"This slow level of annual trials - at least, of course, and corresponds to the internal graph of Bombardier - supports the view that the introduction into the exploit will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerxen.
In the third quarter, on 30 September, the clean income of Bombardier decreased up to $147 million, or $8 per action, with $172 million, or 9 cents per action, last year.
The corrected income for the action remained 9 cents older.
The wave income was shortly reduced from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysis expected 10 cents for a share and $4.56 billion income, which is Thomson Re日s I/B/E/S.
The fourth worldwide aircraft producer reported that he was at 45 aircraft vessels for a quarter that was less than 57 in the previous year.
The total number of orders has fallen from 83 to 26 aircrafts.
The portfolio of the aircraft was $32.9 billion to 30 September without change from 31 December.
"The results in the aircraft were in line with our objectives, but the small number of commitments and the common market conditions became an inappropriate factor," Boduan said.
The aircraft income has fallen by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train producer, reported that the income in this sector increased by almost 11 per cent to $2,1 billion.
Portfolio of orders in the transport division from $32.6 billion to 30 September, which is a little higher than 31 December.
The income of the transport division was negative in the implementation of several major contracts.
The Rue stated that in the fourth quarter, a new development plan would be presented.
Bombardier's actions, which also announced that the Chief Financial Director of the Corporation of Google Patrick Piczet's Board, has 8.5 per cent up to $4.83 on trades in the midst of Thursday.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the third worldwide commercial aircraft producer and the closer competitor Bombardier, reported on a decrease of 10 per cent of the quarter income on Thursday.
Sony calculates a lower annual revenue
The Japanese electricity producer, Sony's corporation, completed the past quarter with a pure deficit of 19.3 billion yen, or 197 billion dollars, reduced the prognoses for the current financial year.
The results of Sony from July to September 2013 have been more satisfied than expected by the question to be made on TV, video cameras and persons of Japan's production computers.
Sony's television business, in the second quarter of the first three years of operational revenue of 5.2 billion yen, again falled to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronic market is suffering from difficult times, especially because of television decreasing.
And while competitors are trying to find out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to go on the consumer segment.
For example, one of the main opponents of Sony, Panasonic corporation, has recently made accents to industrial compliance: the sales of the company will be high temperatures, especially because of car systems and environmentally clean technologies.
As a result of the end of the financial year, which will be ended in March 2014, Sony calculates that 179 billion of operating income against the expected earlier 230 billion yen.
Thus, according to the Thomson Re§s, the analysis assumed that the indicator would be significantly higher than 221 billion yen.
In trying to get out of the crisis, Sony expands the product line.
In the middle of this month, it was announced the start of the sale of " smart" hours from the Japanese corporation assigned near modal functions that would allow to be released from the need for 100 times a day.
Once Sony had decreased the annual project on arrival and breakfast, the operations tomorrow in Tokyo lost more than 11 per cent in price, decreasing the level of 1668 Yen for one action.
Geni has been the stimulator of synapsis education
Scientists at the University of John Hopkins and the Medical School Mount-Siney found a white, which promotes Foxp2's role by stimulating the education of new relationships between neurons.
The Science study has been conducted, and its short content can be read on the site of the magazine.
Gen Foxp2 is the first gene, which is the function of which I stresse with ..
His role was successful in 2001 by finding a number of people who were unable to speak correctly and sometimes they did not even understand each other.
The scientists discovered that the family members had violated Foxp2's work, but how it works out, it was not still.
In the new study, biologists showed that at least part of their functions Foxp2 is a stimulator for the education of new brain synapses in the form of things.
It's about it by another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was found as a result of the search of factors that stimulate synapsis education.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, and Foxp2 was only responsible for its activity.
What SRPX2 really affects the vaccine, the scientists have confirmed in the muscle experiment.
When the gene was experiencedly decreased in animal activity, they cried less when divided with mother.
If gene activity was restored, the frequency of sounds was also restored.
Before the mouse has also been shown to the Foxp2 vaccination.
The animals introduced a copy of the gene were more active and less frequency than the normal mouse.
To this point, however, the scientists do not know whether Foxp2 is working and, respectively, SRPX2 is managed with clear "mechanical" sound education properties or more tone processes.
A Cocain Dependence Justice, who warned the head of the criminal group on police investigation
42-year Basharat Ditta transmitted information to the criminal authority of Nelu Scarboro
The lawyer feared that his secret drug dependence would be discovered
The Royal Court of Justice was sentenced for three years.
The prestigious one who reported to the drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid of disturbing his secret drug dependency was arrested for three years.
The 42-year Basharat Ditta transmitted secret information to the criminal authority of Nelu Scarboro on the investigation of his action on the illegal trafficking of drugs after it was threatened because of its cocaine dependence.
A lawyer who received the call of Bash and called among the criminals "criminal" was arrested in 2011 after the police office for Scarboro, which he had previously represented in the court of drugs.
The officers noted that 32-year Scarboro left three cookies with cocain at the home of Blackbern City of Lankashire, while he was at the dinner of a lawyer association with colleagues.
The consequences showed that Ditta “regu’ used” drugs of class A, after the tests showed the tracks of cocaine in his hair, on his paper and on his credit cards.
During eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information about the arrests of two persons on the order of Scarboro and one of his partners.
All four suspects were at that time monitored by the police in the framework of a large investigation of the crime organization on the loss of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Mercisade, Berkshire and Western Yorkshire.
More than 32 people were arrested later after the police had exposed heroin and cocaine in a series of raids at 1.5 million pounds and more than 2.200 000 pounds available.
42-year-old Ditta reported to criminals because of fear that his cocaine dependence would be discovered.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors' court in Blakeberne, it was covered by a disappointment after recognition of his fault in two cases of obstacle to justice in the three-week court of the Court of Liverpool.
He recognized the conservation of cocaine at one of the previous court meetings.
The lawyer's distortion occurred after the police investigating Scarboro discovered that he had regularly spoken with Ditta on the phone from February 2011.
Two children followed the suspicious and discovered how he arrived to the house of Ditta in Blackberne and placed drugs in a 60-percent cleaning in a black hole for golf under a lawyer's muscle box.
In the afterwards, Scarboro was multi-fold contacted with Ditta, who was at the dinner at the football stadium Ivud Park of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home after drugs; there were nine.
The Court recognized that Ditta had “reguly used” cocaine after the tests found in class A’s hair, bottle and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but he refused the use of cocaine, said that he spoke to the suspicious diler because he was his client, and insisted that their communication constitutes a "advocate secret".
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and he had also taken a model of wheat.
At the police interrogation, he said that he had a home office and customers at his home for legal matters.
However, the court was aware that after major arrests, he called the major parts of the illegal traffic of drugs that he had previously represented in the court to tell the child's knowledge of them.
In Anne White's accusation, he said, "If anyone knows that it is not to violate the law, it is according to the votes."
Mr. Ditta is accused of misuse of the situation of the opinion, since he has entered too close with certain customers.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug trafficker, but a drug trader who has a drug-supporting drug.
It will certainly be legal, because he was theirs.
However, this has exceeded significantly the limits of normal and customer.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible to allow this criminal activity to continue.
Mr. Ditta didn't respect his profession, but he's kidnapped her.
He was too close to certain customers, particularly Scarboro, and allowed to doubt his independence.
Ditta did not recognize the guilt and said, "If I was corrupted by the one I don't think, and I would like to send Mr. Scarboro information, I wouldn't wait for 15 hours, I would do it immediately."
But after the meeting of Lee Holsted of Lancashira's police officer, he said: "Mr. Ditta has become from the voting cases to a voting criminal as soon as he has started to obtain drugs from the organized crime representatives."
His attractiveness to cocaine has made it unexpectedly compromised and vulnerable for the main criminal groups participants who have ordered him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
The lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and provoke the society confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta delivered this confidence and tried to cover his profession.
The investigation on Mr. Ditta has led the Lancashire Department on a dangerous organized crime, which has already been sentenced to him for three cases of cocaine conservation, and now also for a prejudice to justice, demonstrating our desire to be justified for criminals.
Let this case be a warning for criminals that no one is outside the law.
We will find you and in the case of the judiciary.
Sam Scarboro was sentenced for 14 years after the recognition of his guilt in conference with the purpose of providing heroin, cocaine and marihuana.
Another 35 people who participated in immigration were sentenced to 153 years for crimes with drugs.
On his website, Ditta organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers that he said that the work of his mouths is representing customers with a ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ , ideal companion for him at dinner , Mohammed Ali , and motivation in ≥ is an inequality .
The stadium in Jaroslavla is not ready for the receipt of 22,000 spectators, noted by the police attended at the DCR RFS meeting today.

There are no groups of "Bratski Circle" groups in the MVD bases to which Lepsa has been calculated in the United States
The Russian forces databases of the Bratski Circle group, to which Washington has assigned the Grigory Leps song, does not mean.
As the Interfax was noted in the RF legal protection bodies, after reports received in the US Ministry of Finance of Gregory Leps in the suspicious suspicion of the Eurosian Criminal Criminal Syndicate, all the databases were checked, but such groups were not found.
The dissemination of this information enables the maintenance of the myth of the so-called " Russian mafia", which, as a result, is considered in power structures.
"And in the same name, 'Bratski Circle', there is a secret element, which contains a secret lie.
"All this looks very like a pear-action," said the interviewer of the Agency.

The persons listed in this list are suspicious in connection with some of the Vladislav Leontijev and Gafur Rahim, which are considered as a member of criminal groups and are in the United States sanction lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Gregory Leps "serves a curriculum for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev".
In the producer center, the Gregory Leps was refused to comment on the U.S. accusations to the song, called them "boat".
In 2011, the President of the United States of Barak Obama took the "Bratski Circle" syndicat to the number of transnational organized criminal groups and commanded the mine to "broke and deploy their global crimes".
The introduction of humans into the black American mines will be the locking of its assets in the United States and the prohibition of business contacts with those residents in the United States.

Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're studying all the options.
The priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
It doesn't just want to find any trainer, but a person who has spent a few years in our club and has a certain result with him.
The Kenya press is obliged by the Provocation Law on MMEs
“This is a place, and there are questions: what could not allow Parliament to allow the independence of the judicial system in the future?” reported the newspaper called unconstitutional law.
“This law is very severe, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Camau, director of Capital Group, the Main Company of CapitalFM, which includes one of the most considered in Kenya independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new Court of Justice on Mass Information Resources “always will be admissible because it is a continuation of the Government” and that the contingency and advertising on the position of Kenya in the global economy.
"I hope that the President listens to us, and we ask him to reject this legislative project and return it to the deputats," he said.
According to The Star, the new law would actually allow the Government to "take a dead mixture" and The Standard reported that the democracy and the freedom of words in Kenya were "severely hit" and that the law was discorted as "draconic".
The adoption of the legislative project is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security after the attack of the Muslim terrorists in the Westgate trade center.
The Kenia SMEs have provoked the wrath of the authorities by translining the records of the observation cameras where the army sent to an attack are probably struck by a road trade center.
The response of the police officer David Kimayo's two journalists and officer MMI's calls to question, although the challenge was cancelled after mass MMI protests.
In accordance with the new law of issues, up to 20 million kinesian shillings can be travelled, and individual journalists — up to one million with additional risks to be “excluding from lists”, which is the prohibition of obtaining of official journalist acreditation.
The Court also has the right to confiscate the property of the consumer if the staff is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “although one step is enough to paralyze most of the FM radio stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a disruptive effect on the so-called "life blogosphere" of Kenya.
The politicians understand that when they make the MMI quiet, they can do all that they are thinking without punishing.
“No one will never know”, wrote the journalist Nation Mutuma Matthew, characterising the Kenia SMEs as a key source of sustaining and balanced forces in public life.
“The political policy themselves will destroy the country and will return us to the delight and collection, ” he wrote.
Kenya legislators were a mix of public anger and in the past.
In May they vote for the cancellation of the decreases appointed by the National Payment Commission, and the restoration of their large payment, which consists of approximately 532 thousand shillings per month, is one of the highest world.
A new line of expenses will be found in the communal boxes - the calculation of the capital reparation of the house.

The precise rule will determine the Government of the region.
Thus, when closing the trail, bringing the stage cells in order or even replaceing the lift, the lifts themselves will be resolved.
Such law was approved by the deputats of the regional speech.

Vladimir Keycznikov, president of the Woroneva Regional Dictionary, said: "No secret that in this field, it has also been initiated a misuse that is the same as the same in the 98th year, and in the 2000th."
People began to work on this to cover the laze, including these two laws.
It was determined to build a temporary residence centre for foreign citizens who were deported.
The Regional Parliament adopted such law not only under the pressure of the Federation.
The problem with illegal migrants in the region is at least delayed.
Yes, in the past year, the migration account has become almost 100 000 foreigners.
But only every five of them had an official authorisation.
Where the rest of them are working and whether they are taxed, it is a big question.
Vladimir Keyčnikov, president of the Woroneve regional word, said, "They have violated the law, but not the criminals."
There's no court, but you need to deport, you need to contain them somewhere.
Such a decision was made by the Federation that, due to regional resources, such areas would be equipped.
It is definitely the Old Olschanka of the Semiluck area in the Woroneva.
Well, the regional parliament has recently granted a lot of loans to the parents.
First of all, families with 5 and more children are fully released from transport tax.
In this case, the budget loses 3.5 million, but the economy and many parents.
Second, and this is primarily, those who are children of 3 and less, will have been granted subsidy on jail since the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides 18 square meters, a price of 30 thousand per meter.
Family, for example, from 6 people, is dad, mother, child, and 3 children.
For them, by standards, the State obtains 108 square metres of yellow for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left or South-West microon, the option is completely acceptable.
Well, in the paradise, you can buy a whole cottage for this amount.

Italian stages with a stage of intervention for young people
The Italian without a record is running.
The average data showed that 12.5% of the country ' s people are now working without work.
Such bad things have not occurred since World War II.
This is a number of times above among youths.
40.4% of the 15-24-year-olds have no jobs.

What will lead to the TPU building in Moscow
Each year, the staff authorities promise to make more transport-transplanting nodes (ITU).
It is planned to introduce 255 TFUE until 2020.
What the draft is actually being discussed, our co-respondent was discussed.
A few months ago, the "Smolenska" metro of the Arbatic Poker Line has arisen of a construction.
The signature claimed that it was also a transport-transplanted node equipment.
All this was very strange because near Smolenska no land transport remains and thus moves on it.
In order to reach the nearest trilebus residue on the Garden ring, it is necessary to overcome 130 metres, including a land transition through the Carmanic Transfer.
Now the Smolenski is almost finished.
The flower larc, demounted stand for newspapers, and the asfalt before the entrance changed a brush.
Here's the whole transport node.
Transport-transport nodes are flat and capital, explaining in the press service of the capital department of transport.
Captains' TIPs are not yet.
A plane is expected to build parks, the outcome of trading objects mixing the movement of passengers, the creation of small textural forms and well-being.
In particular, aircraft TIPs do not even carriers, but professionals from the Department of Moscow capital reparation.
The transport node is not necessarily complicated, explains the Director of the Institute for Transport Economy and Transport Policy of the High Economy School of Michael Blinkin.
Sometimes enough coverages over the table and tables that announce the time of transport.
For example, the "Jasenevo" metro has recently been opened with a full-valued floor resettlement node.
Let it be without tissues, but with overcast parkings and tables indicating when the bus is on.
But after the number of factors, they're recording everything that's going on in the TIP.
In 2011, the measure plan was to build for all 151 hosts, 59 of them with capital building.
Plans for 2020 are now up to 255 TFUE.
A half of them are promised to give up this year.
Although there is an ITU development programme in the city, there are no quality criteria, Alexander Morozov, the chairman of the public organization of the " City and Transport".
The number of objects is reported, but the quantity of transplants on each of them is often deteriorated.
The criteria, as the expert considers, must be two: first: reduction of the time of the transplant, secondly, goodness.
First, it is possible to change the type of transport without the rain.
However, in Moscow, the TIP is at the same time in the opposite.
A light example of the "DNA".
Previous buses from the Jaroslovack Session at the square before the main entrance in the VVC.
The rest of them has now been moved to the opposite side of Jaroslavka to the Cosmonaut Street.
Further than a metro, significantly far away from a monorel, so closer to a living house.
Given that the people did not want a carvoxal under the windows and complained about all the institutions.
The TIP capitals in Moscow haven't been a problem.
The first of them began to build five years ago at the "Planna".
The project was called to be an example.
And it was actually made a pattern of how the transplanted node for the redemption of investors is converted into a banal trade center.
No, there's perrons for buses, so that they don't go from the metro under the rain, and three stages of cars.
True, the chemical trilebus No.202 and No.203 in the Moscow TIP place did not give principle.
They've been thrown away from the metro.
So there's more places under trade.
Only a garment of 32 magazine, and there are almost everything from zoots to car salon.
Well, actually, who of the bus passengers will need to buy a new car on the road?
We have, when building a capital TIP, a trade center is always obtained.
Recently, the situation has reached its conclusion log when part of the carriers decided to market.
Now, at the third stage of the TFU "Planer" among those in the parking field and the fighting trade.
Herbs, speechs, Chinese genes, neurological ships and guards, which are badly looking at our graph.
The transplanted node became a bassar.
The thing was that the Planner's metro had a market before, but it was taken down.
And in the prefecture, the trademakers were welcomed and released to a overcast park of the resettlement node.
Still, because of high prices there is always empty.
It's the most funny that the market was laid down for building a new floor TIP on it.
That's a rockery.
The "Kalujska" metro was a 50 meters of the shipbuild to the bus, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of a trade center, like TIP, the race increased up to 170 meters.
To sit in the bus, we need to go through the whole trade center.
After 22 hours when he is closed, he's going to run him under the open sky.
However, the "Planership" and "Calujian" will soon be shown by flowers.
Meanwhile, in September, the Middle-Agricultural Commission adopted planning decisions for the first eight capital TIPs.
Four of them will be 25 feet without considering two-three underground yarns.
The main monster will grow at the "Tushino" metro, in which it will be 418.7000 meters of the area.
Representatives of the RIDs of railway boxes responsible for the TPU building at the metro have already reported to journalists: stores, hotels and apartments are located in the future multiple stages.
In this context, the factors assured that multi-virus parkings are deep from the third to the half of the area.
Let's take the example of "national" garages.
For example, the garage of 258 machines, which have recently been built on the International Street, has a range of 8015 kilometers.
So, for the parking of 2.6000 cars at Petrovsko-Razomski, there will be 80,000 "quadrates".
It's less than a third of the machine that's going to be built there.
Let the stage go to the bus stage.
It remains at least 150,000 meters of commercial impairment.
And this, for a minute, is nearly two GUMs.
If TCP capital is built by railway travelers, the rest of the areas will be obtained by meterpolitans.
They also promised that there would be a lot of " functional destination objects", including guests, offices and even sports.
Moreover, in the Department of the town of Moscow's property, journalists have recently reported that they are developing a project of installation, which investors are able to address to the TIP's contribution to the operators.
No competition.
Therefore, I prayed that transport issues for the city were priority.
Perfect TIP is, for example, the Garwards in Boston or Spanina in Toronto, which is certainly Alexander Morozov.
Thrillebuses and tramways descend under the ground at the level of metro and race of metro to the tramwage, which consists of only 50 meters without the street.
There's no big trade around.
But the Moscow factors are in the end.
Or we're not going to build anything or we're going to threaten 25 stages with offices and apartments.
Eser will compare with extremism on the adjustment of patriotic feelings
In order to protect the patriotic sensitiveness of citizens from provokations against Russia and about the challenges of the " Justice of Russia" will be compared to the adherence of patriotic emotions to extremist activities and to punish it for five years.
As reported by the report, such amendments to the law prepared by the Energy Committee on the Energy Committee by Oleg Michew are already addressed to the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under patriotic feelings, the author of the amendments will understand the emotional relationship of the person with the country that he is a citizen who is a citizen who loves this country, responsible for its judgment, respect for his history and culture.
As Micheas indicates, the father's law contains sanctions on the formal signs of the State authority by the flag and herb.
In addition, as the parliamentary opinion, the protection of the Russian whose feelings may be taken into account and the existence of public symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect to our country, the Russian law on it has not been sufficient.
As an example, he brings the disturbing persons every year to the Day of Victory of Discussion, when some medical persons are allowed to doubt the heroic movement of the SSR people in the fight against fascists.
The Penalty of the Master National Festival - The Day of Victory 9 May - the actual vaccine is annually distorted.
In exercising the "alternative view" of the history, some publicists are thinking of the fact that, deceiving, the fact that cultural Germans have not gained a wild Soviet Union!
I consider that it is absolutely inappropriate in the country where the story is the main "spirital force" of the nation," Oleg Michea is forced.
Furthermore, Micah said that the patriotic people in Russia were much more than religious, but the law claimed that the feelings of those who believed and that patriotic feelings could be almost unpunished.
According to the people ' s opinion, it is necessary to compare patriotic feelings to extremist activity and to add to Article 282 of the Code of the Code.
The draft legislation provides a penalty for patriotic feelings: from 100 months to five-year conclusions.

Dmitriy Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Prime Minister RF Dmitriy Medvedev reported on Friday that Greenpeace's activists would be discussed in close terms with Russian law.
France may not doubt that the consideration of the matter will be carried out with respect to the law of the law, and we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee the follow-up of laws," said Dmitry Medvedak at the meeting with the Prime Minister of France Jean-Mark Ero.
Greenpeace is a French citizen among the detained activists.
Pieru Pizanya, as well as the rest of the activists, has been accused of injury.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quoted Mr. Ero's RIA News.
"Our country cannot support the activities that may cause environmental damage, no one can able to violate laws," said Dmitri Medvedev in its order.
It says that the activity of any structures that are trying to affect technically complex and insecure processes, including energy gain, is dangerous.
He underlined that these objects were "as a roof bottle" and once he said what happened in the Me'Can's Valve, "Ria News" translated.
The United Nations declares new objectives to overcome poverty
The United Nations should immediately reach the new complement of the Millennium Development Goals, which have been formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
The Australian diplomats played a key role in the implementation of the ‘sustainable development objective’ for the CRT exchange, which expires in 2015, until the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development started at Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final argument of the document, which will sign world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Gi Mun said to the parties of the Sammit at night that it was now time to “stay above national interests”.
“I am pleased that the United Nations Member States agreed to launch and take the process for the creation of universal sustainable development objectives,” he said.
These CURs will be based on our progress in the achievement of Millennium Development Goals, and they will become an increasing part of the development concept for the period after 2015.
I will apply all efforts to use the powers conferred by Member States to enhance our view of sustainable development objectives based on the successful implementation of the CRT.
The security care in Mozambique increases through the conflict of influenced people
Under the top of the statue of Samora Mashel, the president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to scan the world's lozing on one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want the return of the world; we want stability”, Vanessa de Susa, the Executive Director of the Investment Company, said.
In danger of the future of her country, she changed the business costume to the football, which was endorsed by the title “We require security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on the staff of independence on Thursday.
During two weeks, nearly daily reports on the meetings between the Governing Armies and Renamo were one of the worst contacts since the conclusion of the reconciliation over 20 years ago.
Renamo was sometimes a rebellious movement supported by the white authorities of Rodesia and then by the Government of the South Apartment’s Epoch in the efforts to destabilise the independent government.
After reconciliation in 1992, it became a opposition party.
Analysis believes that the country is almost going back to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have caused foreign investors and residents to be nervous.
Heights for fast growing economy, since the opening of great gas-shelf stocks and the north-western hot-western areas can be more than $50 billion investments in a few years of companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The Governing Party of Frelimo, leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party accused each other of the pressure created.
The Party of Renamo acknowledges that the Government has become the conclusion of the last meetings by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional remuneration of Renamo, 17 October.
The attacks on the rebels would then be distorted when the Governing Armies attacked the Renamo base and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakam, the leader of the group, reported the Financial Times Fernando Mazango, representative of Renamo.
The Government is guilty of Renamo at the initiation of meetings, accusing the party to attack soldiers.
The President of Armanda Hebus tried to develop concerns for instability.
Hebuza declared that the AFP, the French In-essential Agency, in the middle of Mr. Dhlakama felt "insufficient" and used "all that remained from its strength to try to prove that he could link his own decisions to the Government."
Like Frelimo and Renamo are insisting that wars want to escape.
However, fears increased after the report that Mazanga stated that Renamo was rejected by the 1992 peace agreement.
He reported the Financial Times that he had regard to the unconformity of the Party of Frelimo.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness," said Mazanga.
Previous negotiations between parties have not been made to deteriorate the stress that has increased a series of meetings this year.
“This are two influential people (Gebus and Dhlakama) who were broken by the labbas,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lector of the Open University and an expert in Mozambique.
No one of them is a good negotiator, and no one of them is willing to go to the attacks.
The Party of Renamo, who is trying to reach election reforms, has already stated that it would bowk up the elections appointed for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for the year.
The commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt to get awards and financial bonus from the Government.
The portion of the votes for Renamo is decreased since 1992, while the new party is the Democracy Mosambique movement (MDM), which is expected to improve its indicators on these elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Gabuz, who has to stay in the year of the second time, wants to continue democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multipartial democracy, he does not want transparency elections, he does not want peace because he doesn't want to leave the president's post," said Mazanga.
It is not clear to what Renamo has been able, but she has already discussed the disruptions and efforts to attack the police party and cars on the key cars leading from the north to the south.
Most of the sticks were located in the province of Sofala, a few hundred miles north of Maputo, but included the gate of Beirus, which is the port of the top-counters, including Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export an angle.
In June, Rio stopped the use of railway routes approximately a week after Renamo threatened the attack on the railway.
Mazanga was inclined when he was asked if Renama would repeat this threat.
The Partie Renamo wanted to "advertise the international community that the activities in Mozambique are not very good," said Mazanga.
Instability has strengthened the government's insufficiency, and many are also concerned about corruption, a long-term development and recently involved human relief, says Fernando Lim, head of the independent Mediacoop Media Company.
“The people think that the responsibility for the future country is the government and the president who must find the solutions of these issues,” he says.
Omar Sultuan, a demonstration party, said that people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renama or Frelimo; they just want to restore the world, they want free access to the paths," he said.
Series of Premier Films " Arth-Minestrum" in Moscow
The series of "Arth-mynstham" films where the lookers can see one Russian and four invasive films in a few days before they go out to the procate, in the Rolan cinematheater from 1 to 5 November, reports RIA "News" with the organizers of the project.
Opens the French Registry Comediation and the actors of Reim Carrici "Paris of any price".
This is a story of the worker in the French capital of the Maye model (solo Carichi), which is deported to the family - to Marokko because of the vize problem.
Besides the Carric movie, they will also show a new picture of the famous South Korean Registry Kim Ki Dock "Mebius", a melody of Oliver Hirshbigel's "Diana: Love History" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role and the main movie passed in May Cana's film "Life Adel" Abdelity Keshisha.
The only Russian part of Arth-Minstream will be the winner of the "Kinotavr" film of Alexandra Veledin's "Geography Globus" for the motives of the unnamed Roman Alexander Ivanov.
The main role of Viktor's learner's main failure was playing Constantin Habenski in the movie, whose work was also marked by the Price of Kinotowar.
Children should study myths and anniversaries as “models of life”, says the author.
The stories about Torah could show that “the grave power cannot win the deepness, ” and the ends of the King Arture have the importance of fighting.
As many myths will be “too wild, too scandal and in some cases too inappropriate for school education”, Crossley-Holland refers to the “deep selection” of texts in age.
"I think it's marvelous that in America I've already been a part of education," he said.
I expressed their introduction into the twenty-year training programme.
He added that the "reverse moralization" of the authors and teachers "seems interest" in children, and the main ideas are "complimentated" in historical stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated "Beowulf" from English-Saxon, and wrote "The Norwegian Myth Collection" for the Penguin and the British People's Stories," said, "You can certainly have any abilities, but you better keep them at your own."
It may be that a great decline between the adult author and the adult author who writes for children is needed to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy end, but it is necessary to have a long-term understanding of good and good.
And this must be sublimized; it is revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Ancient principle is to show, not to tell.
A football fanat was detained in the Woroneva area that split the window in the boxing room
On nine hours on October 29, the Transport Police of Grezy-Voronez was removed from the passenger train of two football fans, the Moscow area.
When the favorite team was played, the guys made a drink debt on the road.
Youths have been delivered to the dejure part of the lineary Police on the Greeze for the establishment of a administrative law protocol.
The fans were in their anti-communication conduct.
The police formed administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the train and at the box of the Office were waiting for its arrival.
In the middle of the first night, the employees left from the oxygen railway, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, returned unexpectedly and cut the window of the door inside in the boxing room.
On the call of the diluted glass, the transport police and the COP's guardian were running.

A check is carried out by South-Eastern Russian MVD partners.
The question is addressed on the excitation of the vote, and the senior reporter reported to the information and public relations of the South-East Russian MVD in the transport of Sergei Olhovik.
Vitalius Mutco: Water?
I think we've been back 15 years ago.
Vitalius Mutko, Minister of Justice, expressed his opinion on the wrath of the tribes during the Chubka of Russia Shinnik, "Spartak".
I am a member of the response to the organizers of events: clubs, liga, RFCs.
But we've seen that they've taken a nice place.
They're waiting for someone on the side and in order.
It's a very good position, but it's not real.
Clubs must organize sisters, and clubs should invite their stairs, rather than leave the case on their own.
We have now set up a special set of the Government on the rules of behaviour at stage.
After accepting it, we will take care of this problem.
But I'm still obliged to invite all the organizers of the football process to me.
I read Leonid Fedon's interview.
State, please, let's make the law faster.
The feeling that these Baaries' patients came to Jaroslawl and all made it up.
And we're side observers.
And it's horrible to see how the tribe is running out of the broadband.
And it's in the country that's preparing for the world's campaign.
"I feel that we returned 10-15 years ago," said Mutko.
Disappointment may be asked in Russia
The American Speaker's Ex-Cooperator Edward Snowden, mostly, will not go out of Russia to give evidence on telephone negotiations by the German Angel Mercel officer.
As the Interfax stated on Friday, the source of the situation could be answered by the American representatives of Germany in writing or eye in Russia.
Edward Snowden's exit for Russia's regions is almost excluded.
"In this case, he will lose the status of the refugee and may be issued to Washington by the United States aliens," said the Agency's conviction.
" However, in principle, the FGG's geneprocuration could send its representatives to the RF or send written issues to Snowden," added the source, adding that the question should be intergovernmentally addressed.
Earlier, the Deputy of the German Budget Hans-Christ Strubele reported that Edward Snowden was ready to give a witness to the audience of the American Speech Services of the German Kancelary.
Snowden will be ready to witness to German rightsguard authorities or in Moscow or in Germany.
Ex-cooperator of the CIA understands what he knows very much.
Although the United States NGO has blocked all its preventions, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, it is necessary to clearly determine all the conditions of his arrival," reported the Euronews Telephone.
Lawyer Snowden Anatolius Kucheren, commenting on the "Interfax" source statement, said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and when he would decide himself.
The United States citizen Edward Snowden, who worked at the United States National Security Agency (CNS) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, following information on the secret operations of the United States Specific Services on the Internet.
Snowden was flying through the transit of Moscow, but he was not able to leave the airport because his passport was cancelled by the United States authorities, and he was still in the transit area of the Shimethevo airport until August beginning.
On August 1, Snowden received a document for providing him a temporary refuge on Russian territory for a period per year and on the same day left the Sheremetjevo.
Yesterday, the American Anatolius Kucheren said that his client was built into a "group Russian company".
The last week, the German MMI reported that the NB was followed by the Angel Mercel.
According to journalists, the phone negotiations of the officer began to be heard in 2002.
The follow-up station as if it were in the United States post in Berlin.
The authorities of Germany, after the reporting, stated that the follower of Mercel was violating the laws and the sovereignty of Germany.

Ponomariv noted that it maintained the good terms with the regional " essers".
However, the mandate of the Deputy of Gosdoma, Eli Ponomarev, was refused.

Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of New York Commi-Festival: New Yorker
It may be courageously claimed that New York is a place of birth of standop comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago the Estrad artist Frank Fay, who works at the Palace Theatre theater in Broadway, started to tell the shots directly.
The news of the Fay has recently been taken by others, very recently, as New York Commedian Festival.
Caroline Hirsh, the foundation of the standap club of Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary in this year, recording more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“The majority of these headlines started in Carolines, and then increased success, reached the level when they were too famous to speak in the club,” said Hirsch.
We created this festival as a way to continue with them.
This year, the business includes Wanda Sakes, Cathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the "Standap for Helds" — an annual economic and commercial concert for military winds in Medison Square Garden, which will appear among the other Bruce Springstein, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The world of commodity has also been extended with the extension of the festival.
A number of comics involved in the festival this year have obtained the popularity in the non-traditional way, for example through a show on small televisions like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Crowl received the role in the comedian series of a small cabble telephone (in particular the "Lega" of FXX on the phantesis-football theme), and now it's its own schetch-shoo on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slayt entered the actor composition as in the "Saturday evening" and "Parks and relaxation zones", although it is most likely a series of "Marsel is a cancer in bottles".
And Croll, and Slayt, as well as other young communists with self-being style (surrealist pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, an injurious focused on the race of Camau Bell), are the result of the world of the American Commodity.
One of the lightest moments of the festival will be the interview of David Steinberg and Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stendap comic, but then he was a successful television register and film, as well as a neof historic of comedic.
Since 2005 to 2007, he was a leading TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be in Town Hall in the centre of Manhattan.
“This city is certainly the central element of the whole work of Larry”, said Steinberg.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes plays some shoes between the two houses, and he says, "This is if I stay completely without money, maybe I will live here."

Oil fell in price to $96 for a barrel.
The price for oil continued to fall on Friday, when the concerns for education of big stocks were disturbed by a report that the energy production sector of China was forced.
The United States oil set in December was 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel at the afternoon of Peeis' time at the New York Warehouse.
On Thursday, the contract passed by 39 cents, which amounted to 5.8 per cent in October.
Rich oil stocks have affected her value in the last weeks.
The Energy Ministry stated that the stocks of the United States were increased by 4.1 million barrelas in the last week.
In five weeks, the stocks were filled with more than 25 million barrelas.
On Friday, however, it was indicated that the question could be increased by judgeing two reports on the Chinese industry that demonstrated its impact on its activity.
This indicates that the restoration of China's economy could continue to be forced after the increase indicator in the third quarter has risen to 7.8 per cent after the twenty-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Oil Brent, a stalon of international oil, also used by the United States petroleum undertakings, has spent 26 cents to $108,58 for a barrel at the Intercontinental Barre in London.
The main trainer of Colorado Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the colkper of Semen Varlamov from the first minute in the Friday cat with Dallas, expressed the confidence that the last night after the arrest had not seized his confidence in Russian, transfers the "SE" from Dallas from Natalia Schmelei.
And what are we waiting, said Rua after the morning "Lavin".
Of course, what happened to us all will be worried, but we are sure of him and we feel that he will be able to get out of ice today.
We want him to get out of ice and show his normal level.
So you're absolutely sure that the situation hasn't spoken in the conditions of the door?
That's what we'll see today.
Of course, our players will support Warley by helping him to assemble the gate, as it was in the previous morning of the season.
Mostly, no one in the team will make any conclusions until the court is understood.
In Siberia, it should not be a weapon: a warm tomat will not replace the sugar
Why vegetation is not suitable for life in Siberia, the RIA News Correspondent explained.
People who are completely rejected from animal origin must not live in Siberia.
The winter will not be transferred without a loss of health, and no heavy mixtures will compensate them, considering the demanded Penalty of New Siberian dietologists and doctors on the Day of Vegan.
Drink oil with litres
A strict vegetary when not only meat and fish are refused, but also milk, honey, eggs become a moderate way of life.
However, the doctors-dietologists are convinced that in Novosibirska and other Siberia, there are strict food standards, such as at least, not for health.
The full refusal of animal products is.
Animal whites contain unlimitable aminosilotes, which are very difficult to compensate them.
It must be included in ration at least milk or egg," is the sure diotheolog Marina Bogai.
It offers a fish containing an unlimitable green oxide of Omega-3.
The richest oil is theirs.
"In order to use it in quantities for humans, you need to drink litres!" says the dietologist.
The doctors are convinced that the Siberian people should take the rational attention to the winter.
In this season, vegetation is particularly concerned.
In our circumstances, high food requirements are provided.
In order to not be hungry, it needs higher caloriety.
"If a person is in animal products, accordingly, he lacks this calorie," says the specialist.
This is the doctor of Olga Posnak.
It adds that transporting fruit and ff’tes are no output.
It is better for humans to feed primarily products produced in the area of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed to improve the use and recovery of these products.
And the winter people want not to swallow, but a warm cow or something more funeral," explains the doctor's position.
According to her, it is possible to eat vegetables that are actually different, crow, bovine, ≥ eggs remaining in the winter, frozen animals.
But this is, in fact, not enough for full-valued food.
According to the doctor-gastrointestinal of Claudia Arifolina, the vitamin levels in the systems are sufficient only from August mid-September.
The full crossing to vegetation in our hard natural conditions, when the temperature can be changed to 30 degrees and in May the snow is unclesoformed.
The organism needs energy for life, and this is primarily the harvest," says the medical.
The doctors note that the veganity is especially ≥ to children and to those who are unclean.
Children have needed a building material, including the form of aminosil.
And by keeping vegetarian, we give them incomplete.
The members also need a higher content of bee, vitamins and microelements in the menu.
"They are not obtained," I'm sure that God.
Arifuline says that an adult is willing to choose everything that is pleased to "play in the games that he wants."
He's already instructed organs, squelets, organs.
Yet, children need to eat fully.
If parents only have some micro-elements or aminocyl, choosing what he will eat, it is just a violation of the child's rights.
"The lack of those or other things for the development of the brain, the vision, the bones will not be restored tomorrow," she says.
All requested medical experts are in view of the low-quality of winter growing in the heat and transport fruit and fibres.
What are brought to us and grown in the heat contains less of micro-elements we have than (deprecated) in the open ground.
"The quantity of products isn't it," says Gody.
Arifuline also notes that transport and warm fruit and f’s fruits are far away from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to collect a large greenhouse causes quality damage.
"The emblems do not become raw in the screen, the swimming and dancing quickly, the smileys are unusual and aromatic," adds medical examples that they are, most likely, cut off with a excessive quantity of advantages.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cells.
This is not the inheritance of the Sibirian Agricultural Physics and Technical Institute, the Science Science candidate Vera Peteruk.
It states that in the proper approach and compliance with all standards and requirements at the levels of fruits, it is possible to produce full fruit.
If they are trying to extinguish more from a square meter, they will, of course, become more frequent and re-cover the mineral advantages.
For example, when too many azotes are quick, they are big, but waterful and weak," she explains, adding that the quality issue, firstly, depends on the consciousness of the manufacturer.
The Court stopped the execution of the decision on the "Stop-and-Buscate" at the Department of the Police of New York
On Thursday, the Court of Auditors of the Federal Circle stopped the execution of the judicial establishment required amendments to the programme "Stop-and-Buscate" of the New York Department of Police and removed the judge from the case.
The Apelation Court of the Second United States stated that the compliance with the decisions of the judge Shira Shendlin would be stopped before the results of the accusation given by the city.
In August, the judge stated that the city had violated the constitution in the implementation of the programme for detentions and investigations.
The city made a complaint on its decision and settlement of corrective measures, including the prescription to appoint the controller to help the police change in work and the training programme with it.
On Wednesday, the Court of Auditors heard the debate on the proceedings on the proceedings.
The Court of Auditors stated the need for a judge to be sent down because it violated the code of the behaviour of the US judges and did not consider the need to avoid the demonstration of prejudice, partly because of a series of interviews in the SMEs and official statements containing public response to the criticism of the court.
The Court claimed that police officers violated the rights of decades of thousands of people, unbasedly referring to black and Latin Americans on the programme "stop-y-spot".
She appointed an external controller to monitor scale changes, including political, education and control reforms, as well as launching the pilot program for television video camera testing in the police parts of the majority of detentions.
In August, New York decided to stop the preservation of names and addresses of people who had been interrupted after the police check.
The appointment of the city must be held after 14 March 2014.
The tacticity of ' stop and search ' was criticized by civil rights.
The ‘residence’ has been decades in the form of the same, but the number of documentated residues has been rarely increased in the administration of the independent Meeting Michael Blumberg, with the absolute record in 2011 in 684 330 people, most of whom black and latin Americans.
In 2004, four people, who were representatives of the national minorities, gave a collective trial.
Participants of the changes in the programme "Stop-and-Buscate" in the Department of New York say that these changes are the end of the non-conscious, form a more reliable and effective police service and may affect how other departments of the police are able to deal with this.
The opponents claim that changes will be reduced by the fighting spirit of police and not by crime, lead to unnecessary losses of money and will not solve a more global problem of the police complex because of decreasing the number of officers for a few thousand in the past decades.
The Court noted that it did not interrupt the "stop-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y, which, which, which, which co-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-e-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y--y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-
In the area of the Trijakov Gallery, a preliminary area was opened
In Moscow there was a new preliminary area.
It is divided in the Trijakov Gallery area and is involved in two miles from the "New Cuznécaya" metro to the Boltplate.
At all times, adequate towers, flowers, stomachs, furniture, and toilets have been set up, deep bullets and illegal advertising.

Coulson's call to the phone for the verification of the confidential report
The former News of the World Andy Coulson reported "the phone, the seat and the opposite" in trying to confirm false information about the Romans of Clark, who was at that time posted by the Minister of Internal Affairs.
The Prosecutor, Andrew Eddis, reported to the Court of Auditors that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World received an uncertain news that Clark was met with his "attracted special adviser" Hanny Polby.
The magazine ordered Glenna Mulcair to break the voice of Polby and watched her at home to take an interview, but Coulson also called her and gave her the rest of the votes, “the court heard.
"The complaint believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of notW, is not a person who will stand near someone's house, hopeing to be a man who loves to offer the story of people to see what they will say," said Mr. Eddis.
He said that the news of the World was three ways to investigate stories: telephone breakdown, sequence and opposite.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about the black, he just needs.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone break?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yeah."
The Romanians of Clark first took attention to the News of the World when the source, sexually interested in Mrs. Polby, said, "Don't lose time, it's with."
The cassette with voting messages received from her phone at least three times was exempted from the house of Mulkair in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the private child's computer, in which Mrs. Polby and her sister are "Projects".
During the period when she was under the seat, Mrs. Polby and grandfather received anonymous calls for information about it, said Mr. Edis.
At that time, the former Master Reporter Neville Turtlebeck and the former reporter James Weserap control followed Mrs. Polby's predictions.
On 18 June 2005, Colson said to her, "I have a story that we are planning to repeat tomorrow and that I would like to discuss with."
Mr. Edis said that Colson's participation in this history had occurred in the same scenario as with other influential people, such as the former Minister for Internal Affairs of David Blanket.
On Thursday, the jury heard that Coulson entered the conflict with Mr. Blankett on the behavior of a married woman during his meeting with Rebecca Brooks, who was at that moment married.
Coulson and Brux refused to negotiate with other people in order to break phones from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulkair, Turk, and Wezerape admitted the phone breaking.

U.S. Awards for poor
P's food for the family of four people is reduced by $36 per month
From Friday in the United States, the financial provision of product talents which are "fudst" is reduced, since the relevant public programme is completed.
A family of four persons will now be assigned at least $36 per month than before, stated by the office.
This will take 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to the Reiter Agency, the financial year 2012 asset for one person was a average of $133 per month.
Training assistance costs in the United States increased up to 80 billion dollars per year because of growth without food and prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of the Americans are trusted in the free trade assistance issued by the " footsteps", which has been called from the past when they had a form of paper buffets.
When the current economic crisis was started, the programme was extended to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the responsibility of the Congress requires further reductions for the programme, claiming that it should be healed for helping those who need more others.
Manufacturers of the trading stores throughout America are concerned that reductions will lead to decreasing consumer costs.
The United States Congressmen continue to discuss how much more the Government can be reduced.
The 19-year-old former was released freely.
Study ́zzard freely released on the PC its formula in 1994 Blackthorne.
That's what WoW Insider reports.
According to his data, the game was available in Battle.net in the classic games section.
However, some gayers note that it is currently possible for only users whose accounts are related to the American part of the service.
The game is not yet available for Russian users.
As before_MMI, the version that has now been released on the PC does not be different from the original game option.
Soundtreck to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
Blackthorne Platformer, which was released 19 years ago, was originally on SNES console.
His events were disappointed on the Toul Planet, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light Kingdom.
One of the dark rulers, Sarah, decided to kill the light King of Vlaros and become a single ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending the earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tull to fight Sarlock's hosts and protect the residents of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne became the first game that the study released after her rename to \zzard Entertainment.
Before it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne's publisher was Interplay's company.

The National Security Agency's recognition strengthens paranoid corporations in respect of the State Security
On the end of August, the German police holiday passed lowly over the United States Consultation in France, the German financial capital.
According to the Federal Department of Constitution Protection (BfV), the Service of Internal Inquiry of Germany, it was to photograph the statement of the United States representative, which is less than 5 km from the Central Bank and Bundesbanc.
The German SMEs say that BfV had hoped to find antenes of listening devices, and these actions had negotiated between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin.
James Clayper, Director of the United States National Intelligence, again assured that the United States did not use the possibility of external instructions “to deal with commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interests of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or to increase their acquisition”.
However, since Edward Snowden is a contractual employer who has made a discharger, he has started to put his stock of the secrets of the United States, the Governments of Peace and Ru firms are no longer sure they can believe the Director in the word.
The reports that the United States National Security Agency monitored the Brazilian Petrovas oil company and received access to the data stored by the U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paranoid corporations caused by the State at new heights.
The last chapter was the fact that the phone of the officer of the Angela Mercel was probably heard about ten years.
If the most influential person could become a mixture, of course, I'm also business leaders.
Snowden made a clear intense cooperation between the United States and companies.
I think that these data are totally likely to be used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up”, says Oliver Green, president of the BITMi Joint, representing the small and medium IT company of Germany.
The German companies are convinced that the United States now represent almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial spionage and data broadcasting, of an investigation on the EY Consular Agency held in July.
In all documents discovered by Mr. Snowden, however, there were no witnesses that the United States had transmitted commercial secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
The politicians expressed peace because the EU was not enough for certain in-technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependency from the United States.
Businessmen are skeptically related to this.
Someone in Germany's parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close the eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not a alternative”, says Gaso Pla ́ner, the President of the German Software Supplier for Business SAP.
If it was necessary in the powerful IT industry, it would not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
All are subsidiated in Germany: from carbon to car and farmers.
Everything except IT industry.
Nevertheless, the range and technical development of the United States spying agencies made by Snowden's revelations were a shock for some firms who had previously thought that the highest risk of follow-up was China.
A big movement occurs in cloud technologies where the pig firms better realized that data contained in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to the survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance Association, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused plans and used the services of the U.S. N.S. N.A. after the discharge of the American Programme for the intellectual Prism data analysis.
Jim Snib, one of the Executive Directors of SAP, said: "We see the users behind the new question that has not occurred a year ago, namely where my data are stored and if you can guarantee that they are physically in this jurisdiction."
Many German rulers claim that the last reports are only under what they already knew: the powerful States want to steal their most precious secrets, and therefore these data should be protected by any price.
What happens to the economic spionship is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“This was the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed in the current field”, says Kurt Bok, the main executive director of the BASF company.
The Americans are spying after us at commercial and industrial level, and we also follow them, because it involves our national interests in protecting our business.
Corporation leaders usually do not like to take the responsible measures they have taken, as it can give the opponent a privilege.
In major companies has already been aware that to take a free bottle on exhibition or leave a laptop without supervision in the hotel room, at least it is unexpected.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Audi Car-Institute Board, says that it is a standard about for many years to collect mobile phones before the Government meetings so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The Federal Department of the Constitutional Protection of Germany recommends to the company's holders to consider the possibility of use of remote mobile phones in the time of the busy trains because of the wounds of smartphones.
Prepayed mobi's phones are subsequently opened.
However, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to breaches and traces.
In Germany, many such companies are the leaders of the world market in my specific neck.
The BfV report warns: “Small and medium-sized companies are often lacking experience, and financial resources to protect corporate secrets from non-sanstioned access.”
The United States warn their own companies about economic spying from other countries.
The United States National Discovery summary in February placed France with Russia and Israel in a second range of criminals who are in hacker for economic disclosure after China, acknowledged the Washington Post.
The Board of Directors of the Prestigious German Company confirmed that, when the fact and regarding the economic spying, “France is worse than all”.
Bernard Scarsiny, an ex-France Internal Agency for Interviews, as reported in this month, stated: "The services are well known that even when they cooperate in combating terrorism, they are spying their associates."
Parents of a growth in Georgia, who died in “soft accident”, believe that their son was killed
Parents of a growth in Georgia, whose body was found inside of a reversed mother in the medium-school room, believe that their son was killed, stated to the family on Thursday.
Candrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertically standing mother, sent back to tribes in the elective school room.
The supervisors of the Sheriff of Londres surveys concluded that Johnson died in a trace of accidents, but the 17-year-old growth family was aware of it.
"They are absolutely sure that their son was killed," said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, representing Kenneth and Jacklin Johnson.
They never believed he was dead as the sheriff says.
"They believe that it is contrary to logic, physical laws, and healthy meaning," Kramp said.
They think that this is a covering for the protection of humans or people responsible for their son's death.
He said, “They sent their son to school with a cup of school, and they returned him to their bodies.”
The American Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation of Johnson's death, noting that several key issues remained without answer.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of crime?
The Mure made a statement of the press conference on Thursday.
I'll study all the facts wherever they are.
My goal is to know the truth.
He said, "I believe that there are enough initiatives" for an official investigation, he said.
More told reporters that the original discovery showed that Johnson died as a result of the "local assistance".
However, the second revelation, according to Moura, showed another cause of death.
“There are several questions to be solved or corrected,” he said.
The Mure added that if he finds enough opportunity to need a voting or civil investigation of Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Sheriff of Londres was not available for a comment when he was addressed on Thursday.
The Judge of South Georgia in the middle of the environment for the authorities to repeat all the video records of the monitoring cameras.
The adult parents said that they hoped that video records contained the key to recall how he died.

The monitoring and profiling centres of diseases have issued recommendations for schools with alergies in children
In the middle of the Control and Profile Centre of Disasters, the list of recommendations on the monitoring of food allergies in children in school.
This is the first series of similar recommendations that the Government of the United States issued, while the number of children of school age suffering from food allergies.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has food allergies.
The monitoring and profiling of diseases has discovered that the distribution of food allergies among children has increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
Ru includes information for the school about how to increase the knowledge of teachers and the service officer of food allergies in children and how to assist in the event of allergic reactions.
It also recommends schools to keep adrenalina reserves, most often used for injection by EpiPen’s automatic medical pharmacovigilance — to assist in potentially mortal anafil.
The laws of the State authorities have recently amended the Regulation to allow schools to make adrenalina stocks with less difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with allergic reactions.
Children can say, "a feeling like something comes into my tongue," "a feeling that I have hair in my tongue" or "the speech language".
Intersexual Children's parents may choose "undetermined sex"
Germany became the first country of Pepee, which recognised the third country of children born with non-external sex bodies of the interim type.
The newborn will no longer have to be assigned to a man or a woman.
The new law does not require parents to call any of these children by allowing parents to specify the field as “undefined” or “undefined” in their birth certificates.
The objective of the law was to distort the pressure of parents who could make successful decisions on sexual adoption of newborn ones and to oppose discrimination of intersexual people.
A intersexual person, BBC, said many years later, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I'm gonna be created by doctors with blue and shirts.
About one of two thousand children, born every year, is not a boy or a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological states under the diagnosis of “sexual developments”, is a collective term for people with athical chromosomes, gonades (sheeps or seeds) or unusually developed foreign sex bodies.
Wellis Simpson may have been an intersexual.
The gender ID has not been adequately studied, but most of the U.S. experts say that if it is not able to be defined, it is better to use all the inhibitors and to grant it as to wait and follow the psychology and physical development of the child before the operation if it happens.
New York Psychiater, Dr. Jack Dresser, specialised on gender identity problems, said that the new German law "sounds as a good idea".
Intersexual children create a ethical dilemma.
“There are some people who have threatening disorders that require operational interactions, but most of them do not have, ” he said.
You can assign a field without operation and then see how the identity is developing.
The science of the gender identity of the child is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this happens.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the Commission in 2011 describes intersexual people as different from transsexual or transgender, since they have regard not to gender but to their biological building, which does not correspond exclusively to male or female sex, and typically not to both of them at the same time.
These characteristics may be shown in secondary characteristics such as muscle mass, departure of covered cover, breast and tolerance; primary sex characters such as reproductive organs and genitalities, or in the structure of chromos and hormones.
The report also provides a general presentation of discrimination with intersection and transgender people in the field of occupation, as well as the level of pressure, violence and crime on the ground of prejudice.
Boys with gender rejections now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already permitted adults to put men, women or "third sex" in their official documents.
In June 52-year Australian resident Norry Maywellby’s first person in the world recognized as "bespool" was detained in the court to maintain the "undefined" sex status for life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, German passports will use the third term in addition to M and F-X, which is intersexual.
In neighbor France, gender issues are still addressed against the new release of France 24.
In 2011, decades of French legislators, this clearly expressed cathole of the country, signed five of the exhibition of the "gender theory" from school teachers.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed non-contrasts with the German law, wrote that “in the situation when the world is involved in a new way, where the field is the subject of choice, and sexual activity is not, we turn two other civilization columns.”
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to set the field on birth.
"To grow a child is hard enough and without additional initiatives, especially if you don't know the half of your child," she said to the parents' website.
Children need stability and confidence.
History children born with male and female sex bodies were called Hermaphrodites, named a beautiful Greek god who had the signs of both sexes.
And only ten years ago, the medical community accepted gender as a sheet on which everything could be watched and then drawn again.
But now, many are spending the ethics for the operational surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and sometimes the doctor makes a wrong choice, without knowing how the child will take his own field when he grows.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called "unexpected psychiatric case", said Druster.
When such children were born, you called no psychiatric, and you called the chirurg.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate genitals was proposed by Dr. John Mani at Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily changed.
He introduced the term “genetic identity” and said that the signals of the environment, including the way parents set up a child, were interacting with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a person would be a man or woman.
But in one case of 1966, as John/Joan, his theories were subjected.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was injured during the circonscription, castrated the child completely, removed his eggs, and kept him as a girl.
"Mani has been a successful example of transition, but it was not true," Drusser said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he was again a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that some doctors are still "applying this model".
But in the 1990s, when the Internet arrived, people who survived these sex exchange operations declared themselves, "increasingly as a result".
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montan, who was born with men's chromosomes XY, but the genitality of the intermediate type.
The doctor could not determine exactly whether he had a large cliter or a small penis, and they were assured that he could never live a "valuable life" of a man.
Thus, after he was born in 1976, the external sex body and Bruce eggs were surgeryly removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He had a 12 - year - old female hormone.
"I knew I was not a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unfortunate, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years, he was assigned to a vaginoplastic.
But when he was in depression and realized that something was wrong, he needed a medical document.
What he knew was terrible.
I was sterilized when I was born, and no one told me about it.
Bruce was born with a pollution of sex development, which did not give her body to produce enough teststeron for normal genital development.
When he learned the truth, he repeatedly was a man receiving a testosteron and removed his breast.
The operation made it unfruitful.
Today, it is to protect others in the organization called Interface Project, trying to bring people with intersexuality into line.
But Ann Themar Mattis, the Executive Director of the Californian Association of Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "invites the shipment and reach".
“Multium activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a successful decision and give the child "undefined sex", said she.
We are afraid that he will participate in the involvement.
We think it's better for a husband or a woman and then to wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will show us, so all we can do is building suggestions.
Themar Mattis said that it was supported by the Australian Law, since “He allows adults to choose for the benefit of third sex”.
“The adults must have the opportunity to make their own decisions on formal sex belonging”, says she.
The German Law underneaths its adoption at birth.
This is a battle in which little children should not be involved in this stage.
When they grow, they will be able to make decisions of their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Baratz, a mammolog-rentgenolog from Pi'sburg, who has a daughter with sex development and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law will "support" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Kathy, was born with men's chromosomes, but she has a sex development injury called "the singer of full insensitivity to the androgenans".
Since its androgene recipients work incorrectly, Cathy has developed women's signs.
She's got an instruction, but there's no mothers and eggs.
Now, at 29 years of age, Cathy's married and passed by the psychiatric orchid at the Pen-Wayan University.
Despite its unfruitfulness, she hopes to be a parent through the creation or gestational surgical maternity.
“The Law gives parents time to not make the decisions themselves,” said Baratz.
He allows them to make some analysis and discern the situation, as well as the time before they write "man" or "woman".
In that case, you’re okay — you’re a child, you love your child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joyful.
We don't have to do an oper that is unreversibly.
"It allows parents to participate in the decision and to remove anxiety that moves their parents because they do not feel that progress is correct," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what kind of sex he or she is more comfortable, and it is wonderful.
This provides the opportunity to make a decision on the basis of the decision.
Chicago's brother Nikolai Habibulin stressed: he understands that he should play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work at training.
At the last two meetings, Habibulin had lost six shabs from Tampa Bay, and then four from "Ottawy", and in the second game, he was replaced after the fourth past shade.
We must play well, and in the last two games, I did not do this -- brings the CSNChicago word of Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in trainings, probably to approach them as games, and try to achieve a better result.
You have to study your past games and get over the deficiencies that were.
There's a few small components that I need to improve, but in training, I feel pretty good.
But sometimes after several times, it's turned into some snow com.
Maybe I need to get a little delight.

In the days, the same new village was held in the village of Ivanobe, the province of Petric, in the neighborhood of Ana.
The formula was set up here on an ancient term, only on the carrier.
Ornitologists are convinced that cautious, conservative birds will not even note the weight that their " apartment" has been subject to capital reparation.
Before the end of the year, the river is expecting four other nids in the Decoration and the Caribbean regions of the Dane-Petership.
Moreover, while some saved rare birds, others unfortunately killed them.
On the day, the whole area of distress -- the splendid news -- in the village of the Apostle Chamber, on the day of the opening of the fashions, married ones had shot the lebetic family on the powder.
The beauty birds did not fear people -- the inhabitants of their feed and did not grieve.

Communication: The pre-elected state of Obama examined the exception of Bayden for the benefit of Hillary Clinton
The New York Times reported that the nearest advisers of President Barak Obama had a secret examination of the possibility of replacement of Vice-President Joe Bayden by Hillary Clinton's candidate in the electoral list of 2012.
This opening is the most clear sensation of all the expected book Mark Galperin and John Hayleman on the 2012 campaign "Double: Game has changed 2012".
The Times received an exemplary prepared for the output of the book and reported on Thursday evening that the closer president's assistants had conducted “scale studies in the focal groups and public opinions at the end of 2011” to evaluate whether the exception of Baiden could help to raise the extent of the hope of the reelecting of Obama.
According to the political viewer The Times Jonathan Mar, the book provides a detailed description of the efforts of high-super-super-schooled representatives and the White House, namely the former Chairman of the White House of Bill Daily, to evaluate the impact of the voting by the former secretary Clinton Vice-President.
The potential replacement was a secret, carefully protected at the Chicago Pre-election station and in the Wolf Office.
Only six closer advisers of the president, including Daily, the former head of the pre-elected stage of Obama Jimson, and would have known the senior advisers of the White House of David Axelrod and David Pluff, that the replacement was considered.
The book "Double Steaks" states that Daily was an initiator of the trying to replace Bayden, despite their "nearly similarities", but finally refused from this step when their data showed that the addment of Clinton to the electoral list would not "be able to improve the opportunities of Obama".
In the interview with Martin Daily, the administration had actually examined the possibility of replacement of Bayden Clinton.
“I was actively pronounced for the consideration of the matters, and it was one of them”, said Daily’s newspaper.
You must remember that the president was in a terrible form at that moment, so we thought, "O my God, what do we do?"
Although Daily characterized the investigation as “necessary verification”, Martin told CNN Anderson Cooper that the pre-elected state had a lot involved in the study of the voting step.
"Preference staff do not lose such money for questioning and focus group if they do not consider anything serious," said Martin in the AK 360 programme.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team studied the possibility of replacement.
Martin told the CNN that he asked Daily if he knew his boss at that time about the possible transmission.
Although Daily said he didn't think that the President was in the course of a possible replacement, the former director of the Administration recognized that Obama knew, "no".
Martin added that "Double Steaks" did not give clear answers to the question whether the results of the political divisions were achieved to the table of Obama.
Cooper asked Mar if he thought seriously that Obama was not able to investigate the possibility of eliminating Baiden from the electoral puzzle.
“It's possible, ” answered Martin.
Do you want a lighting in the darkness of the frozen?
The British undertaking created the first world light in the darkness of the frozen with medus.
Frances has spent the fluorescent characteristics of the sea animal in order to break lighting food.
He came to this idea by reading the scientific article on medical medicals, and convinced the scientists in China to rebuild chemically a lighting white.
Frozen reacts with the language of a man who eats it and increases the pH level in the white and makes it light.
Chris says that since the milk begins to light when it reacts to the warm mouth, that means, as much as you lie, it becomes lighter.
The foundation of the cold-production company "Liz me, I'm cool," says, "It's a wonderful thing, but still at the main stage if you talk about production, so you'll get about 2 200 years of art."
The light that we use in the frozen reactions with your language in neutral pH.
Thus, when your mouth burns the white, it will increase the pH level and the milk will begin to light.
We tested it in the past few months, and it seemed to be ideal for it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful lighting effect.
This may be the most dear yellow of what I did, because the luminosity of the medus is four times more precious than gold.
So every shot's worth me about 140 pounds.
So it's pretty pleasant for the bathroom.
The experimental company, divided in Bristol, was designed by its inhabitants, including beverage, syringe, beverage and sustenance of social gold.
However, his creation must be even more ambiguous.
He said, "I want to keep the invisible meat once."
It's definitely not because of the breakdown of ice cristals, from which is frozen, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
Frozen uses fluorescent properties of medus synthesized by Chinese scientists

However, statistics show that I'm a white hole in the case of Halloween.
According to the National Federation of Diversity Trade, most of the Americans — exactly 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and totally cost 6.9 billion dollars for conferences, costumes and improvements.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Federation of Diversity Trade Prognoses that $1,2 billion on costs of $6.9 billion.
This year, on sex mode’s pica, unexpected objects.
Women are no longer obliged to be representatives of sexual professionals; they may also be sexual food, such as pizzas, hamburgers or martyrs.
I think we'll see the zombies through the Hoods of the Dead, and I'm sure the Cosmonwates in Daft Punk's style will fall into our bands of Instagram this year.
According to Google, the costumes that are most often looking for are zombies, Bethman, pirates and wheat.
Please, there's nothing wrong in the traditional approach.
We arranged our dogs last year and, for my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Furthermore, the National Federation of Diversity Trade, the Americans will pay $330 million for domestic animals this year.
This means a lot of fun dogs.
When the case comes to the conference, we're not quiet.
The Americans will pay $1.9 billion this year, Nilsen's company.

The only thing we don't want to use is cooking cereals; however, the National Container Association is sold by nearly 35 million pounds under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion of sugar-shirts.
It's a mystery that I still have to talk about.

Furthermore, according to the American Haunts society, there are 1200 officially recognised houses with awards generating about $500 million, and those on the graphs that you almost described, which your friend expressed on Facebook, and you can't remove, and then the guy you like sees this graph and remains a comment like "classical expression".
And finally, we'll talk about the sticks.
Brown met us with the Great Tickwa, when we were children, and the cutting of Jack's light is as the ornament of the birthday wheel, what we're doing from Property.
Happy for us, the child's modality in the tikwa started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us were grown, cutting these tickets, not sitting in them.
According to the report of the United States Population Office, the Americans will pay about $106 million per ticket this year.
Jack's lighter, quickly drying on your wings, probably came from Illinois, who grew up 542 million pounds of tickets this year.

The Russian forcers have nothing to do about the " Bratski Circle" grouping - New Reports
In this regard, INTERFAX.RU writes with an information source in the RF legal protection authorities.
"When reports had been reported in the MMI on the introduction by the United States Finance Minister of Beps in suspicious suspiciousness of the Jewish Criminal Syndicate ' Broadish ', we have examined all the databases, but such groups have not been found," said the Agency's conviction.
It considers that the distribution of the information is a way to maintain the myth of the Russian mafia that is likely working behind the roof.
As it was written earlier, the United States Finance Minister op on its website was a list of the preferred members of the "Bratski Circle" criminal group.
Among them was also called a Russian song of Gregory Leps.
He's figured in the list as "Grysh", and he's exposed to the penalty.

Moreover, Lepps actually bought a house at Phuckette recently.
It was noted that they were to introduce sanctions against Leps.
The introduction of humans in the American Minfin's black shops will be the locking of its assets in the United States and the prohibition of business contacts with those who live in the United States.
Lepsa Maya Serikov's assistant stated that no notification to the song had been made: "It is difficult to answer the question whether this is the Grigorian, about which all are now talking about scandal in the United States."
Everything Leps knows is the MMI information.
There were no notices to him personally, although I don't know whether they are in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other side, it's amazing and unexpected," she said RIA News.
According to her, Phucket Gregory Leps doesn't live, but, as Minfin states, he really has a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps is now in a long tour on the Deep East and Siberia, and that the news left him while he was flying to the city of Bogweensk.

"Instead, the Greek reported how the fan was broken in the field: "The person, called him a visionary, went to a quick assistance in carrying out two viewers, faced with heart problems.
He approached a quick help, and the doctor confirmed us quickly.
Then he cut off two followers and fled to the field.
He fled from the angle of the East and the South Court to the angle of the East and North Court.
He fled through all the fields.
That's what the Stuards are responsible for.
Before the entry into force of the Law on the stairs, the police cannot be involved in what is on the field.
He reached the court, passed through the Eastern Court.
And at that time the wrath began on the East Court and on the run traces," said the CDC chapter.

She was happy to save after calling for fire teams to lift it up and bring it to a safe place, after he had somehow locked 50 feet heights at a dangerous degree of dish.
The nine-month cocker-spanel Ruby fled after the car-shopping division on Sunday, and spent three days alone before it was saved from the career to the middle.
Her lady, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old Becky Hall, were located in the Flappit carrier in Denholm in Western Yorkshire to join Ruby and welcomed the west Yorkshire fire-free service.
They solemnly searched for their missing dog and placed treatments on the web sites after she fled to the career after a little disorder.
Approximately at 14:15 in the middle of the star room observed Ruby, a 50-foot height in the career.
The Technical Rescue Team with the Fire of Klekhiton has succeeded to the occurrence, descended down on the roofs to save Ruby, and split the ship to raise it on the top of the screen.
The Officer of the Officer of Andy Clayton said, "He was in a dangerous position."
It was right in the middle of the woods, 50 feet to the top and to the earth.
She wasn't moved with a muscle during the salvation, she was completely stuck.
But now she's okay.
Then she's a sand.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that a dog has noticed is incredible.
The officer of the specialist saved Peter Law's officer said, "Ruby was very lucky to save her."
It was likely that she could get a very serious trauma or worse.
Rubys were brought to the veterinary, and it was established that it was all right, except deterioration and deterioration.
Mrs. Hall, from Galifax, West Yorkshire, said: "The observation of salvation was worth."
I couldn't believe she was there.
It was wonderful when she was again about our hands.
The veterinarian said that if she had lost a conscience, she would mostly fall.
The fires were beautiful.
It was very courageous — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely according to them.
Mr. Alderson from Kitley added: "We were afraid she could fall, but she remained there."
The fires were amazing.
I just can't believe she's about it.
Mike Jagger says he didn't play with Cathy Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview in Australia for the Pop-Star on this week, she said she was a bac-wocalist for Jagger's song in 2004 Old habits die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a rock-veter, and she said, "He played with me when I was 18 years old."
She added: "This was a long time, and he was very good."
In a statement on Thursday, the representative of the seventy-year-old Jagger said that “the category refuses that he had ever seduced Cathy Perry”.
The representative added: "It may be that he will be able to spend it with someone else."
Perry was among artists who appeared as guests in Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new Prism album is ticked at the first time of this week.
George Carevan: breaking with a choice is given to Switzerland
Another day, another side of independence.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland should be accompanied by the general free movement area as a condition of membership in the EU.
There are a series of stories on passport control in Berwick and the border with the wheels of Adrian's wall.
True, the newspaper Strathclyde has to have economic benefits from more free movements in the rest, although, as it is predicted, it was not in the headings.
No one also pointed out that the EU Member States have spent a lot of time to turn their rules back as appropriate.
Since Scotland is not now in the Schengen zone, the continuation of the non-compliance with the requirements will become a degree for Brussels, instead of what he really wanted from Scotland.
So this is not a deserving attention to the story.
And it was so old that it became a stone: I first heard the "subscription" of the "indipendence" means a passport control" at least 40 years ago.
Still, there's an interesting moment lost when the elderly story is overwhelmed.
Why should independent Scotland comply with the orders?
Why to change London's yarm to Brussels' yarm, especially now?
These are the present news of Pepee: the great successful plan to join has finally been deteriorated.
With the crisis, the project "Ev" is officially dead.
In all cases, the Union of Parties who are opposing the EU or rejecting it as one currency are forced.
Even in Germany, the "Alternative for Germany" party, which was only this year, came from nowhere and received nearly five million votes on the Federal elections of September, thus exhausted the "Free Democrats" (the analogue of our Liberal Democrats) from Bundestag.
There was always a internal opposition to the establishment of a federal plan.
However, the current economic crisis is a breakpoint.
The worst economy measures introduced by Berlin and the Central Bank, and the eye on national economys by maintaining one currency, brought many people to think that the Ev's project was too far.
The crisis is little because national governments work in excessive budget deficiencies, but it was just just for Greece.
In fact, the blocking system of its members in exchange courses for German exporters is that German policies and want to maintain.
Without the possibility of dealing with the national currency, the south is in the early unfair position of productive opportunities compared to Germany.
The only rescue means to cut payments and public expenditures actively supported by Berlin.
The current issues of the budget and currency are the deeper problem of production methods.
As a result of the "green" energy measures introduced by Brussels, the encryption, which represents the subsidiation of French and German energy companies on account of the consumer, will have the Peace industry two times more than electricity and four times more than gas than in the United States.
This is a paralyzing price conditions, as we have seen in Greingmoute.
No freezing payments in the world will remain a distorted winning of the United States solar gas over Pekah oil industry.
As a result, the rebellion, especially in France, is ever the worst EU side.
After war, the French political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on one level with Washington.
However, Berlin is no longer needed in Paris as a means of obtaining political stability, and has already linked its own economic policy by abandoning the disastered France economy.
Results are the right of the Marin Le Pen National Front against the EU, just winning the decision-making elections by rejecting the governing party of socialists to the third place.
Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of votes — a timely warning to the British lebories that it is supposed that the expansion between the right will be automatically stated for the benefit of the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newly conceived population among the French white slave class?
She wants to take elections in the EU in the year to create a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against one currency.
If this is very likely that the Parties against the EU will be supported by these elections, such blocks will first take a dominant situation in the European Parliament.
This is my opinion: the approaches against the EU and against one currency will soon be sold in order to set up.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something like "Ev's (sovereign) nations" that would like General de Holly.
Germany and several economics dependent on it may maintain, but France and South will restore their own currency.
I guess that UK is removed from this project, hopeing to draw close to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington's interest in the Pacific shows the probability that the United Kingdom will remain without attention in the Atlantic cold.
In what position will this remain in Scotland?
We can choose to be a region (in fact) of Small England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which is, besides, sending Berlin and Brussels to shirts.
I suspicious that Scotland will be able to achieve more free Paese agreements when we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other individual countries will be easier in the non-federality of the nations.
In other cases, we should consider the possibility of repeating the experience of Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Scotland National Party in Scotland is, as noteworthy, the most successful political movement in the action against the worst economy of the votes received in 2011 by reflecting the reductions of the costs proposed (and called) by the Leborist Officer of Cash Alister Darling and resulting in the coalition of two and liberal democrats.
Scotland would now be unfortunate to vote for independence only to take steps in the cruel economy of Berlin and Brussels.
Previous Sexual Review: Age
The African and Latin America's population, usually, has reached sex growth before their white coasts, have been investigated.
Physical changes do not mean that sex growth is close
No evidence that hormones are guilty or other chemical arts
Experts believe that the breathing epidemy may be one of the road mechanisms of early sex
The trend to early sex growth is not so exposed to boys
The former CNN Correspondent Pat Etterje is a journalist specialized for family health and health issues.
Should the mother be afraid if her daughter begins to form milk iron and grow hair in 7 or 8 years?
At the annual Conference of the American Pediatric Academy on this week in Orlando, Florida, the Endocrinolog Dr. Paul Caplavitz explained that these early physical changes were sufficiently distributed among the American girls and represented a new standard.
"I'm spending a lot of time to relax your parents -- it usually doesn't mean a fast growth of full sex," said Caplowitz.
Obvious development signs, such as breast-feeding, lower and mixed hair and body worms, are previously presented in girls.
But there was only a small movement in my age (the first mixture) during the last four decades.
The average age in the United States is 12.5 years and has been decreased in comparison with 12.75 in 1970.
“When the breast begins to develop, at least two or three years before me”, Kaplovitz said, “I am also the author of the book “Free Sexual Review of girls: how to cope with this diffused problem.
The time is the most accurate check of the progress of sexual growth.
The debate is discussed about the fact of sexual growth, but it is considered “pre-temporary” when the growth of the breast results in extreme growth to 8 years.
In most cases, the process is quiet or stopped is that the pediater can follow carefully.
Increasing progress can serve for an endocrinolog analysis to avoid serious problems such as bullets or kiss.
There are procedures to detain the early meals and to prevent another consequence: the preliminary age of bones, which finally can lead to slow growth and low growth in adults.
Medical or hormonal therapy recommendations are based on age, development, growth and emotional growth.
Psychocy is also important.
Caplowitz is cautious with medicines, but he admits that “the deterioration of sexual reactions may reduce behavior problems and feelings of girls that they are different from the headquarters”.
Another big problem is understanding: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have me.
“They are concerned about the risk of employment or even how they are going to cope with hygiene issues”, said Caplowitz.
“It was a shock”, recalls a woman whose daughter had started in 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about me, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from a scared and disappointed school because she was the first of her friends.
There are a lot of theories on the causes of early sex.
However, there is no consequences of the evidence of the guilty hormones in milk or other food products, chemical arts in the environment or sex.
Children — like girls — have sexual growth before.
Caplowitz claims that the suggestions which have the maximum weight are the epidemy of wheat.
In 2001, he helped girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which relates to the number of grass in the body to the periods of sex.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African and Latin Americas have usually reached sex growth before their white coasts.
There are different explanations.
In all the world, the earlier sex increasingly affects everything: economic and climate to genes.
More mystery: Although boys have hairs on their face and on their heads in a younger age, the trend to the full early sex reaction is not as much as girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP Conference have confirmed the complexity of this subject.
Even young children and children of age are met with the appearance of a honey and a hot hair.
“We must be able to determine how we determine the real growth of sex”, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, an endocrinolog in the Hospital of Gorieb in Mr. Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be disappointed to receive guidance from the child about how to talk to their child.
“This may mean more early than it was expected”, explained Caplowitz.
If you keep quiet, your child normally reacts well.
The girls who are blowing earlier must be understood that even when it happens to the previous place, this process is a normal part of life.
The American Boeing in Chita is ready to fly
The Watchtower of the Open Heaven Treaty on the Russian Territory and the middle unplanned airport in Lita on Friday, 1 November, will leave the city's aircraft at 8:30 per Moscow time.
The airport has allowed the board to run by receiving money for fuel.
As reported in the airport, the plane will go to Ulan-Ude.
Secondly, it's going to be in the United States.
As reported, the aircraft in Ulan-Uda was landed in Zabaikalland because of the tuman.
It was not released from Chita airport because of unpaid accounts.
There are 30 people on the plane board, including the equip, two nights in the airport territory, reports ITAR-TASS.
As reported in the Middle RF, the conditions of the Open Heaven Treaty that people on the aircraft have no right to go outside the airports of Chita may only be carried out in two Russian airports in Cuban and Ulan-Uda.
The Open Heaven Treaty was signed in 1992 and 34 States participated in it.
Flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, countries.
The basic tasks of the Treaty are to develop transparency, to monitor the implementation of inflation control agreements, to enhance crisis prevention and to resolve crisis situations within the OSCE and other organizations.
How many vacancies are won - MK in the United States
The estimation of live rents with the highest income in 2013 was charged by Madonna, which had $125 million.
But it was "founded" by the relaxed Michael Jackson, whose income from October 2012 to October 2013 was from 160 million.
It is noted that others who have come out of the lives of famousness are dismissed, which are fewer than a few times in the past year.
Second, in the list of the most "statusful" nominations found in the Forbes magazine, Elvis Presley was 55 million per year, and the underlying author of the Comics of Peanuts with 37 million Schulz.
Furthermore, Elizabeth Taylor, former leader (25 million), and Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also includes Marylin Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
In Moscow, Igory Golaev was opened
On October 23, Igory Gulaev was opened in Moscow.
The designer Igory Gulaev is a wide range of its wonderful products from the lux class mechanic.
And now they will be able to evaluate more moda worshippers -- in Moscow, at the end, his first box was opened, according to the conduct of the designer and built a party in the sweet life style.
I'm sure that in Russia the most beautiful ones will be.
That's why I'm especially glad that I have a magazine in Moscow.
It's not just a office, but a place where there's really a part of me.
Exactly with these words, Igory cut off the red band and invited all those who wanted to... to imitate the models that were shot!
Reacting aircraft producers oppress the width of the seat when great orders on the horse
Among the leading aeroplane producers, the wide range of seats of the class's tourists was burned by the leadership of the aircraft, providing a tone for the confusion of the Dubai Airport exhibition this month.
The opposite turns around the width of seats supplied on a long-term railway passengers whose interests are not always in the centre of aircraft attention, while the amount of space for them plays a key role in the efficiency of the last airbus SAS and Boeing Co Airbus.
Airbus invited this week to introduce a growing standard, which would provide the width of the seat at least 18 cm (46 cm) in the economy class salons, but its main American competitor Boeing says that it should be decided by the aircraft.
The contrast and the time when aeroplane producers are being selling more larger versions of their two-motor distant aircraft, and potentially recruitable orders are expected on 17-21 November.
The back-up composite of the aircraft, especially if 9 or 10 persons are in a series, takes the central place in the economic efficiency statements of new "min-aerobus projects".
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will move 406 people from the seats in the economic class over 17 inch in the width of 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of A350 will transport 350 people in the economy class at 18 inch width seats, divided by 9 in row.
Aeroplane giants are often exchanged by technical attacks using the advertising in professional press.
Now Airbus is directly referring to the public before the airport in Dubai, where 777X, as expected, will become leader with more than 100 orders.
She has recently shown how a new advertising war could be started, showing a slideshow of three people in the restaurant, called "Should you agree on it?"
“Boeing has a long-term manager’s flying at seats higher than in regional tourist airlines”, said the Airbus John Lihi salesman.
With changes, racial foods are weighted, but aircraft seats have not changed cardinally.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the broadband Boeing 747 set the standards of modern long-term journeys, and the degree of the average American men's weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10 per cent, according to the United States Health Department.
The range of the US Median Man in the 21th century consists of 39.7 per cent, based on the statistical services of the United States Health.
Airbus claims that its competitor is holding the concept of the 1950s of the seats when the average volume of the Tali of those who have recently been called "reactive p" was already.
Airbus says that in a study that proves that the additional inch in the width of the seat improves the level of dream by 53 per cent.
Boeing split Airbus numbers on the sizes of the seats and says that producers should not be involved in the decisions on how the aircraft is found in the balance between tariffs and benefits.
According to her, studies are that salon behaviour depends not only on the width of the seat.
"All is actually concerned with the provision of aeroplane election and the possibility of doing what they think they have to do to succeed," said the Boeing specialist of the Kent Craver Salons.
They do not want us to decide what will bring them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
The issue for passengers is increasing the side space, but it is more frequently a factor that may affect the achievement.
This means that the planning orders evaluated at least $700 billion per catalog prices in the next decades are sufficient to change the proportion of the American and Pee export.
As reported first in July of the Reiter Agency, the location of the seats is exactly that the opposite of the fight between the newest reactive plane.
The Airbus and Boeing state a 20-percent increase in accessibility on one place in their last two-motor distant-motor models compared to the market leader in this section, Boeing 777-300ER.
Declared characteristics of Boeing are partly compared to 10-local rows 777X with the original 9-local row composite of the rows of the 777-local decision.
The victory is decreased in the comparison with the 10-local composite currently used.
"The reason Boeing does this is to impress more and make his flight more competitive than our times," said Kevin Kenistone, Chapter of the comfort of Airbus passengers in a position.
On the other hand, the analysers say that the salons with a full 10-local rows for 777-h show that many passengers prefer to a fleshly division that can go on hand with lower tariffs.
“The eighteenth inch width would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that Airbus proposal was threatened by 777 model”, said the expert on the interview of Mary Kirby, the foundation and editor of Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't set chairs, but have a directory of suppliers from which the aircompanys can choose.
The worldwide sellers of reactive aircraft even carry roulettes with them to check the competitive planning.
By praising the comfort, all manufacturers also have a very crucial composite plane for budgetary aircraft and regional flights.
Airbus has A350 with 10-local rows, but it says she has not sold it yet.
Airbus has recently highlighted the need for additional salons modes, and more broader spaces in some of their aircraft.
Without support of the only other producer of major modern aircraft, as the experts say, by calling it to a new growing standard, it may be “flying”, but it may be aware of the sale of model 777X.
The new anti-nictino vaccine may lose the smoking process of satisfaction
The scientists had an anti-nicotine vaccine that could lose the smoking cigarettes of satisfaction.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine dependence for the whole life.
There are further tests needed before testing on people for several years, but Professor Ronald Kristall from the Medical College Wayle Cornel in New York said that the first results were expected.
“We hope that such use of vaccine can finally help millions of smokers who were trying to leave by testing all the methods on the market today, but found that their notional dependency is sufficient to overcome it with these modern resources”, said Professor Cornel.
The new vaccine contains no virus that has been repeated to bring genetic information to the production of anti-cotine anticorps.
The virus selectively infects the vital cells that then begin producing a stable anticipation flow.
Antilles follow any molecules in the blood by neutralizing them before they reached the brain, preventing the obtaining of nicotine hit pump.
In the tests, the vaccinated mouse, which later had been given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And the mouths that did not give a vaccine were "free" and that is the sign that nobody came to their brain -- the researchers say,
These experiments are described in the magazine Science Translation Medicine.
Previous tabacco vaccines failed because they contained anthyl.
In order to maintain the high level of the anticipation, it was necessary to do so often that they were dear and unprofit.
But the value of the new vaccine will probably be much lower because it converts the cells in an anthony factory.
Professor Cristal said that if the future vaccine was fully safe, it could be given to the people before they had the desire to try a cigarette, preventing non-niquin dependency.
But more likely it's gonna be used to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not be satisfied with this because of a nicotine vaccine, and that can help them to get free of this habit," he said.
The British scientists said that the results were interested, but they had warned that they would supplement the investigation.
Oleiners: third of the rural villages of the Pools
Vice-governmental of the Submoscow Yuri Oleinikov said that almost a third of the rural villages in the Moscow area I was fully dotated
The total contributions from the region budget are obtained from 187 288.
In 2013, 187 288 residents were received from the regional budget.
The rate of assets in the 122 budget is over 50 per cent, and 83 per cent of assets.
In the framework of the budgetary security of the area budget, 25 billion rubles are addressed,” said Olaynik.
The vice-governmental officer also noted that only in three urban villages - Mutisch, Unico and Puschino - the amount of income is more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
Income in many areas of rural habitations is less than 3 million rubles, "it's totally not enough."
The expenditure for the content of the administrative equipment in 88 residences of the Podmoskovia is more than 70 per cent, "which is observed by the decrease of the quality of services," said Olaynik.
Earlier, he ordered the leaders of the municipalities to consider the populations needed in assembling, joining in the cities or amending the administrative system.
These proposals will be made from the end of January.
Before this, the Governor of Moscow stated that in the framework of the administrative reform in Podmoskovia, it was planned to decrease the number of landscapes.
Moreover, in the Mosaic, Cashirski, Solnecarski, Colombian regions, Luberts and Cotellians, there is a request for decreasing the Municipality.
The discussion of this issue in the cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
The chairman of Igory Britainal also stated that the coming admiral planning is about 30 rural villages in 12 areas of Podmoskovia.
This relates to the fact that from 178 landscapes in Podmoskova, at least thirds have a "acceptable" financial basis and 100 rates.
Diana Arbenina split Hellovin with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide what a great pleasure she receives from her children's education.
Despite the fact that Arbenine is currently giving a lot of time to creature and public activities, she still finds the opportunity to go with Martha and Artem, not only to take time for their training, but also to enjoy how it can.
In the last week, Diane had two times been reported to his worshippers about his pedagogic talents.
First, she presented a picture in Facebook, which sees how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, she was bailing the fans, she showed how Artem and Martha ordered Halloween.
Our first halloween' is called Diana's photography of his children clothed in festival costumes.
What is not wise, because they, as no other Russian boys and girls, have a view of this festival because they were born in America.
Germany introduces "undefined sex" in the registration of children
Germany will be the first country in which children are allowed to be registered, be born by hermaphrodites, the place of men or women to indicate "undetermined".
Parents of the child will have the right to leave the "pol" graph in a witness of the birth of an unfill.
Instead of "F" or "M" (many) parents can write "H" (undefined).
This decision is aimed at not taking parents to the speed of the "determination" of the sex.
According to statistics, one of the two thousand newborn in the world is born by hermaphrodite.
Tripodi refuses to have the effect of Obaida
The former Minister for the Work of New South Wales Joe Tripody will be the investigation of the anti-corruption supervisory body of this State.
The former Minister for the New South Wales Jo Tripodi rejects the amendment to the order of maritime objects, as requested by his political teacher Eddie Obaida, who had secretly owned tribute in three objects of independence on the State.
The independent committee against corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation on Friday, whether Mr. Obayd had a lot of ministers of the State to extend the contract on the Serkular Ki, where the Obaed family belongs to two restaurants and coffee, without the transition of the tender after the expiration of their action in August 2005.
It now investigates the fact that Mr. Tripodi knew about the secret participation of Mr. Obaida in the subjects of unnecessaryness, after the evidence of the former replacement head of Mr. Tripody Linn Espoul on Thursday.
During a few years of discussions, beginning in 2005, the Government insisted that the arrangement would be made for an open competition.
Arrangers were contrary to this, and they wanted more delays.
In 2009, the acquisition agreements on Sercillar Ki, which offered approximately $2,5 million per year, were extended without exposure to an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially pronounced for open competitions.
But he refused that changes were made to Mr. Obaida, who, as Mr. Tripody recognized, urged to make changes to the government's arbitrary policy.
The ICAC presented discryption of phones was introduced in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripoda and Steve Dan, the higher factor, who came to the Port Minister after working under Mr. Obaida in the fishing.
"As there been a question discussed in the course of these phones, the development of the trade policy?", asked Commissioner Anthony Willy, Mr. Tripody.
“No”, answered Mr. Tripody. —
I can't remember what I was talking about, but it was definitely not that.
Not between me and Mr. Obad.
According to the highly established factor, Israeli military aircraft attacks targets within Syria
The High-Administrative of the Fox News Interview confirmed that Israeli military aircraft had hit the target in the Syrian port city of Latvia on Thursday evening.
The factor did not point out that it was for the purpose, but he said at least one.
Asoshithed Press reports that the rackets of the Russian production SA-125 were targeted.
At least two times ago this year, Israel was carrying aircraft with rackets inside Syria.
Foreign slaves on sub-category 457 visums may be tested for “depreciation”
The ‘dependence’ test for foreign slaves under class 457 has been examined by the Government, as it intends to enlarge repressive measures.
This test will, in the case of its adoption, apply to the criteria aimed at preventing the use of Class 457 visa to fill non-qualified debts or as a laze for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The document presented by the Government for discussion was repeated today, while the former lebory deputat was decreased by the Government of foreign slaves, saying that it could damage the neighbors of Australia.
"Great statements of the type "foreigners at the end of the series" and "sna" of the Australian people are a very disappointment for the time when the professionals needed a protected labour market," she said to the Australian Institute today.
Historyly, this means that the white work was to be protected, and if some in the region saw the votes of this historical artefact, I would not be surprised.
The document presented is 12 measures which have been considered before by the former immigration ministers of Chris Bowen.
Brandan O'Connor, the Ministry of Immigration in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met the official counterparts of people, has already made five of the recommended changes and the rest are in the stage of consideration.
If the ‘dependence’ criteria are adopted, the applicant may investigate whether the candidate is authentic in the conditions where the candidate is a family or a nearly known owner or person concerned with the company ' .
Undertakings may also need to be reported by the number of owners of sub-class 457, since the companies intended to sponsor a small number of persons then received a hundred.
Meanwhile, the 35-year-old Sri Lanki, seeking a refuge, died probably from the infarct after the arrival of a ship with refugees to Christmas Island this week.
The killed nine-year-old son of this man followed him on the way to Australia, and since his father's death in the middle of him, a two-year-old brother who was also on the board of the ship.
The Australian authorities quickly sent a man to Christmas’s hospital where he died.
The friend of Samena Varlamova said that hokeist suffers from alcoholism
The friend of the Hockeist Seed of Varlamo of Vavrinuk stated that he suffers from alcoholism, transmits Russian newspapers.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said a woman, in particular.
On the fact that Vabrinuk was sent to the court for the killing of a colliper of Russian Samena Varlamova, which also was a member of the Colorado club.
According to her, the chokeist took her off for her hair and struck her - after her attack, her hands, her breast, her life and her neck were hurt.
Varlam himself came with Denver ' s half and admitted to the detailed detailed description of what was happening.
He was arrested, but later he was released for $5,000.
The Court did not hold a sportsman in the country's movements, but prohibited to approach Vabrinuk.
He also threatened the possible conclusion for six years of domestic violence.
The Government of the United Kingdom announced an investigation aimed at enhancing the economic effect of Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
Project HS2 provides for the opening of a high-effective report with Scotland and North England, starting in 2026
The Baronesa Transport Minister Kramer noted that the project "combines the United Kingdom".
The Ministry of Transport of Scotland, Kit Brown, said that he was “in an excitement” from a planning work with the Government of the United Kingdom.
The first stage will be in the building of a new high-economic railway line between London and West Midland.
When the second step is finished, the lines will be proposed in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government reviewed the estimated rate of the high-capacity building between London and North England from 32.7 to 42.6 billion billion.
The Government of the United Kingdom, which has been negotiated with the Transport of Scotland, ordered HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the travelability of the railway and reduction of the duration of the train for North England and Scotland.
This must include the opportunity to overcome the way from Glasgo and Edinburgh to London in three or less hours.
Baronessa Kramer said, "Our objective for HS2 is to create a current national network that will make British and its cities closer to each other."
We develop HS2 because the benefits that it will bring are great.
Without him, we will face the crisis of the travel ability in our railway network.
But also about the transport of cities; throughout the United Kingdom, 18 cities, including Glasgo and Edinburgh, will receive a better message through HS2.
The Scottish Secretary Alister Carmickle added: "This is the most recent announcement of the good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Swedish Government, Kit Brown invited Mr. Carmaycla to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-economic railway has all opportunities to bring great economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general argument for the high-economic railway throughout the United Kingdom."
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the Government of the Great Britain to consider the options of building a high-scale railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the rail line of Glasgo, Edimburg, which the Switzerland Government already plans.
I am deeply waiting for an examination of the results of the British Ministers in the year and for a joint decision on steps.
Tory is the new hope of nuclear energy?
Governments in the countries of the world continue to think about how to ensure energy needs.
The burning of waters (where they are) affects climate negatively.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Atomic energy is covered without the other, but it remains after itself a mass of losses.
Recently, scientists focused on the Tory - another radioactive element of the Mandaleva system.
He is meeting throughout the world, and, as the experts acknowledge, his discharge will not remain in residues that must be kept for age.
Regulations on electronic aircrafts in Australia until they remain in force
The passengers of the Australian aircraft will also need to disable their plans and smartphones during the aircraft and the aircraft, despite measures in the United States on the regulations, the data of the devices.
The United States Federal Aviation Management allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers could read electronic books, watch video or play games on their devices during the aircraft and station, so that they will stay in the "Rayim Airport".
Passovers can do this already during the main part of the floor, but many disappoint that they do not have access to their electronic books during the aircraft and station.
The Australian carriers consider this decision required by the American aircraft to carry out a large number of works to meet new requirements, but showed that they were not planning to change their procedures in the nearest future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they considered this statement, but stressed that the use of electronic equipment in the critical phases of the aircraft remained in Australia.
“The Office of Civil Airport Safety has currently no rules for regulating the use of electronic devices in the aircraft”, stated it.
This issue is regulated by rules required by air transporters to ensure safety at any time, and from passengers to respect the safety rules they communicate by the team members.
Virgin, who had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Office the extension of the use on the board of its Wi-Fi distraction system, was not against changes, but said that it would follow the ruler's instructions.
"We would welcome the review of the Civil Aviation Safety Office of the issue of authorisation of electronic devices because we really think that it would improve the quality of customers' services now when it is on our aircraft (the shipless distraction system)," said the press secretary.
Qantas stated that the current rules would be held.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during the airport and the station, and at the next time we are not planning to change it," she said.
The FAU is distributed to American aircraft companies.
However, we are always interested in regular changes that could benefit passengers, and we will, of course, consider carefully the FAU decision and the causes that cause it.
The impact of the aircraft to the aircraft will be determined for the U.S. carriers and will depend on the age of their airport.
The carriers must prove that their aircraft is sustainable to mobile devices, and to review facilities, training materials, manuscript and passenger transport standards.
“When the aircraft will check and confirm its floor's sustainability, it may allow passengers to gain portable, electronic equipment such as plans, electronic books and smartphones at any height”, stated the FAU.
In rare cases of bad vision, the equipment will indicate passengers to disable their devices during the placement.
Furthermore, the recommendations of the group are more difficult to be resolved under the seats or in the baggage seats during the aircraft and station.
The Chapter of Dagestan will hear the extremism notes in Cubani
The football catch between Anji and Cubanya was a political college between the authorities of the Crossnodar Country and Dagestan after the hospitals burned the Dagestan flag, and Cubani's himn sounded differently.
The Chapter of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipo on Thursday proposed the replies to the parliamentaries of the Court, because the Middle of the Crossnodar Country calls for international differences, in particular, calls for war with "basurmans".
Take the Hymn of the Crossnodar End, which has been approved in 1995.
It's a shame, and no one's doing it.
"Remembering you here as the mother of the family, of the basurmanin, we go to a battle" -- for which these words are recorded in the gimnage, to throw some believers in other believers," he expressed solidarity with the Abdulatian president of the parliament of Hizri Shishisaidi.
Putin has been punished for his friend Asad
And now, the news of the ocean, which is from Syria, where, as we have been present today, Israel hit the Russian production rackets, which, according to the reports, were designed "Hezball".
Today, Syria has performed a significant role - to make its production of aircraft by 1 November.
This was made in the framework of the agreement that was made by Russia and the United States allowed to not carry out military opponents to which they had reached this summer.
More details about the weapons and what all this means for the Syrian President, our Master Correspondent Richard Engel will explain.
Washington said that Asa's regime would be punished for this.
More than 1400 peaceful inhabitants, including hundreds of children, were lost in August from a gas-reducing.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombs, but in the form of a transaction made by the friend Asada - Vladimir Putin.
Syria will be rejected from his him of weapons to the middle of the year.
And today, it's a important thing.
The Group of Experts reported that Syria had brought from the building stated hydrocarbon production factories.
The more long-term and harder task is to have a tone of arms and components to it.
As we understand, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington said that Asa's days were counted.
I think Asad's gonna have to go.
The question is not whether this will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer stuck and has to leave.
But Asad's staying.
And it feels more confident.
His army continues to use artillery, rackets and napalms.
His opponents are uncombined and wrongly invasive.
His people have to leave their homes, many hunger.
Some have to eat with papers and bags.
Many believe that Bashar Assad has avoided punishment for massive murder.
The arms agreement calls the success of the duplicate, the Nobel Prince of the world, and the Ahasdad himself made the impression of a man ready to cooperate.
Today, the United States employee in Syria has had to respond to simple questions in Washington.
When the child goes hungry, his mother is almost worse than that he was not killed by a weapon.
Asad's staying.
And it changes the weapons to power.
The Chairman of the RF has created a great Ministry of Construction and the ICH
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin created a new Ministry for Building and ICH and proposed to submit to the ex-governmentary of the Ivan area of Michail Menu during the personal meeting.
The Chairman met Michal in the residence in New Orleans, and Menne refused to revoke the new community.
The Press Secretary of Russian President Dmitriy Peskov explained that all the functions of building and JKH are going to the new Ministry of Minergion.
Michael Menn, the son of the Orthodox priest of Alexander Me, completed the Moscow Institute of the Gubkin’s Oil.
Since 1995, his political career was started - he had chosen in the Moscow regional word from the Serbia-Posada, a Deputy of the State Duma, the first vice-premier of the Government of Moscow, the vice-premier of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Michael Menj was Governor of the Ivan area.
Lombard owners in Singapore do well while the average class is difficult
In a lombard in the Bendemire trade center in Singapore, Janny Amirthaling, he places a golden brush, ring and series in order to pay his daughter's school training.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is placed there," says Ms. Amirthaling.
Although she won $3000 ($2400) per month as a administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Actually, in various parts of South-East Asia, the question is where the debt of households is that ValueMax, where it is committing its debt, is the third debt registered on the Singapore Foundation.
The credit for juvenile products is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthhaling), but almost like unsecure bank credits.
Normally, in Singapore, lobbys calculate the effective annual rate of 17 per cent, less than 15,4 per cent of the United Overseas Bank, a branch officer in the same trade center.
The lobbys, however, have the privilege that they do not require credit checks or payment proofs and can provide credits more rapidly than banks.
Thus, millions of people throughout the region are in a lobby, since families feel pressure because of the increase in life rate and the rapid increase in domestic debts and consumer debts.
After five years of sustainable growth followed by the world financial crisis, and demanded credits, a free monetary and credit policy in developed economy countries is addressed in the low and average income familys to compensate the reduction of income as the growth of their economy is slow.
This week Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, showed an increase in the family credit range, mainly because of the growth of the hypotheke, as a risk factor for the credit efficiency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest proportion of households to a wave internal product in Asia.
Malaysia listed this list from 80% of the BDP compared to 60% in 2008.
Economys are also covered by a high level of consumer in Thailand, which has been out of technical recession on this week.
On Thursday, data showed continuous reduction in exports and weakness of consumer query.
“Now, with the increase in prices of people in the middle and lower [income scales], they will seek ways to fill their income where they are just smoke”, says Sung Seng Won, the CIMB economy, of the Malaysia bank.
Recordly high prices for gold in the last two years have strengthened the speed that people have set up their similar things, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family beauty.
In Singapore, approximately 70 per cent of the items found in 200 lofty cities of the town of the city, I have been used with gold.
The people say, "The price of gold looks good, let us put the golden cup of the grandfather, and we will return it in a month."
In Thailand, the largest lombard operator EasyMoney has observed the increase in the number of customers using it in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in a lofty bishop is that ValueMax, a Bendemire operator and 15 other in Singapore, plans to expand not only in the neighboring Malaysia, where he has four stores but also in Asia, says Jaah Le Ching, Executive Director ValueMax.
The company will enhance 60 per cent of the S$66 million, which would result in the distribution of actions at the Singapore Foundation.
While some creditors have caused a cry for high rates, Mrs. Yeah says that the lombard does not only make more deep tariffs than other creditors, it does not also increase directly.
“Clients establish the subjects they already possess, and the mobilization of similar assets does not increase the debt of households”, says she.
The resource is obtaining more public recognition as a means to obtain short-term enforcement.
And not only the categories of people who are in a difficult financial position are used.
The rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax by establishing golden clothes or Rolex hours, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchasing prices available.
We see clients from all the layers of society.
“They include status persons who need to take money for a short term for commercial projects or investments, or for a small business, which must overcome temporary daily difficulties,” says Mrs. Jeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not important for the population to be a number of names and their status, but the quality of medical assistance.
The implementation of the Programme for the Reforming of the Health of the Turkey for 2011-2013 will allow the restructuring of our town ' s medical medical assistance to the population, including geneological diseases, genealogic and birthdays.
Thus, after the conjunction with the hormone, there was a greater opportunity to draw closer experts from the NHCB Guide for consultations with various pathologies, to complement the investigation based on the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernisation programme, the material-technical base of the family was significantly improved, and there was a modern equipment corresponding to world standards.
For these years, there were approximately 8 million rubles to the capital reparation of locations, obtained 112 units of equipment at a sum of 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment is a intense post for newborn.
In the operation of the Caesar of the Seal Seaver, it is used to collect blood from the operating ran and after the special return of its birthday, avoiding the transfusion of strange blood.
Modern equipment have also been established by clinical diagnosis diagnosis.
In the Women ' s consultation, the electronic registration works, and the introduction of electronic cards and the history of patients ' illness is quickly planned in the future.
The development of the telemedicin has made the possibility of consulting geneological diseases, breast-feeding, birthdays and newborn professionals.

Package of measures of $325 million for the health of Tasmania
The Federal Government claims that the package was saved by $325 million for a weak health system of Tasmany will be supplemented by serious conditions that guarantee that the Government would not deduce the resources.
The Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Society is taking “necessary measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the age of the population of this island, a higher level of chronic diseases and systems.
The decision on the employment during four years was taken after the Government ' s consultations with the independent Deputy of Tasmany Andrew Wilki.
"The Commission has proposed a package of external rescue measures that, we believe, will solve specific problems that stand before the state," Mrs. Pliberseck said today.
The 325 million dollar packaging includes $31 million per blending campaign on planning operations.
Another 2600 operations, including ortopedics and catactates, will help to overcome relief.
There are also money for a clinic that takes hospitals without preliminary record in Hobart and London, to increase the quality of login after stationary, training of medical experts, health protection services and electronic medical card systems in hospitals.
"These investments will come to the stated forward doctors of the idea of how to help the Tasmanian health system better," Mrs. Pliberseck said.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work in a close statement and responsibility.
The State will need to support the current levels of funding in order to obtain the Union's monetary funds, and to report each month where it will treat these funds.
The Commission of three persons will be established to ensure that the State provides services as effective and more effective.
Mr. Wilky said today that $325 million would not decide anything, "if they were not followed by a true reaction that would set the Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable basis."
However, he thanked the Government for the answer to his request for emergency assistance that he first addressed to the Prime Minister at beginning of May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to the conclusion of the health system of this State from the critical state," said Mr. Wilky.
According to the State Government, these additional election procedures are significantly compensating recent reductions.
However, the Federal Opposition Representative for Health Datton believes that today's statement is a "decision, an analogue leucoplaster".
"The reason why we are here is that the Leborist Government has expelled $430 million from the health system," he said the ABC TV television.
When the State government is borrowing almost half billion dollars and the Society contributes to 300 million, it is to assume that it is good news.
Mr. Datton asked Mrs. Pliberseck to ensure that no dollars of the package will be lost in additional bureaucracy.

Syria has set up its means to produce aircraft, says a group of observations
Syria had the main equipment for the production of air-equipment and gas-equipment, stated a international monitoring group on Thursday, while heavy crowds were busted north of the country, near one of the objects, which, as they think, were stored.
Thursday, the Syrian group of activists also stated that more than 120 000 people were killed from the beginning of civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
Declaration of the Organization for the Prohibition of Armed Weapons was made within one day before
the term of 1 November established by this organization based in Gaague to make Damascus or "not up" all means of production of air and mechanisms to mix chemical arts with the receipt of gas and to fill them with warfare.
The conclusion of what is at the main stage of the Property is an important part in the ambushic graph, which aims to set up all the wall of Damascus at the middle of 2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can't produce a new hemic weapons anymore.
Nevertheless, Damascus has still to be initiated by the weapons and stocks.
The country seems to have approximately 1000 metrical tonnes of chemical arts and weapons, including heat gas and nervous-paralytic gas sorcerin.
This statement was made during the wounded fights on Thursday in Safira, where experts viewed that there was an object on the production of aircraft, as well as its storage, reported by the Syrian Centre of Human Rights in Britain.
The group of activists who followed the loss of the network of activists in Syria stated that 120 296 were killed on Thursday.
As told, 61 067 are civilians, including 6365 children.
From the Government, the group said that 29 954 people I was members of the armed forces of President Bashar Asad, 18 678 I was the managing fighters and 187 Lebanon warriors of Hezbolla.
The dead also, as stated in the statement, were 2202 military crowds and about 5375 opposition warriors, many of them foreigners.
According to the United Nations evaluation of 25 July, 100 000 were lost in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated from that point.
The conflict forced approximately 2 million people to flee from the country.
Asada's army fought a few weeks in Saphira with rebels, many of them were with the Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were victims from both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The fights highlighted the danger of the inhibitors on the aircraft undergoing their compressed time of Syrian mission to be delivered from the tox of the arsenal in the destruction of the continuing civil war.
The OSHO statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “now satisfied with the verification and verification of all of Syrian stated critically important products and equipment for mixing/making”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the in-towers claimed that they had completed the first checking course, visiting 21 of the 23 objects declared to Damascus.
They were not able to visit two areas from the security views, and they declared the in-towers.
On Thursday, the OSHO stated that both of the places were, according to Syria's statement, “the objects of the aircraft programme that are in them were moved to other stated places that were checked”.
It was not possible to figure out whether there was one of the two objects in Safer who were not able to visit the OECD.
Syria has planned to complete its arms, which should be held by the Executive Committee of OSHO in a month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you all have demonstrated in the implementation of the most complex mission that has ever been undertaken by this organization”, said the Director-General of the Achmet Usumju group's observation in the commentary on the OECD.
In the third year, civil war has brought up rebels, in particular Muslim-Sunnites, with the Government of Asad and its security forces, which are members of the Sect of the Lawyers, the response of the Shiit Islam.
What happens to other events, the resident of the Centre of Rami Abdurrahman said that there was a middle-explosion of the VOC in the neighboring province of Syria Latvia.
The reason of the explosion is not, he said.
Anger because of the sentence to the terrorist terrorist in Bali
The remaining in the lives and families of 202 killed by the explosion of bombs in Bali in 2002 in an irritated reaction to the sentence, you were the last of the prosecutors presented before the court and said Umar Patek should be shot.
The Pateque, who had spent almost 10 years of running, as one of the most distracted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years of freedom for its role in the creation of explosive devices used during the terrorism.
It may be released for 15 years if it receives a term-term release.
The 45-year-old sentence was recognized to be guilty of massive murders due to the attack of two night clubs in the Pope tourist in the Cut area, where 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and there were still tens.
It was also recognised to be guilty of a number of other accusations with terrorism, including in the explosion of the Church throughout Indonesia in the Canon of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors need a lifetime, although they could say that a person called “substitutor” for its order should be sentenced to the penalty of the master for the manufacture of explosive devices.
This decision destroyed the painful memories of the mother from Perta June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old Jane and Jenny's neighbors in the teracte of Patec and his partners nearly ten years ago.
She almost kept the tears and said that Pateck had to be sentenced to a punishment.
"I really think he should follow the steps of other guys.
It must be presented before the distressing team, " said Mrs. Cortin AAP.
I must live every day, knowing that I have no sons anymore, and I will not see my daughters."
The Sarai club was disrupted when the massive explosive device was introduced in the parked outside of the car, which was after 11th evening of 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was in the "Paddy" bar, where the terrorist shooted a fucking explosive, just 20 seconds ago.
After that, he fell into the moon and “dead” three times, being connected to the system of life insurance.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share three other members of the terrorist of James Islamian cell, responsible for the blood battle, Amrozi, Muchlas and Hama Samura, who were punished four years ago.
Actually, this guy deserves a punishment more than all.
Save his life, well, there's no reason to keep his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds is not so much.
Pateck is the last of the terrorists in Bali before the court.
He was hidden for almost ten years, but finally was arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistan City of Abbottabad, where the American army killed the former captain of Al-Qaida Usama Ben Laden less than four months later.
In the proceeding of the judicial proceedings, the FBI showed that the information was testified: Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in trying to restore connections between South-East Asia and Al-Kaida.
"He didn't give it," Mrs. Cortin said.
In recent times, he did not regret how bad he had caused others.
The sentence was made before the 10th anniversary of the terrorist, which will be noted later in Bali and Australia this year.
"This year will be a lot of tears," says Mrs. Cortin.
Pateck can still complain about his sentence.
FAU: "Awastic passengers can now use aircraft boys (but don't call from the phone)"
Aeroplanes are able to use their electronic devices throughout the aircraft to read, work, play games, watch the movies and listen, but not speak on mobile phones, which are the long-term new routes held by the Federal Aviation Management on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
As soon as such a change is made, it will be warned depending on the aircraft, said FAU's Officer Michael Wart at the press conference.
Aeroplanes have to show the FAU how their aircraft is responsible for new principles and that they update their learning facilities for the members of the year equipped and the rules on the disposal to conform to the new principles.
The FAU stated that it had already received plans from certain aircraft companies to enhance the use of portrait electronic devices in the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the aircraft companies that had already planned.
"On the basis of the plan, we could approve the extension of the use of electronic devices very quickly," said the FAU.
Now passengers are obligation to lock their smartphones, planches and other devices as only the door of the airport is closed.
They should not be restarted until the plane has a height of 10 000 feet and the captain will not give ".
The passengers must disable their devices again when the aircraft is decreased and not included until the plane is on earth.
In addition to new rues, aircraft companies whose aircrafts are appropriately protected from electronic mixtures may allow passengers to use these devices during the aircraft, aircraft and road, stated the FAU.
Most new aircrafts and other aircrafts that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high levels, as expected, respond to these criteria.
Laura Glaying, President of the Professional Board Leader Association, welcomed these changes.
“When the new policy will be made well (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier to achieve it), it will be an unexpected option,” said Gladeding.
We have openly deceived to feel the "dejury on school" when the matter comes to this issue.
The Agency reported, however, the connection to the Internet for the service, the exchange of emails, the text or the loading of data will be prohibited at less than 10 000 feet height.
The passengers will be proposed to change their smartphones, tables and other devices into the aircraft.
Thus, there are still no “Free Words” — the intellectual Internet game in which Alex Boldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when the event occurred: the actor was removed from the American Airlines Airlines aircraft for refusing to disable the device when the aircraft was located on the airport.
And more hard devices, such as machines, will still need to be placed in the baggage, because they can traumaticly travel someone if they are flying throughout the salon.
The phone calls on the plane will also be continued to be banned.
Regulatory powers on phone calls belong to the Federal Communication Commission, not FAU.
The FAU may reduce the prohibition of some electronic devices during the aircraft and station
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transport Safety Council, the national CBS News Transport Safety Expert, stated that modern phones are still considered a risk.
"Social phones are really a problem, not only because they can be able to create spaces for navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCS that they can create mixtures for a center connection when the airplane is in the air," Rosenker said.
The Advisory Committee established by the FAU for the study of this issue was recommended last month to allow the Government to enable the use of personal electronic devices to be larger.
The FAU pressure has increased in recent years in order to reduce their use.
Critici, such as the democracy Senator of Missouri Claire Kaskyl, claim that there are no real reasons for the prohibition of security.
The compliance with the provisions is also more difficult, since the use of the devices has become global.
Researchs have been able to forget or ignore the instructions to disable their devices before the third passengers.
The FAU started using electronic devices in 1966 in response to the reports on navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry with FM radio recipients, high-technological garages at that time.
New aircrafts are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developing and approving the FAU as sustainable to electronic mistakes.
Aeroplanes have passengers using Wi-Fi at the Crayer Height for several years.
Aeroplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more sustainable to mixtures.
The depressive majority of the layers are the advantage of the use of electronic devices as a new rue, said Wart.
Today's electrical devices usually cause radio signals much less power than the previous generation of devices.
E-book reading devices, for example, are only minimized when translating pages.
But the signals become stronger when the devices are threatened or sent.
Amazon.com was among those who had been able to use electronic devices.
In 2011, the company's representatives charged the whole aircraft with their devices for reading the Kindle E-books and flying on it to verify the issues, but did not find them.
Members of the FAU Advisory Committee have expressed mixed feelings as regards whether the application of devices is any risk.
Douglas Kiddd from the National Aeroplane Association stated that he considers a mixture of devices real, even if the risk is a minimum.
Other members of the committee said that there were only pilot reports from where they confirmed that the devices could create mixtures for aircraft systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAU allow the pilots to require the passengers to disconnect devices during the installation under adequate visibility.
The group of tourist representatives of the industry welcomed these changes calling them a healthy step to meet passengers now using technological devices.
"We are glad that the FAU admits that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with security and protection," said Roger Dou, Director-General of the United States Association.
Schools of figs will conduct tests for the receipt of driver rights
Guidelines are fit to take private companies owned by their own computerized autodrome.
This is the "Commissary" reported on the project of the Government ' on the management of vehicles.
According to the newspaper, in Russia, only about 30 such cars are now.
It is supposed that such "privileged" car schools will calculate the results of internal testing.
In this regard, the Gusabto Inspection will monitor the delivery of tests every half years.
If more than 30 per cent of the theoretical tests and more than 20 per cent of students are not delivered for the first time, this school will have no privileges for a half-year.
Technical requirements for autodromes contained in the Government's establishment project shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The project also contains the requirements for training of a two-score technology.
Since 1 January 2015, the owners of the moto for the rights of category A shall have to be tested under urban movement.
Furthermore, since 5 May 2014, the company has not been able to take foreign leaders with foreign rights.
Such persons will have to receive Russian rights after the trial.
A bird broad on air to a safe place from the northern sea's storm installation is released back to wild nature
The bird that was broke on air to Âg after it was found in the east state on the oil upstairs of the North Sea was released back to wild nature.
This water shepherd was placed in the hotel of Aberdin last month, and then the Scotch Community ' s initiative to prevent cruel treatment of animals (SPCA) in the rescue of the Centre of Alloa.
The manager of the Centre of Colin Seddon said, "This is a water shepherd, mostly a winter migrant from the North Sea, which fell into the area of the heavy winds over the North Sea."
It seems that the bird was stuck and smoke to find a escape on the oil height.
He added: "He was not able to fly again, so they turned to us for help."
The water shepherd was healthy and good until he was released.
Are Elite ready for business with England?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the obligation to collect business representatives and to determine what changes the United Kingdom makers and slaves want to see in the EU.
For this purpose, we have ordered the largest and most complete question of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about Britain, Biz and the EU.
YouGov's company asked over 1000 business leaders representing a wide range of business in Britain for sizes, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the question will be unexpected for many.
We have discovered that most of the undertakings are currently able to be exported for certain parts by giving attention to the countries who have modernization and will be able to acquire while the EU countries are in the stage.
They want the Government to give the priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil and not to lose time for EU institutions and a difficult process of reform.
When they were asked about their opinions on specific political issues, from antimonopole to production laws, most business leaders believed that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
The general deficit was present to the single market, while the representatives of the business claimed that the expenditures from the regulation from Brussels are now transferring advantages from the marketing area -- even 40 per cent of major undertakings, traditionally the most evidence of all companies.
The latest and most evident thing is that our question of business operators has found that the majority of the Great Britain wants to take a course to change the agreement and to the EU's trade, not political.
This result, which was observed among the enterprises of all sizes and largest business groups, shows that the business is “a significant change” that will return powers to Britain.
High taxes are the achievement of amendments in the Treaty and more beneficial provisions for the United Kingdom will ensure a 16-percent movement in voting for remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this question shows that the British business supports its plan of revision of the United Kingdom membership in the EU.
He also shows that business expects that revision will lead to a significant movement in the current balance of forces to the United Kingdom.
The best conditions for the British business are and become more effective as the area comes to a more closer economic and financial union.
The priority should be given to slave sites and economic growth in Britain, and, as the results of our investigation are, it means to increase the focus on trade and the change in Brussels ' normal activities.

Snowboarder for Olympical Buyer Special graph of
The Russian bank has released a memory banknote in the middle of Sochi, where the Olympian games will pass in the winter.
The name of the buyer is 100 rubles.
However, bloggers have already been actively ironised by memory banknotes.
Following the presentation of the Olympic Buyer on 30 October, they noted that the snowboardist image could be found in banks.
In particular, StockExchange is in free storage, where this graph is dated in 2005.
The same graph is used in the Photoshop lesson on the Russian site Megaobzor on 18 January 2011.
Moreover, it has already been spent in the reklame of Smartphones RugGear.
The Olympic banknote has been completed in a blue-ground gamma.
On the one hand, the snowboardist flying over Sochi, and the other is the species of the Olympic Stadium and the Jar-Pitice.
The designer of banknotes is Paul Bushuev, who wins competition among the students of the Sankt Peterburg Academia of Arts of the Name of Repine.
The presentation noted that several species of horn, frartil, and trampline sticks were considered, but the snowboard was finally chosen because it was a very young species.
According to the source " Reports", close to the CB, the regulator does not consider the public a widespread distribution of the Snowboardist with the Olympian banknotes and are now studying the situation.
And this is not too quiet in Goznaka with a brush around the Olympian banknote.
The Press Service Holder of Natalia Nikiforov said to the Reports that all the opinions of the plague are funny.
The banknotes' Snowboardist will return to the right, on the graphs on the network - left, - pointed out Nikiforov.
A person at the session for the creation of the purchases was recorded from different points, then a final image was selected, characterized outside the snowboardist.
She also noted that copyright laws were not distributed to the Olympic banknote, since the artist had received the payment for.
Experts believe that the debate around the Olympical Buyer and all of it is discussed.
Awareness on the purchase, plus for its movement, considers the Executive Director of the NP "RusBrand" Alexy Popoličev.
It is sufficiently difficult to demonstrate the 100 percent comparison of images on the purchases and banks, so the needs to promote intellectual property for this image may not be done.
The first Olympical banknote appeared in China - to the Olympics game in Peking in 2008 was issued in 10 June.
Russia decided to support this tradition.
The law of prohibitions made the Russian to drink less bird
The Russian birds have a bad attitude.
According to their delays, the consumption of beer in the country in the future year will remain at the previous level, in the best case.
Although businessmen were primarily calculated for growth.
Since the current year is not possible for them: 7 percent sales.
All of this was the head of one of the largest beer companies of the country, the president of the Council of the Russian Birds, Isaac Sheps, at the third annual Conference of the Adam Smith Institute of the " Construction of All-Sect Question in Russia", which was just completed in Moscow.
It was discussed by the public market regulation.
Since 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has been decreased to 18 per cent, since in the last years, the increase in the regulation of beer growth in the production and beer traffic - drinking with small alcohol content has been observed, shepherds reported.
There is no such harmful beer market in any country in the world that is unpredictable to introduce all new and new non-logical prohibitions that are based on the fight against alcohol abuse.
The beer has visited that many laws of prohibitions to reduce the alco-usage levels have no effect, however, all new initiatives are continually present.
More sickly, the beer producers have struck those introduced since this year, the prohibition of sale of spirals in kiosca.
"We have lost 35,000 consumers," said Isaac Sheps.
Two predicts for the future year in the birds.
The optimist is the one of Sheps: the sales of pen drinks will be maintained at the previous level.
Pessimists are still 2-3 percent.
In order to keep their arrival, businessmen have to go away from the mass consumer's mass, in the "premium" class: the beer will be less, but it will be worth more.
Yet, radical consequences from the fall of the sale with a small quantity of spider are not yet seen.
"My observations, the level of alcoholism disease remains at the same level," reported the doctor of Alexandria City.
True, the number of sick people who use strong drinks, as well as those who "seat" on spiral tonic beverages like Yaguar, as well as ten years ago, had exactly a "beer" alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were released from the "Ford" car in University.
As it is said in the promotions, all the discharged have received compensations.
However, as far as the problems of the slaves, the issue of reduction in the region is to be raised.
At the meeting, the Deputy of the Regional Zacsa Alexy Etmanov stated that 600 people were reduced by the Ford company at University.
According to his statement, this occurred in September: then, by the voluntary release programme, which was once with the organization's promotion, approximately 600 people went out of the bathroom.
Workers who decided to release their own volunteer were proposed for " gold parachutes" in several places.
Because of this, most of them left slave places for their own will.
But it says that the number of people is a whole night change.
I don't think that's going to happen.
However, within the nearest two years, the authorities are not planning to adopt any programmes of support for regional undertakings which are in difficult position," he explained, adding that the Government does not take account of the stagnation of production in the region and a great reduction of slaves.
Ford's not supporting or confirming this information.
We're waiting for the company's answer, and as soon as it appears, we'll oblige it.
Discussions about the reduction of slaves in Ford's forest in University have come a long time.
So, for example, 600 people have been released on the company's plans in September.
An earlier engine has stated that car production was detained.
As a reason for the bathroom, the question was called "Ford" in Russia.
According to Petrostat, the volume of industrial production in Lenoblasta was decreased by 5.4 per cent during nine months of 2013.

In the United States, mobies can be used during the aircraft and aircraft
The new rules for the safety of mobile devices during the aircraft and aircraft are approved in the United States, reported by the BBC.
As expected, the American aircraft companies will allow passengers to be held by smartphones and plans during the entire flight, and new rules will begin until the end of 2013.
Nevertheless, a connection with the Internet to receive and send electronic mail will be prohibited during flights at 3 km higher.
Because of the risk of the radio-building mixture of aircraft, this voting connection will still be prohibited.
Thus, aircraft passengers will allow reading electronic books, playing games on the tables and other newspapers and seeing videos during the internal and/or roads.
Before the rules are adopted, the aircraft will be required to verify the safety of the use of electronic devices during the flight.
Furthermore, aircraft companies should convince the federal administration of the United States civil aviation that they are involved in coping with the proposed impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft management equipment.
According to the source, for example, the United States, can also be revised by the standards for electronic aircraft.
For the "Russian Mafia" in the United States, the new name was "Bratski Circle"
This week, the black list of "Russian mafia" in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The United States Finance Minister introduced three Russian representatives, two Uzbekistan citizens and Israel.
One of the Russians was a singer of Gregory Leps, which the United States are suspicious of transporting money for grouping members.
However, in the black list of the United States 22 members participating in the " Bratski Circle" and six organizations associated with it.
However, many experts express doubts that such a reality exists.
"The statement of the Bratski Circle" is more likely to try to join different crimes," said an expert on organized crime and Professor of the University of New York Mark Galeotti earlier.
His opinion, "Bratski Circle" reflects the Pope's appreciation of the "Russian Mafia".
"I did not meet anybody in the Russian legal protection authorities or anybody else who would confirm such a crime organization," cited Mr. Galeotty, the American Centre for Research of Corruption and Organizated Crime.
With Mr. Galeotti and Professor of the University of George Mason Liz Shelly.
"If they have a community, it is more like a criminal network but not a body," it says the Centre for the Research of Corruption and Organised Crime.
In the middle of the past year, Mark Galeotti assumed that the "Brat Circle" constituted a more approached Russian fight in the law of Aslana Usoyan, such as Ded Hasan.
The criminal authority was killed in January this year.
So, the activities of Lashi Shushanshvili and Zachary Kalashov, filled with the list in 2012, were closely with Ded Hassan, and another party of the spice, Themury Mirzoev, came to the grandparent of Dad Hassan.
Nevertheless, Mr. Galeotty notes that some persons do not have any respect for Usoyan.
It believes that all of them were more common financial and crimes, such as drug supply from Afghanistan.
In the meantime, the scandal around the inclusion in the "British Circle" Gregory Lepsa, the favorite song of President of Russia Vladimir Pu," draws the attention of Cremela.
Of course, we consider that we will receive more information from our American partners about how such a decision has been made in such cases," said the press secretary of the State of Dmitriy Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a RF citizen.
Like the interests of all RF citizens, its interests will be protected.

Two of YMCAs have been accused of sexual crimes before accusations against Jonathan Lord, as has been reported by the Royal Commission
Two of YMCA NSWs were accused of sexual crimes against children before the commitment in 2011 against the agency for children in Caringbach Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
However, in the introductory statement of the Commission, it stated that “never had sexual violence against children within its organization”.
The Master Executive Director Philip Hair asked about one case when YMCA was accused of crimes with the pornography, and otherwise, when the sporter was sentenced to YMCA Caringbah Hall for sexual crimes against children in 1991.
Mr. Hayer said Gail Ferness, to help the Commission that he knew about the first case, but he did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA also allowed the Commission's introduction intolerance, saying that " YMCA's external checks were recognized that YMCA is in the first series of children's security".
The representatives of the testimony committees say that YMCA was notified that it had received the second of the four of the results of the quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August of that year.
Mr. Hayer, who entered the YMCA, when he was 21 years old, recognized that he also allowed the following leadership to distort the Lord and that he did not have to ensure clear understanding of his commitments, the casca reports on infringements of the child's security policy.
Lord was condemned for sexual crime against 12 boys during two years of his work in YMCA.
He was arrested at least six years of age.
But Mr. Hayer rejected the assumption that YMCA's corporate ethics prevented the reporting of Lord ' s infringements in the field of children ' s security.
The co-operators showed that they were watching mistakes, including that Lord was alone with the children, cared for them personally, sat them on their knees, said he loved one of them and allowed them to play his phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under Lord's direction and asked her to teach her to protect her children because she was inquired of his behavior, witnessed that Jackie Barnat, the care manager of the YMCA children in Caringbah, was the Lord's rule, "very scared and often difficult to access."
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the explanations of the fact that they were strictly informed of the situation to their opposers.
Their friendship with Lord probably led them from the idea of the need to inform him.
Mr. Hayer said that he had submitted to the New South Wales Council of YMCA that a lesson for the organization from “the event with Jonathan Lord” was not “submitting information” by the parties, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hayer stated that the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement after the accusation was adopted by the General Director YMCA on the care of the children of Liam Witley.
He said that it was called to prevent the proof of the exercises, but that was “overcome” and this decision was bad from it.
The YMCA of the New South Wals was not safe for children during the work of Jonathan Lord during 2009-2011, reported to the Commission of Experts on Children's Problems Professor Stephen Smallbon at the University of Griffit.
He said that there were “serious problems” in setting, choice, and habilitating, training and control of the staff.
The debates have been rejected until 20 December.

Look at Jaka, who held a high-level meeting.
Experts of Connoporting Affairs in Cardiff to fight for the Country of the Year, knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the 3-year-old Penton Kirkland.
Not even the schoolman, just for a few months before that, that little boy with his cheat Ponny, Toffy's bridge, was thrown through three tours to easily take the main prize and left 30 adult opponents away behind.
This unseparated couple, the same growth, has received high extent, behavior and style on an annual competition, which is conducted by the centre of the Sannibank horse in Radry near Cardiff.
When he went out to the overall view of the background of men and women in easing chains, he switched his cap and was fiercely running around the two-year Toffy.
The judges praised Fenton for his increasing ability to deal with the wallets during the years.
And Toffy got a higher halt for the look and nature.
Phenton was given to Tophy on his third birthday in March last year, and he was working with the Switzerland Pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffy are a duet."
They had a lot of opponents, but they went out with the golden cube and the cow.
It was only his second statement with Tophy, and we were all in a great way when he won.
The strange people in the arenary thought him to be so phenomenon that they wanted to photograph him.

Mrs. Howells said, "The whole P's been hurt, and they all called to approve votes and votes."
He fled through the sand throughout the length of the aren and, although he looked so small, he did his work.
Fenton without animals — he loves bowls, tractors and farms, and he has two citizens that he forgets.
In view of how he started, he will soon participate in the "Loshadi year", and I am sure he will speak well.
The representative of this annual horse exhibition said, "Fenton is only three years, but he knows how to handle his pony."
But they're a great team.
The judges noted Penton and Toffy for their appearance and how they had been on the show.
They appreciate the satisfaction of the pony and the cluster — Phenton and Toffy were better on the market.
I'm sure Fenton's helped his attractive order, he really looked well in his role.

U.S. Tunnel — Me ́ca for drug transmission equipped by its own railway
One of the most complex tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and the Me has been found by its own systems on relief, ventilation and electricity.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel with a width of four to three feet as one of the most complex secret walks ever found in them.

Professor George Valortigar, neurobiologist at the Trentic University, says: "Hor is that people have a different part of the right and left side of the brain in the form of builders that cause to place or refuse emotions."
Here we tried to look at this and other kinds of things.
He added that as in humans, the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body and the opposite, and two halfs play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how the dogs react to the various sides of other dogs, researchers observed animals when they looked at other dogs films.
They measured the frequency of the heart of animals and analysis of their behavior.
We're probably going to know why their wheels are sometimes moved to one side and sometimes to another.
Professor Vallortigar said, "We showed the dogs video with dogs, or naturalist versions, or force, to be released from any other fashioning factors, and we could manipulate the motion of the wheat and move the wheat to the left or right."
When animals saw that there was nothing to say about a dog that moved the wheat right (with the view of the wheat of the dog), they remained completely disappointed.
But when they noticed that the wheat was inclined towards the left (sounds from the sight of a dog's whistle), their hearts were part of it, and they looked scared.
Professor Vallortigar said he didn't think that dogs had communicated with each other with these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience what moves they should be concerned and what they do not.
He notes: "If there are a few meetings with other dogs and often the wipeling of their wheat on one side is more friendly and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience."
The researchers say that these results can give the owners, veterinarians and drastics a deeper understanding of their animal emotions.
An expert in the conduct of dogs, John Bradshaw, invited for scientists at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first investigation to verify whether it was important for dogs on the left and right side.
Last year, a group of scientists at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turn to the left if they look at an aggressive dog and right to look at a sufficient dog.
And at the other Scientific University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “The dogs are often understood to a dog-work when the wheat was driven to the left and not right, rather than to become anxious, the opposite behavior of the Italian investigation.”
He said that the differences could be because dogs in various studies did not completely accept animals in films or dogs as dogs.
He explained that it could be an investigation of how dogs respond to true dogs.
“When there is enough evidence that two half-shirts of brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified, and dogs are not excluded, ” he said.
However, in view of the easyness that may be registered by, we will probably soon realize why their hairs are sometimes moved to one side and sometimes to another.

Dad Francisk will call the first cardinals in February
Papa Francessk brings the new cardinal catholics of the church first for its service on February 22, as he announced in Vatican on Thursday.
I'm the highest church in the Catholic Church after the papa, and they're electing papa, so Francesco will designate his first group of people who will finally participate in the choice of his recipient.
There's 201 cardinal now.
However, after reaching the 80-year-old cardinal, it can no longer be able to participate in the Pope elections, it is a prerogative group of 120 " electoral cardinals".
By announcing this news, the president secretary of Vatican, Father Federico Lombardy, said that before the ceremonie of the dreaming to the dream, the assembly of all current cardinals will be carried out as a consist.
"Papa Francesc decided to report before his decision to create a consist in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from different angles of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices Organization said that the number of cardinales-electors for February would probably be decreased.
He said that the dad usually calls the cardinals as much as necessary to restore the number of cardinal electors up to 120, as well as the number of cardinals in the age of 80 years as he wants.
The Consistency will have great importance in this year, since it will be the first of the election of France in March this year, according to Valero.
At present, there is a kind of advantage for the benefit of Italy and particularly for Italy.
“I would be interesting in seeing whether the new cardinal papa will be appointed from other world regions to restore the balance,” he said.
In South America, 40 percent of Catholics are resident, but they are represented by a noble number of cardinals.
These will also be the first selected cardinals since the French Cardinal Council is a group of eight cardinals from the world, which is ordered to seek ways to reform the church.
In the past, my dad decided to be self-determined.
"Now Francesk has chosen eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that it would be possible that Francesc would address the cardinals to the Council.
But we were not in such a situation before that, all this was for the first time for us.
Valero said that the dads were usually cardiac episcopes from major income, but the French was "a lot of surprises, so we don't know who he would call."
GM replies to a number of new picapes in the United States for the seat's cup
General Motors Co refers to nearly 19,000 new chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra model 2014 to eliminate the problems with the hand-regulation of the seats, in the reported on Friday by the U.S. regulatory bodies in the field of car transport security.
Some of the pickups may have a defect in the mechanism of the snare.
As a result, seats are not satisfied with the federal standards of auto-transport safety by the staff.
“When the car hits behind, the leader may not properly protect the driver and passengers by increasing the risk of getting a trauma”, stated the National Travel Safety Administration on the Internet.
The repeated models were made from 1 August to 10 September.
The GM picape release started in June and is the most important car rental of the serial production for the leading American car manufacturer from the time of its relocation because of the bankruptcy in 2009.
The GM reported to the pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Travel Safety Administration could not consider the notification to the owners of the 16-day interruption of the Government, which reduced the sale of car in October.
The sales of silverado and Sierra, which were modernized for the 2014 model series, increased by approximately 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 pools Silverado and 16 503 pockets Sierra.
The GM action on the New York Funds Bird on Friday increased by 1.4 per cent before the note of $37.47.
Crying of the Omama Elector's Dispersion
I voted for President Obama twice, dividing the hope of amendments
He states that Obama has allowed the response to the response to the repurchase of the people to have no effort.
The Omstationalism cannot be able to address the problems with the Reformed Ambient Health System, the attacks of non-pilots
The memories on the campaign of Obama in 2008 I have been reminded of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student of the second course of the Harvard University of Medical Faculty.
I'm reading a horrible book these days.
I feel that this book will encourage me in the second course of medical faculty and will resume me the feeling of hope.
It is called "Dragness for Victory", which is a memory of the presidential Barak Obama campaign in 2008.
When I finish writing reports on my patients tonight, and I lie in bed, this book returns me when politics inspired millions of people and the expressions could take a spirit.
Victory on the elections of emergency, and the leading news programmes were paused for the purpose of this historical moment.
My classmates were weeping from joy, and my parents had all the newspapers they could only find.
The white House had to come to the young team of the staff, and the people were ready to change.
During Obama's entry into office in 2008, its support level was 82 per cent.
Then I'll close the book.
The return is currently a bitter wake, as an outcome from the mouth.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem to be a remote memory, a huge reminder of lost opportunities.
For years since I left my first electoral bulletin, changes have really occurred.
That was what I couldn't even do.
I give Obama its great and different achievements, from the adoption of the law on accessible medical assistance to the conclusion of our Iraq military soldiers, the cancellation of the rule "Don't ask, don't speak", the murder of Usama Ben Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the party's scope of blocking is too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, choice of public health and closing the base in Guantanamo among others.
But after an innumerable number of times when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting it from colleagues and companions, I had completed the explanations I could give.
I've reached the political discouragement point.
The Ombudsman's reprisonism cannot explain the permission of hearing foreign leaders or the attack of unfaithless persons in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the privacy of the Americans by the National Security Agency or the persecution of disabilities that reveal the government ' s irregularities.
He cannot explain the murder of the American citizen Anvar al-Aulaki without courts and consequences or non-compliance with the limits of public employment and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justifie the conclusions of the report in which it states that the effort of the White House to make MMI quiet, I am being “agressive only from the time of Nixon's administration”.
And at the last time, he cannot justifie that the simple website is not possible for more than three years after signing the Medical Assistance Act.
I don't know if I had to wait for that.
Did I have 18 years of age to understand that the guide could oppose the political campaigns he had before?
It is obvious that the election work is not a predicted programme, since our public dialogue will be a oppositional political party and events such as fear in Newtown.
However, all of my above examples show that they were a significant choice of the administration.
And that's what makes me worry most.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm by his candidate.
Our Romani was an incomprehensible and incomprehensible alternative, and it seemed not to be able to make a decision on its own policy or views.
I believed that during my second time of Obama, being free of pressure for future elections, it justified the hopes we have heard for such a long time.
However, when the review of Obama was less than 45 per cent on this week, it became much more difficult to return in 2008 through this book.
This causes me to take care of many promises that have been flying.
On this week, I read the part of the book described as Clintons had caused Obama to be an enormous damage on the original elections in Pen-Vania.
At an analysis of reasons of mistakes, he told his people that they should return to the normal wall and remain faithful to their goals.
“I want us to return to the attractiveness, ” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
Five years ago, Mr. President, and I'm perfectly with you.
The opinions expressed in this comment belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer states that the Deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the department of a child's release.
Deputat billioner Clive Palmer says that the Premier Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interests in the issue of release for the child, because his daughters can be changed from this benefit.
It made this statement when he tried to avoid whether he had a conflict.
The Joint Partie of Palmer may control up to four votes in the senate, which may be determined to make decisions on the cancellation of emissions in the country and on the top-up activity.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that the conflict of interest could only be with the ministers, and said that Mr. Ebbot's daughters would be in the victory of political measures.
"He has a major conflict of interests when the pleasure and the payment of a child's retirement, because if any of these daughters change, he will have a direct interest in whether or not, they will be released or not," Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after election, the election committee officially announced Mr. Palmer to be winner in the fight against the location of Sanshin-Cost of the electoral district of Ferfax in 53 votes after the vote.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the procedure of the vote accounting on elections for the process.
Tony's daughters Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Is it necessary to make a decision on these elections within two months after we vote?
"We must have a more complex system," he said.
Why should we not have such a system so that we can come, enter our data into the computer, speak and get the result at 18:30 at the same night?
Mr. Palmer also undermined the criticism of the use of carandas in bulletins.
That's because they can lose the result if he doesn't like anyone?
Use the karandas in our time is strange.
The Electoral Commission is conducting a study for electronic vote and has recently repeated a joint discussion document with New Z.
Mr. Palmer, a 59-year-old, said that his programme includes the airport for Sanshain-Costas and he will be "very serious" to his new life.
The State office provides the service of the society.
"We do not gain any reward except the thanks to the history because we can serve this area at a critical moment," he said.
RBS removes two currency triggers
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily removed the work of two triggers in its monetary operational division, two persons known to this situation, which is another subject to the fact that the global check of the regulators of the monetary market provides an effort to carry out roads.
From the largest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, they have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in research with the largest financial market worldwide, which consists of $5,3 million each day.
These two triggers will be the first RBS which are removed in the course of a disturbing investigation, which is called with a scandal with interbancational LIBOR manipulation.
When the bank refused to comment on the elimination, he confirmed that it had received requests for information from the regulatory bodies in this month.
"Our current investigation of this issue continues, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators," reported the bank two weeks ago.
In the past month, notifieds said that the RBS had transmitted the records of electronic mail and instant communications that had received and sent its former treater to the Governing Board of the United Kingdom to the Office for Financial Action Control (FCA).
This trigger, Richard Asher, went out of the RBS in 2010 and, as appropriate, had been granted to him a vacation at its current position of the Officer of Peace's Monetary Monetary Trade in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the Rohman of Peece's advertising trading in Citi, went away this week, while Me Gardiner, an older monetary treater in Barclays and UBS, was removed from the work by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
No of these triggers was accused of any offences.
The contact group of Mr. Asser's instant communications included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to the notified persons.
The UBS bank reported this week that he adopted measures against some of his own terms after the Swiss regulator Finma said he would investigate the estimated manipulation on the monetary market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six governing bodies worldwide — the Commission, Finma, the Swiss Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Value — consider the fact that bankiers have been engaged in an impact on the monetary market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal checks or received requests to provide information from the regulatory bodies, as told by the situation.
The banks are checking on immediate reports and electronic letters for a few years in search of offences.
The news of checks has been introduced to triggers in the field of activities that I have been held in one of the largest income sources of income of investment banks, which, however, faced difficulties in this year because low volatility decreases the opportunities for retailers.
The bankiers tried to decrease the seriousness of the situation, saying that the broad and high-level monetary markets were almost not manipulating, but the older treaders said that it was not always true.
According to the older treater, despite a huge volume of daily trades on the monetary market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trades and the broader use of banks of its internal forms means that “You can begin to affect the market at a very small price”.
This news came on the same day when the Credit Suisse bank announced that one of his traders was released in London's markets on this week, after he had caused a loss of almost 6 million dollars at the end of the year.
Bank has immediately notified the relevant bodies and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are convinced that the treater had been alone and that the question was able to locate”, said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court supported the Obama ' s Health Protection Act
The United States Supreme Court has stated today that Barak Obama ' s signal law on health protection is the constituent, which is the major victory of Obama ' s administration.
By voting 5 against 4, the judges claimed that from there the provisions of the Patient Protection and Available Health Act, which require the citizens to obtain medical insurance until 2014 or pay a lot, I have been constitutional in the powers of the Government for taxation.
The chairman of the Supreme Court John Roberts joined four more liberal members of the court while judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also left the rest of the sections of this 2700-page law and higher claimed that the requirement of the Health Protection Act to increase the requirements of Medicaid, otherwise they will lose all the Federal Medicaid programme, is not unconstitutedly obliged.
The locking of the legislative project has introduced 26 states and the National Federation of independent business.
In contrast with the law, each of the main candidates in the presidents was determined during the 2012 primary election season, including the proposed candidate Mi · Romani.
Football is a reason different?
Policies and experts in the "Open Court" were discussed in Gosdam about how to maintain the national world in Russia.
Among the proposals, it was likely to prohibit football in North Caucas, because this game is one scandal and dish.
Spiker Sergei Nariskin on the recent events in Birulew and said that policy and MMI should be correct in statements to reduce the "great of pressure in society".
He's probably meaning a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinski, who in one of the television translators threatened to surround Kawkaz's wheel, if they don't want to be born...
All the speakers also discussed the measures to regulate migration from the SNR countries and the harmonisation measures between the peoples in Russia, which added to the debate of shame.
The most Gregorieve said that the events in Biruleva were "model conflict that could be pronounced," but "We have too many people and institutions" and seven children have no eyeless child.
The concept of multiculturalism, which long-term migrants had fallen, as the public believed, and must be searched for its way.
History of Yuri Peter made great hopes for a new one of historical teachers.
"We need to create further a support for the history of the culture of the people of the country, so that schoolers in Tatarstan know that people will be in Dagestan, and in contrast," he reported.
Gennadi Zuganov proposed to introduce a voting responsibility for "the calls for Russia's discharge": "If the United States say by the radio that it should be given to the Russian Alaska, you will be arrested and given 20 years of age!"
Vladimir Girinovski was very trying to "not burn".
As usually, he accused journalists who faced the issues of a public debate: "What is the matter in the field?"
The Leader of the Fraction " Only Russia" Vladimir Va's advised the journalists to conclude the " paper" and to agree with the news on this subject accurately, and then the same commitments can be taken on themselves and on politics.
We have adopted approximately 30 laws governing the migration and the general settlement, Mr. Va's stated.
As an example, he introduced a law which imposes the responsibility of the international peace in their territory to the region and the municipality.
But Ludmila Andricanco did not divide the attention of this law: it has no clear ideas about the adjustment of migrants, its mechanisms and parts.
So the subjects will treat a different amount of these powers.
Furthermore, the Municipal municians have no frames that have to resolve such complex issues, no means, and the methodological recommendations that they could use are not provided by the center...
The Chapter of the Nationality Committee proposed that Gajimet Safaralies establish a special knowledge called " National Security Ministry " which would be involved in national policy issues.
But Valerius Tischkov, who was in the 90s, has expressed the similar knowledge that was then exercised, contrary.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, " Minister without a portfolio", to which it could be addressed if something.
"We are on the other hand, the squares run near, very important to the representatives of different ethnics and religions to speak against provocations together, and this work must be worth-in-the-supported," said the representative of the CAP on relations with the Universal Chaplin.
No state's neutrality towards dangerous ideologies, including religious, should be, in its opinion,.
Here Oleg Nilov brought a discussion in an unexpected rush: "There are more talentable people than in Czech or Dagestan, they are still needed, but they are not on the way, not on the way," he said.
"Not that way" is the development of the football: "The footballist kills the whole crowd, then the flags burn, so the companions of the stones...
Maybe we don't need that football?
There's another kind of--Regby is called...
"They will not be in the world in this way!" said the rawross warmly.
There's no one to play in the rebby on Kawkaz!
You're still giving them a carrying!
We need to know the national characteristics, it's just like to offer the "Zoomer" burden...
In Jaroslavla, the vile behaviour of the tribes was dismissed by the representatives of the Moscow Club during the game with the club.
Football must be prohibited throughout the country...
The Chief of the Control-disciplinary Committee of the RFS Arthur Grigorianz reported that Cuban was transferred to 500 thousand rubles, transmitting from the Football House the Corespondent of the Philipp PAPENCOV.
Such sanctions for the Rednodar Club are applied to Dagestan's flags on the court during the 14th tour against Angie.
At the meeting, there were representatives of both clubs, people from the RFPL.
We are investigating all materials.
For the irregular behaviour of the "Kuban" lookers, it is 500 thousand rubles.
Google Company, Samsung, Huawei searches for Nortel Patents
Thursday, the group who had thousands of Patents Nortel had granted a whole series of patents against mobile phone producers, including the Google company whose price it had overtaken on the Nortel bankroad.
Consorcium Rockstar buying $4.5 billion of Nortel patents has provided requests for a violation of patent rights in the United States Court of Assembly in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is in the common property of Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.

These patents cover technology that helps compare the key words of search on the Internet with their respective advertising, states that it is the basis for Google search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not give comments.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones working on the Google Android operational system, which is hardly competiting with Apple and Microsoft products.
In 2011, the Google company proposed a initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased the price several times, finally offering $4.4 billion.
By losing the case of Nortel Consorcio Rockstar patents, Google received Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, and in this deal was partly a Motorola patent library.
"Although a failure to get the auktion patents, I seek the subject, Google has violated and continued to disturb them," says the court.
Rockstar requires a higher remuneration from Google, as he acknowledges that the violation of patent rights by Google is a mental, economic requirement.
In Egypt, the first freely chosen president is committed
Muhammed Mursy is a swearing, but the day of his complaint is to be the end of the political fight in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mushammed Mursi promised the "new Egypt" when he swore, became the first president of the country freely chosen by changing Hosney Mubarak, who was a companion 16 months ago.
On its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court of Justice, Morsi also was the first islamist president of the Arab peace and the fifth Chapter of the State in Egypt after approximately 60 years ago.
He adopted an oath before 18 judges in black manthoods in the court of Nile, built in the style of the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We strive to the best future, the new Egypt and the second reply”, said Murcy during the stakeholder's ceremonie shown directly on public television.
“This is the foundation of the new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability, ” said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer with American education from the “Brother-musulman”, a fundamentalist group, who was most of the 84 years of its existence a prohibited organization, which served as a mistake for cruel change.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers were protected when Mursi arrived with a small courtship after 11 in the morning.
Only a few hundred parties were gathered in the opinion of the court to welcome the new president, and, despite the president's time of Mubarak, the movement was stopped for a short time to lose his car column on the usually survived road of the city's center of southern villages.
Although Mussi had laughed as a neharis as the “reserve” road of the brothers, his personal prejudice was quickly increased since his victory and Friday statement, in which he tried to make himself as a candidate not only for islamists, but also for those who wanted to end up to the 2011 resurrection against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“This Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern State”, said Mursi, clothed in blue business costume with red glass, judges in the general wooden panels of the hall, where he had taken the oath.
Morsi later went to the Cairo University, where he had to say his inauguration thing.
He was given an official receipt with an army orchestra that was executed by the State wheel, while he stood on the stage “smiled”.
There was a military agent of Feldmarshal Husein Tantavi.
His arrival was meet by the “Army and the People One Hand” lounge, which is assembled in the main University Lection Room.
Based on the World Education Plant in 1908 , the Cairo University of the 1970s of the Islamist Student Groups .
Mursy adopted a symbolic swear on Friday on the Tachir area, where the resurrect was born, the end of the authoritary government of Mubarak last year, and promised to return the powers of the president whose office had been excluded by the military Council who had taken the cases from the leader.
However, agreeing to adopt an official swearing before the court, not before the parliament, as adopted, he performs the will of the military, and it is a sign that the fight against authority will continue.
Morsey's word on the Tachir area was filled with theatreous popular gestures.
The special rate of the Tumanian Machine Association was based on the Jalutar Auto Car.
A new line on the production of electrical tubes from stain has been presented in the framework of the business.
According to the commercial director of Denise Grybanov, in 2011, a market investigation on the market in Germany was conducted by the new owner.
It was found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tonnes of electrical tubes per month.
Thereafter, it was decided to change the profile of the cargo and install the equipment on it for their production.
More than 7000 tonnes of production produced in this year have been decreased in this year.
Investment in the carrier was more than 120 million rub-lee, says Dennis Grybanov.
In October, a new term is launched, which allows an increased absorption.
A small profile of the tube that is used for heavy personality, small forms of building and mobile industry, as well as large, for building growth.
We are planning to reach 50,000 tons of production per year, which consists of about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumenian area.
Despite the movement to another type of activities, the number of enterprises has not been decreased - it now consists of 157 people, in the plans for purchasing a new equipment - the increase of the staff to more than 50 staff.
Undertakings and restructuring of frames and professionals are already elected by name.
The future year is planned to introduce a new long-term aggregate to the length of up to five millimeters, allowing the self-production and another, with the speed of the tube to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the enterprises will be able to obtain the output of the tubes used in the residence-community.
The undertaking has the task to close up to 70 per cent of the German needs in this product.
The director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Ostroum, referring to the manufacturers, recommended to give more attention to the modernization of machinery undertakings.
This is also the form of public support for industry, which includes the refund of credit rates for the purchase of a new equipment and the expenditure for its licensement.
These objectives are expected to be assigned to 150 million rubles in the current year, two thirds of this amount have already been treated.
After the Commission, which will consider subsidiarity agreements, adopts documents from undertakings until 15 November.
Furthermore, the budget will pay costs for the participation of producers in jars.
For the future budget year, the amount of 150 million rubles can be used for the compensation of license and credits to obtain a new equipment.
5 million will be involved in the jailmarks, 3 million in the energy programme.
It is reduced to 72 million resources for the remuneration of the prohibited and paid equipment produced in the south of the Germany for the oil complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, this support will be interrupted, since the motive for its introduction was the compensation for the acquisition of oil-coated companies, which were paid in the area budget.
They are currently not doing this and subsidies become the expenses of the region.
In view of this, the Government considers the direct support of industrial enterprises and not the use of oil growth through them.
Budget assistance will be with investment projects that will be able to be produced.
Many ru firms expressed anxiety about the complicated situation in oil.
The contribution to their purchased equipment is a competitive advantage of the southern German industry, and it will be difficult to deal with the price of the average Russian tribe, where the work force is more deep.
Furthermore, an unexpected question of the prejudice to the new owner of the TNC-WR is the Rosneft company, which has not yet placed its orders on prison businesses.
The Agreement on the Implementation of the Uvat Project is expired in 2013, and its applications have not been made.
Currently, the Southern area undertakings specialised for the oil sector can not form a portfolio of orders for the future year.
The question remains open to whether taxes from the oil obtained in the Uvat region will be made to the budget of the region or will be paid on the registration of the new owner of the locations.

"The Court of Justice examined this case in order and recognized the man of a guilty in compliance with the above-mentioned crime with a penalty for 240 hours of commitments," said the Agency's conviction.
She added that the man had completely recognized his fault.
Asarov promised the Ukrainians to cover the prices of the goods after signing the association with the Russian Union
Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov is assured that prices in the country will be significantly reduced after signing an Association Agreement with the Union.
This is what he stated in communicating with his readers at Facebook.
I can certainly say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including payments.
So, after signing the agreement and entry into force of the position on the Free Trade Zone, the level of imports from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that will mean that the prices should be decreased.
"This is the case of goods that progress from the EU countries," Azarov wrote.
What other goods are deferred, the impact of the price agreement will not be so crucial, it will be concentrated.

After the accusation of the foolishness of the V
The Va'veva's person, to whom nearly a year has been given an accurate attention to MMI, has not yet been commented on a number of presses in the Mino Defence and on an ex-minister of the Defence of Anatolia, its poessy and the adversity to valuable things.
However, on 1 November, the "Defenseservice" case deteriorated silence.
In the Life News Va's interview, "It was clearly one: to draw out any negative information about the former Minister of Defence."
There was a chance for me to testify, elsewhere I'm going to be seated in the woods.
Today, these threats have been stopped.
We're going to the court, we'll prove our innocentity.
We're sure that we're winning 100 percent.
In this way, the interview can conclude that, more than a widespread statement of the fact that it is not important to be cute.
The statement of the Official Representative of the CC RF Vladimir Markin is probably that in the collection of the images that the " Defenseervis ' s figure " were found, the subsections were found.
Among the arrested property, there are a number of pictures that the master, assured of his deep knowledge of the world's lifework, has obtained as leaders.
However, the experimental expertise appointed by investigators after arresting these images established that they had no artificial value and that I simply was being involved in the depths," Markin said at the beginning of October.
Some pictures stolen by the Defence Minister...
Then they recognized that they were not stolen from the Minor Defence, and they said I had a bad thing to do.
Who has the right to discuss my cousin, discuss some kind of moments?
I think it's just an uncle," says Va'veva.
In this matter, if she recognises her guilt in one of the 12 criminal events she had committed, Va'eva said, "No, no.
Recognizing nothing.
Furthermore, there is no damage to the Russian Federation.
They're just putting people into error, that's all.
Furthermore, in response to today's statement of the CC RF that Va ́eva was dismissed from the study of the voting case materials, the figure claimed that he and his client had "requests" not allowed him to know the materials of the case."
What was the cause of revelation under the home arrest of Va’a, which has not been associated with the press?
Maybe how did a woman not get to answer the accusation in a bad bathroom?
Or is it the right journalist "Comsomolka", who said a couple of days ago that she "founded into a more large cross under the home arrest" because of the reconciliation of Anatolia Serdukov with her wife and his return to the family's hall?
A known military overview of the "KP" Victor Baranak in its article "Serdukov returned to the wife?" wrote, "The followers do not exclude that after that, she could become more spectacular at the question."
Earlier, the B.A.A. took some accusations for the illegal sale of the Mino defence property.
Precimal guys.

Dmitriy Medvedev: The growth of GDP RF is not sufficient for the development of the State
The Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev considers that it is not sufficient for RF to increase its GDP and that the situation can be improved by facilitating the conditions of business credit and changing the Russian economy's structure by orienting the innovation.
We have planned this year to grow in the area of 3%, perhaps even a little more.
It will actually be less than 2%.
At the background of the recession throughout a number of countries it would not be very bad, but it is little for us because the economic base is not as powerful as in the whole of several countries, and it must be higher to develop.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian business, receive standards of credit at normal price, are the first things to be done," stressed the Government chapter.

Railway for free medical assistance to the rivers, rivers and jungles
Dr. George Bwell provides free medical assistance in rural areas in Cameroon
Bwell and his team are almost every output, taking hundreds of patients
In this Western African country, docs are not so much - only one for 5000 people
Proclaim here or through your device
Dr. George Bwell is one of the 10 main heroes CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 main heroes to be the Hero of CNN.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his work.
During the 21th year, George Belle saw his father returning to life and again falling into an unconscious with the hospitals that were not equipped properly to help him.
Jamef Bwell got a trauma in the car disaster in 1981 near June, Cameroon capital.
He had only a broken hand, but the emergency infection was spread to the brain and called to a chemat that reminded himself of himself until the end of life.
"The Cameroon had no neurochirurgs," George Bwell said.
If we had money, we would have brought him out of Camerun.
Instead, Belle was conducted by his father for years in overflow clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
"It's not easy," said Bwell.
- You can get out of the house at 5 tomorrow, come to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
A lot of patients.
They may die because they have to wait.
The situation was not very changed by the end of Belle's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor for 5000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the relationship in the United States is one of 413 people.
And even if the camioners could turn to the doctor, many of them would not have been in the harmony.
Two of the five in this country will be a poverty, and almost three quarters of health costs are private.
"Their only problem is poverty," said Bwell.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives."
By seeing the suffering of his father and many of his partners, Belle had made a decision to do something with that.
Last year Dr. George Bwell and his volunteers team conducted 700 free operations.
He himself is a doctor and works as a sadist chirurg in the Centre of Young Hospital.
He also founded a non-commercial body of ASCOVIME, which organized forests in agricultural capacity for free medical assistance.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, up to 30 people are bought in carriers, are linked to medical stakeholders and go to the cross-section to visit the needed people in the village.
They are not always lucky.
Sometimes they had to carry the cars through rivers and rivers.
But when they come, their meetings are like real heroes: this is a feast with songs and dances and the best places that can only be offered by people.
Free medical service in these villages is actually a conduct for the festival, and Belle with his wide smile and unlimited energy is more than happy to join pleasure.
On the next morning, the brigade starts to take hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people in each ship," he said.
They come throughout the street in a radio of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come by the foot.
Each of these clinics on the day of exit provides different medical services.
Many people receive therapy from maâmia, tuberculosis, insufficientness, diabetes, parasites and diseases, transmitted by sex.
Others can get the bones, on the points of beauty or the free birth testimony — documents for schools that many poor families can simply not allow themselves.
The brigade is conducting simple operations under anestesia during the night.
Operations are usually conducted in school, municipality, or home; after the procedures patients arise and go to the post-operation area to free a place for a person.
The island generator for the operational and sanitary equipment, Bwell and its volunteers work until the morning.
This is not a temperature, but the full-depreciation of the brigadium is usually helped to support the housing farmers.
"They strike the whole night in the barbans, so that we can keep on working and keep working," he said.
On Sunday, the members of the brigade are returned to the city, standing, but fierce.
This group, consisting of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students, has conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance may be a great importance for those who have helped.
One person explained that the free treatment of the grass would allow him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical receipts, Bwell’s chirurgic hospital works also nights in private medical clinics around Juneda.
It is exactly that this second work, according to it, guarantees 60 per cent of its non-commercial organization; the rest of the funds are covered by privacy.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Cathy O'Melley, a doctor of the second course of the Dressel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwell Group.
He is always in the hospital or is trying to acquire money for the organization so that these campaigns can be continued.
For future doctors and sisters, such as O'Melley, who are coming from the United States and are to join Belle in carrying out his tasks, it is the opportunity for them to never get home.
"We have received the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped to remove five blood or to keep tools for Dr. Belle," O'Melley said.
As a secondary student, you would never have received such opportunities in America.
Voluntary Students usually pay their journey to Cameron, often coming with medical medicinal products.
But after they arrived in Juneda, their food, transport and training pays Belle.
"He's a hero, without doubt," O'Mally said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help people of Cameroon is infinite.
For Belle, the continuous threat is not a severe trial.
To help others to live happy, to fulfill the promise to their father is a great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this," said Belle.
- And I think of my dad.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to let people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME site and see what you can help.

Both refuses its words on health protection
Among the storm of the criticism, President Obama went to his frequently repeated, unique promise that "if you like your medical insurance plan, you can keep it."
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people have been informed about the stop of service from their passengers, the replies have recently criticized the president because it is a misleading American society.
Wednesday, Obama made a few of his original public promises.
"The majority of people who have a medical insurance that works can keep it," he said in his statement in Boston.
Since he called “life in news” because of the breakdown of service, Obama invited those receiving these notices to the Americans to seek other market options.
Most people will have the opportunity to obtain better, complex medical insurance plans at the same price or even the advantage of the predictment.
He said, "You will receive more good conditions."
The Administration claimed that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the population who purchases insurance may be required to change plans because their covering does not comply with the new standards set out in the Medical Assistance Act.
"Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve best," Sibelius said in a statement before the Energy Committee and the trade of the representatives' palaces in Washington.
Sibelius, who purchases the accessible medical assistance law, said that the use of the Internet sales and “what is terriblely bad” from October.
"I'm disappointed and disappointed as well as everything," she said.
- I really want to return your confidence."
The distressed Sibelius defended this phrase, captured by the involved microphone, sitting behind her assistant at the yesterday hearings in the hall after heavy debates with a member of the hall of the representatives of Billy Long, a repliant from Missouri State, about whether she was committed to the health programme of Obama.
After more than three hours of Long ' s hearing, Sibelius urged again to say why the "Identator" of the Available Medical Assistance Act was not voluntarily from the sponsored insurance government to get a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now calls for millions of Americans.
The "Rosbalt" agency left the MMI status for non-country weapons
On 31 October, Mosgarwood called to recognize an ineffective licence on the registration of the Agency Rosbalt, " says Lenta.
In the disfellowship of the MMI status agency, the Roscomman Surveillance for systematic and cruel infringements of MVU law.
In the course of the process, an inappropriate president was created: the court considered to close MMI, actually refused the issue in the right to deal with conflicts.
What's "Rosbalt"?
The Rosbalt In-Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the Agency opened the second Office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
The Agency also works as representatives in the countries of the former SSR.
Since 2001, the Rosbalt has developed a function as a federal in­ternal analysis of the Agency.
In the middle of the 2000s, the Agency included the list of most recognised private Internet SMEs in Russia.
In this context, the Rosbalt always was a sufficient specific noise: the nuclear of the Agency ' s exclusive agencies (and to this point) made notes with resources in the right-keeping authorities.
The discussions on the nearby issue to power structures continued during all the time of the Agency.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had a broad source base in various scientists, such suggestions were also spoken of Natalia Chaplina, Victor Churques' wife in the project.
The role of Chaplina in the "Rosbalt" leader is not clear to the end: most often it is called "Ru" project.
The Director-General of the Agency is Laris Afonin, the main editor of Nikolai Uljana.
Recently, the Rosbalt is not a figure in the Federal SME ratings - not a quota or a audience.
In October, the Agency took the 25th place in the review of the visitability of Russian SME sites on Live Internett.
The liveInternet states that the average audience of the rosbalt.ru site consists of approximately 150,000 individual visitors (and up to 500,000 reviews) in the month is about three million unique visitors.
Including the most popular materials in the past five months, the notes of the inevitability of Cremela in Ukraine, the death of the solitaire group " King and Shut" in the Stone of Birule.
The Russian conflict with the Russian Surveillance began in July 2013 when the amendment to the MMI law was entrusted with the journalists who had prohibited non-country weapons.
The science has found a prohibited lessons in two ops on the site of the video rolls ("Jigith from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot has contaminated oil heights").
The following parties are described differently.
The supervisory overseer of discovered video materials has accused the Rosbalt in the neck and systems the violation of the MMI law and has requested the court to take the licence to the Agency.
In the Russian statement that the accusations of science are unfair: first, I did not have the roles of the editorial materials, secondly the mother's words were masked, and, thirdly, after the warning of the role, they were removed from the site.
The representatives of the Agency complained with the statement of the Court of Justice in the world - and when Mosgarsod was adopted on 22 October 2013, the review of these complaints continued.
However, 25 numbers of world judges have taken a decision not in favour of the " Rosbalt ": the main editor of Nikolay Ulianov has recognised a guilty in the violation of the Code of Administrative Prosecutions and .trafs for 20,000 rubles for each role.
This, obviously, prevented the outcome of the hearing in Moshordès - if it was refused to think that the result could be provided before.
On 31 October, the Court decided to recognize an ineffective evidence of the Registration of Russbalt, actually lost the MMI status agency.
Without saying that Rosbalt remained alone in the course of this opposite.
The Agency was supported by the deputats of the Hosdoma (Agency signed 26 deputats on 10 October; document itself was given at the initiative of the CCPF).
The Chapter of the Russian Journalists of the University of Goddanov, the president of the Moscow Union journalists Paul Gusev and the Chapter of the President of the Human Rights Council of Michael Fedots.
Moreover, Goddan's statement, the Roscom Surveillance Guide even before him has guaranteed that the matter would not come before the licence is revoked.
The Court of Justice stated that the media in Russia today is a major issue under which it is more safer to be found in Russia.
Syria has an engineering equipment
Syria has recognized all the powers declared for the production of aircraft, and the Organization for the prohibition of aircraft.
This first phase of discharge of Damascus ended the day before the time set.
By 1 November, Syria had to provide productive and other income objects intended for the preparation of fighting instruments to apply, translates the Bi-by-si.
The destruction of the self-reserves of refrigerators or their chemical components should be completed at the middle of 2014.
According to the representative of the OSHO, currently the removing arts are located in printed stocks.
The international inhabitants moved to Syria after the 21 August of Damascus in the coming of the attack, more than 1400 people were killed in the United States.
The main task of the inhabitants was not to lose time - not to allow Syrian authorities to produce more chemicals - and to enable the infrastructure to mix chemicals and the discharge of fighting.
These productive powers will now be carefully observed so that they will not allow their rest.
The next week is the middle of November: To this time, the OSHO and the Syrians should have a name of the resources for the relief.
A lot of questions here.
Where will they go?
Who will provide this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be fully checked by western interviews.
They will be willing to advise the in-workers new objects to verify if they are suspicious that Damascus is not open until the end.
The United States believes that this shot was carried out by the rule of military armies.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the case of Syrian rebels.
The world community needed the Syrian leadership - in terms of the agreement made by Russia - to make or bring all the powers to the production of plants, gases and liquids and to fill the arrangements with these things.
Now, when this stage has passed, it must be a step in the Syrian Army.
It is supposed that there may be more than 1000 tons of nervous-paralytic recycling arts, every-inflammable gas and other prohibited chemical arts in several decades of different species.
It needs the OSHO and the Syrian authorities to begin with two weeks.
The OSHO OZHO Jerry Smith said Bi-by-si that his in-shore were "personally observed by the equipment".
"They do not now have the opportunity to carry out further production or mixture of the weapons," he said.
The OSHO statement states that 21 of the 23 objects in Syria had been visited and were assured that the ships for the production of ships and rubbers were disrupted or led into an injury.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out the inspection, stated in the document, but the equipment was transferred and verified by OECD specialists.
According to Smith, the process of the infrastructure on the production of hydrocarbons was " increasingly simple", since work was required under continuing conflict.
At the beginning of October, the OSHO received the Nobel world premium, but, according to Smith, it was time to release it to the inhours until it was found, they were too busy.
John Carry says in his unpresidently recognizing that the American spieon was "coming in a distant way"
John Carry Promotor of the United States Following Programmes Tactic Reconciliation made an unprecedented acknowledgement that in some cases, the United States spying has “come unlikely far away”.
The Secretary also recognized that he was guilty of Barak Obama, as well as that he was " on the car pilot" during the emergency of Edward Snowden's sound disappointment for the NBS spying.
The United States Government has placed this information in the centre of the diplomatic with their associates.
With video connections at the open Governing Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "No doubt the President and other Government members have actually accepted some of the events that occurred on the carrier because this opportunity had already been, and during the Second World War, and in very difficult years of cold war, and, of course, on 11 September."
Then he was the first highly established member of the United States Government, recognized that the spionship had gone too far, but stressed that no rights were violated.
He said, "In some cases, this has been unlikely far away.
And the president fully decided to shine the light on this issue and to explain to the people, and now it is a close analysis that does not have any sense of misuse.
I assure you that there is no misuse for innocent people in this process."
Mr. Carrie claimed, however, that the UNHCR was from good incentives and that its follow-up operations saved many lives.
He added: “We work in a new world where people are ready to explode.
There is a radical extremism in the world, an unwise and full determination to kill people, to explode people and to attack governments.
And if you were able to catch it, would you stop it before it happens?
In fact, we prevented the violation of aircrafts, the explosions of humans and the killing, because we could learn about these plans before."
Among them, the American legislators will be entrusted in order to help resolve issues with the expected American spionship and to convince the need to continue joint anti-terrorist activities from the United States, said the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Peeking on Thursday.
The Senator of the State of Connea, Chris Merphy, said that he had discussed members of the Parliament and others on this week and was concerned with threats to stop participating in anti-terrorists because of disappointment of the follow-up carried out by the National Security Agency.
"For the interests of the United States' national security, it is really important that the peers remain our parties in relation to our common anti-terrorist efforts," said the Democrate Merphy, who works at the first time and I am the Chairman of the Undercommittee of the Senate on Peace Affairs, in the interview of Washington.
“And I am going to give them understanding that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger in the conduct of these NBS programmes.”
The news that the UNB collected millions of phone records in the face of the United States have been deteriorated by some associates, although the head of the Agency stated that they were unfair and reflected the disapproval of the metadata collected by the NATO associates and whom they shared with the United States.
Other clouds included Snowden's documents that testify that UNB monitored the phone officer of Germany’s Angel Mercel and some 34 other world leaders' phones.
The Director of the National Intelligence of James Clapper protected the spy activity of the unions as a person and said that it was a common case from both sides.
At the background of this noise, Merphy said that his office was organizing the easier members of the Congress, which, as expected, would be held in this year, and that he hoped that the members of both parties and the two palats would be involved in the establishment of the delegation.
The names of other participating legislators should be studied in the next days.
According to his statement, the easier programme is still once.
Although Merphy stated that the easier purpose was to improve, he said that a certain degree of “greatness from the best incentives” would also be shown.
He said that the leaders of Pepee should be honest with their people in what spy programs they themselves have spent for many years.
"When we can modify our follow-up programmes to protect the rights of the songs, they should also agree that we are not the only ones who are working in a discernment activity," said Merphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry should go to these outcomes to the Middle East and Poland to solve the issues of enemyability against the United States in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States Research.

In order to control the UNHCR and combat the right-defence and the lobbyists.
At the meeting of the ONG slaves group, I have made a criteria for the selection of legal activities.
"It wasn't accepted, and the forms of the spice, and you did not set the criteria," says Valerius Borschov.
The current president of the Moscow Supervision of the Commission and the Association of independent observers, the universal structure of the rightsguardians, faced with problems.
As the Deputy of Gosdam from " Jablok " he had a law governing UNHCR activity.
The OP Council should vote for UNC in 43 countries.
In 1800 vakantists, less than thousands of volunteers claim, but in Inghussia and Cabardino-Balcarian competitions have not been able to organize competitions because of the absence of candidates.
The OP promises to organize a donation to vacant places.
Moscow ONC is one of the few committees with competition, despite that there will be 40 participants in the new construction.
According to Bouršov, the current establishment of the Staff Commission of 11 rights-defence and 9 forces, and in the OP voting option, the relationship is changed to 17 to 23.
Thus, 30 rightsguardians wanted to enter into the Staff Commission.
Therefore, the Representative of the "Bood Brothership" of Veczeslav Kalinin may be re-introduction.
He was a member of the UNHCR three years, but he never visited the prisoners.
The fighter believes that the forces, appointed by their President of the UNHCR, are able to make legal defenses unemployable, and thus the rightguardians do not exclude collective outcome from the Commission.
They believe that the movement of forces coordinates the member of the UN Anton Flowers, named " Russian Officers" - a body which is deploying the interests of forces.
"I don't eat a kid on the board," said RBK daily Anton Flowers.
He refuses to lobby the movement of any lists and says that it is not going to prevent the rightguardians to visit arrested oppositioners.
According to Florkov, he was not even interested in what list they now vote in the OP.
The discovery of Borsch information is the form of pressure.
The potential success of the right-defensors is a planning change in the leading of the Cherubinian UNHCR.
It would have been removed by the ru of those who have been born because of the previous year's Kopi's distress.
The Common Chamber concluded that the leadership of the Commission was the ignorant of the problems of prisoners.
And this is the ONC Rost-To-Done can go from the right-protectors to the forces.
From the new ' missing ' lists, the President of the Commission, one of its opposers, despite that in May 2013 the Federal Court excluded it for a non-ethical behaviour.
The lists of the Moscow and Growth Committees Boršov are "copeysk place".
The Altoconic hopes have not affected the CNS of Mordovia, which they consider "force": it wanted only one legal defendant to fall in the new composition, and it had not even adopted competition documents.
The member of the OP Nikolai Swanede's Council told the RBK daly that he voted against the proposed puzzle because he was forced by the situation in Moscow and Rostove-na-Dona.
He sent his position to other members of the Council.
His colleague of OPA Paul Guseb says he voted for, since he likes the Moscow list proposed.
The coordinate of the establishment of UN Secretary-secretary of OPA Vladislav Grib, I also am the Scientific Research Institute of the FSIN.
The Gryb told the CRK daly that it does not consider the right to share the candidates in the rights of the defendants and the forces and that the chairmans of the Commission are sufficient powers to prevent its members.
The Grib is not to predict the outcome of the vote of the OP Council.
If the proposed list is opened today, the amendment will be issued in the next days.
The Australian woman calls against a time-life in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sidney, who was sentenced to 15 summers on the Phoeket Island for the false fact that she had been attacked by a taxist, made an appellation to the sentence and was released under charge.
Steve Roshel B'Ford was initially recognised by the Court of Justice of Phoechetic Province on 15 June in the submission of a false request after the Tayland police report that the taxist had been attacked on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men held it.
However, the video surveillance cameras later discovered that she was well - returned to her hotel after its Australian battlefriend.
The puke police asked B'Ford for two days before it recognized the fact that she had made this story.
Before the court, it was held in the police rooms.
B’Ford was convicted to the 15-fourth term in the centre of the general regime of prisoners in the Phucket region, not in the female for adults.
It is the daughter of the former player of the Australian Ligue Peter Tanks, who was invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for aid for her daughter.
Tanx said the Sunday Telegraph of Sydney that the whole family was "infinely calm" to his daughter's welfare and waited for her return to Australia.
"Obviously it was an anxiety time, but we hope that it will be home as well as possible," Tanx said.
B'Ford was charged with a charge of 50,000 baths.
According to reports in Australia, it currently takes its release in the corner area of Kraby in South Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that B'Ford presently represents a Phucket, but it was warned that the complaint could lead to an increase in its sentence for a period of two years and would cause it to take a period of time for adults.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian tourist Michel Smith in Phuquet Thailand, he may also strive to restore his broken imidga tourist, which will bring a justificative sentence.

Roman Sencin is an uncertain leader of the current 30-year-old and 40-year-old prosecutor.
Absolutely every spectacle of its heavy materials built on modern life stories and stories causes warm disputes among the critics of the most different directions.
It may be acknowledged that the collected articles on the Prose and Publicity of Sinchina, the reviews on its books and journalizations create an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the end of the 1990s to the beginning of 2010.
In discussions on the productions of " one of the most modern writers", according to Sergei Chuprini's criticism, it is most important to say that its participants understand under the term " literature", which the present and future see not only our speech but also our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book was not allowed to include most articles and reviews from regional MME and blogosphere.
Analysis and review articles are generally reported in the sections "Applications..."
