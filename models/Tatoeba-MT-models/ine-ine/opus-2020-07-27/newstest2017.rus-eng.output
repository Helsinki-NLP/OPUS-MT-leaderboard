Does it need to go to the sanator if there is no health problems?
Our expert is the main sanator doctor of Olga Bouch.
And if a man's healthy, he's just quiet from work, should he go to the sanator?
We have not only a sanitary and corroborate relaxation for treatment but also a profile of diseases.
Under the conditions of sanitary, a person can check his body and receive a doctor's recommendation to live in order to avoid disrupting its health.
Such recommendations will not be limited to anyone.
"Only awakened from work" is a significant signal of the body, which should not be dismissed.
Permanent stress, mental and physical rehabilitation may lead to depressions and a syndrome crown of depression.
And the stress is 90% of the coming people.
He's most supported by people from large cities from 45 to 55 years of age.
So it's better not to complicate the situation and give it time to relax.
Researchs have shown that 98 per cent of people are decreasing their biological age during the residence in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatories have comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to take off your children, you will not have to leave them.
Children, even smallest, have been predicted by the diagnostic services, the advice of the child, the analysis and the treatment.
For example, floating (in many sanators there are bases), ingalation, food regime, massage, oxygen cocktails, treatment physician.
The course of procedures determines the doctor, taking into account individual evidence and characteristics of the current body.
Furthermore, in sanatories, a Club with Animators works usually where children can visit game jobs, different class-masters.
The sanators open their doors even for guests with children, ensure the conditions for the kidneys and provide services for experienced nurse.
The mild winter, a long summer, the rest of sundays in the year (over 300) creates good conditions for the round-year rest on the Caucas Mineral Waters Courses.
And then the body needs relaxation not only for summer.
So we should not be afraid of the weather outside the window, as far as most of the procedures are carried out in the room and are not dependent on the season.
In general, sanitary and core treatment is desired to carry out 2 times per year, especially adults.
Main Fiscal of the Caucasian Mineral Water Region, of course, the medical mineral sources: Slovenian, Smirnski, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters are unique and affect the various systems of the body.
The water is different from the temperature, the number of salts, the general mineralization, the chemical and gas composition.
The doctor chooses water depending on the self-sensitivity of the patient.
So, "Narzan" is opposed to the immunomodulating, repairing the functions of the iron-bottle tract and the exchange of arts.
"Essentuki-4" affects the iron-shake treaty, decreases the level of sugar.
The "new census" is an anti-real, iron and mosque.
The same effects have also the "Slavyanski" water.
When the water is appointed, the doctor is obliged to take into account the heart-conscious system.
If there are signs of hypertension, he chooses less salt water because the salts hold the weight that leads to increased pressure.
The adoption of mineral water requires the monitoring of the system: water should be drinked at a certain time, at the appropriate amount and the specific temperature.
There are also various cosmetological procedures available in the sanators for the body and the body.
What kinds of health on the natural characteristics of North Kawka can be obtained in the courses of this region?
Near Fivegarsk, for example, there is a salt lake of Tambucan, a lobster of which is useful for ingredients, clothing, internal organs.
It shows an anticipational, dissatisfiant, immunomodulating.
These are the railways of individually established routes.
They are popular in Kislowodsk, where there is a great Kurt Park (the second in size).
Pope is in Kislowodsk, which is directly near the Mineral Source of Narzan.
There you can also take bathrooms of vine, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil-lactic, depending on what a doctor will appoint you.
Forward the fruitage.
What are you doing to go to the end of the season?
It tells Julia Belopuchov, agron, and damn.
High-ground tomates are able to build a shock: remove new passports, cut the macks, remove all the sheets to the previous floor with fruits and small bonds - they will not be able to see.
All tomates independent of the "constitution", as well as the petroleum and bacteria are feeding with gold-superphosphate exhausts, processed by bio-treated products (Doses - for the increase of nitrogen and fruit growth, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamari, Baktofith - from disease, immunocyt - to increase immunity, Bitobacillin, Lepidocid, Fitoverm, if there are damage).
From chemicals at the end of the summer only should be applied as colloid serum, colloid serum, and green milk.
We're doing the last floor.
The long-term heat bullets are providing from the spider so that the lower, hot part of the steel (25-40 cm) is on the ground, floating with warm water and solvency of Cyrcon, spending the 5-7 cm of the composite.
Prolong the fruitage of the cab is also unfortunate: cut the old sheets, broke the heat of water and the solution of the complex use, swip the fruitful floor under the coast.
In order to protect the colds from night, set the woods with covered material over.
Keep open on the day of the sun and shut down after sunrise.
End marks.
What indicates that Russia is out of the crisis?
Economys have seen the signs of Russia ' s outcome in the last twenty years of recession.
As the Bloomberg Analysis Agency notes, the BDP RF demonstrates the local dynamic - in the second quarter of the BDP was decreased by 0.8 per cent in the annual expression.
This indicator has been minimum since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data, the Russian economy falls in the second quarter to 0.6 per cent.
The Stabilisation of the situation has also been stated recently by the Central Bank and the Minecon-Environment.
Forward is a slow growth.
According to CBI experts, the Russian economy recession remained in the past.
"The Index of the Russian BDP says that the recession remained behind and in front is a slow growth of the economy," says the Russian Bank Bulletin "What the trends are talking about."
The current quarter of the regulator specialists have increased to 0.4 per cent, and the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
As reported by the representative of Minecon-Environment, during the second quarter, the fall of the BDP RF was stopped in the second quarter, consisting of 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, a sezonally cleaned BDP fall from 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, it was stopped: in April, it was 0.2 per cent, and in May and June, the change in GDP was located in sections 0 to 0.15", quoted by the representative of MAR RIA "News".
The delay of the fall of Russian economy during the last five quarters testifies that "the bottom has been passed".
Bloomberg, among other markers indicating the survival of the national economy, calls for the growth of electricity and rail transport, business life.
If the year is high, it is understandable that the dynamic to plus 1% of electricity consumption may be a half of an additional slave day.
We will add to this a lower medium-year temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of carriers, but it is difficult to get exact data, and plus 0.5% of the half-year volume can also be explained by season," explains Kirill Jacobenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more evident signs of the stabilisation of the Russian economy.
For example, the reduction of price pressure.
In July, consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Moreover, in the last two weeks, growst fi has deflated.
Prices in Russia were decreased in the first five years.
When looking at the dynamic of the rate of the rubber, which, although she had shown the rubber at the beginning of the year, has been strengthened by 12 per cent from the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of the restoration to which the indicators from the real economic sector should be taken, " Jacobenko emphasises.
Furthermore, the growth of industrial production has been observed since April in the RF.
In June, the indicator increased by 1.7 per cent.
In January 2016 to -20.7% in May, the outer travel falls are therefore quiet.
The positive dynamic also demonstrates the situation on the labour market, where the level without the labour was decreased to 5.4 per cent.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the good situation on the labour market, the issue of the real income of the population is to leave a better desire.
In the annual expression, the indicator is decreased by 4.8 per cent.
This factor may cause rebuilding the economy, since the costs of households contribute to the GDP.
In the economy structure, their share is normally over 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, as risk factors for economic growth, it can also be called a cruel Russian Bank policy.
The regulator holds the rate of 10.5%, which is not best referring to the real sector.
The negative factor is also an insufficient high level of investment that supports the development of industrial capacity.
However, at the end of the year, it is possible to assume that the RF economy falls down to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015," says the GK Forex Club of Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of sportmen recently launched in the Russian football and enjoyed great winter species in the Olympide in Sochi, until so actively developed in the summer species.
If in the Olympics to Rio for Russia and the expression of former foreigners, most of the cases of the relief and deception of the countries would be the replies of the Council Union.
Thus, in Rio de Janeiro, we can watch the turning process - a lot of Russian expressions under the flags of other States.
In any case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Some parents have not left the choice to another country.
Someone had no competition in the construction of a Russian collection.
Someone believed that the best conditions for development in the territory would be created outside the border.
AIF.ru found at least 16 sportsmen who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In the German passport of 27 years, it is written that it is Lisa Ridge.
But earlier she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
All four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union was devastated, Lisa's parents decided to migrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow her older sister's steps -- to take a easy athletic.
Like the sister, Lisa chose a six-year-old pigs.
She's staying in Russia, so she'd almost be able to "move from the throne" to Elena Isinbae.
Unfortunately, on the Olympyade in Rio Lisa, it will be our only landscape, even the former, in the six-six-shop sector.
Its best achievements in this way are the bridge of the campaign in 2010 and the silver of the continental priority in 2016, which she has won again in the absence of Elena Isinbai.
The 29-year-old Elena Pirožkov was born in Novokuzneke in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandaists of the Gospel direction.
For many reasons of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
Further than Elena, eight children were growing up in the family.
They all lived in a small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena started to be in a fight at school.
In showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado-Springs, where the United States School Center continued to take the lead of another former Russian Vladislav's Prosecutor.
In Olympyade 2012, London Elena lost in her first collection.
So on the world campaigns the same year, the victory.
Before this, she was able to win the money at the world priority of 2010.
Thereafter, the 2013 brown and the 2014 silver.
The 26-year-old Mary was born in Jaroslavle, where she was first familiar with the synchronous plane.
But to say that our trainers were trained in Russia, it would be wrong.
The family decided to emigrate in the United States and to reside in the city of Colorado.
There Mary continued her jobs.
It was already in the United States and had great results in the Panama games.
It is understanding that at a serious international level of Russian synchronists it cannot compose competition, but for America its indicators is a milk.
The new name in Russia that sounds strange, Christina Suldibin was received at 11 years when her parents decided to continue training the girl's artificial gimnasty outside the ocean.
Before this time, the girl had a favorite species of Yaroslaw’s family.
By immigrating to the United States, she quickly entered the youth collection of this country and later entered the main national team.
On the Panama games, 19-year-old Christen won gold and silver.
For the first positions in the world scene, of course, it didn't come to fight, but it organized a real break for the U.S. - she brought a star-road collection at the Olympics games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former "masters" is Jana Beresco-Marggrander, who is speaking for the collection of Germany.
She was born in Tollette.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there was more perpetrators to fall into the national collection.
She already represented her country at the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
There, indeed, she could only take 17 places that are insufficient to enter the finish with personal priority.
So in two years ago, I'm like to win the brown medal of the Olympian Youth Games.
Another gimnasty, only this time, is Irina Sazonova.
If the emigration paths of previous sports may be called standards, Irena's family is very unusual, Iceland.
Ira is a Wolgograd School School School.
Of course, in Iceland, she became a campaign country.
True, Ira's trained in Russia, however, is especially coming to the family so that it does not lose art.
She didn't say to Rio so lucky as she wanted.
The best place is 40 in the personal multi-session.
The information on Marie Hungel's pool in the Russian in-spacing area is very little.
Maria lives and trains in Switzerland for a long time.
However, for a long time, she was under Russian flag, which had a bad result - even the record of the country was 200 meters away from the batterfly.
In 2015, she received the Swiss citizenship and began to speak under the red-white flag.
Its best statement in Rio is 14 places in the complex estafet 4x100.
In order to join the game, the stole started a thick project, which enabled it to collect 6000 franks that allowed her to pay for the preparation for Olimpiade.
The 31-year-old warrior of the free style of Adam Batirove has carried out almost all his career under the Russian flag.
At that time, Hassuurt's birthday was able to become a three-fold campaign campaign, a Russian campaign, a meist of the International Class of Russia.
When he stopped falling into the national collection, it was time to go back to the change of civility.
For a few years, the talented warrior has fallen with a abilities.
The triumphal return was at the Asian campaign in 2016 - Batiros had already represented Bahrain, for which he had won the golden medal and received a road to Olympida to Rio.
Another ex-Russian, Michael Kudinov, is still less than even the Swiss-Switzerland wheelman Maria Ugolkov.
His parents were emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very small.
That's exactly where Michael started to work with a gimnasty.
He did not have great successes at the international level.
The best result in Rio was 40 places in the wallow of paralyzed brushes.
But for New Zealand, even the invasion of Olympian games in the →Himnastic is already a break.
When Nasta, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family was emigrant to Israel.
There the girl continued to work with the synchronic floor, and high results at national level.
In 2014, the campaigns in Berlin took the sixth place in synchronization.
Anastasia took the eighth place in the Duate with the Tetelbaum Guinea.
It was fifth in the salt programme.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Croyter is dealing with the collection of Israel.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate Israel.
In 2009, the 17-year-old Dmitri is a campaign of the country.
That same year, he won in a youth campaign of the world.
A year later, Croyter wins the gold of young Olimpian games in Singapore.
Besides the heights, Dmitrie's carrying out a width and a three-year cup.
The 31-year-old Albert is another Hassuurt-born who has decided to change his citizenship after the statements for Russia.
However, apart from Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which will be represented in Rio.
In Russia, he spoke for the Higher Cross-Yard University School, even being a campaign of the country in 2011.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of a collective SSR player at Jaroslav Antonov's volunteer.
A year before the birth of the son of Jaroslav was recognized by the best volunteer of the planet.
In the meantime, he decided to continue the career in Italy.
The family was there and remained for a permanent residence.
In 2015, the national team was a bronze campaign to be conducted in the territory of his new family.
Hajiev was born in Czech in 1994, and he and his family were in the most devastated war.
Ten years old, parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was unable to get into this northern country - it had to go to France, Nitz.
There Zelimhan continued to teach free fighting.
He wined the world's priority among the Olympics, and later the quality was also to participate in the Olympical Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the fighting tournament.
And again, it's a good fight, and again the former Russian.
This time, you can say about the birth of North Osetia, who is the emigrant in Spain, about Taimurez Freeve.
At the end of December 2012, he was assigned to the Spanish citizenship, and now he is being a collective team of the country.
Before this, the 30-year-old sportsman has been able to note high results in Russia.
He became a bridge of the country's campaigns 2007 and 2008.
The conclusion of the failures to the collection, Timuras decided to change the citizenship.
The last in our list and the Czech boxer born in 1995 at the capital of Dagestan Mahachale, Arthur Biarslav.
When the boy was ten years old, parents brought a family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
Arthur, according to the advice of his older brother, began to work a box.
Since that pool, Arthur became a Canadian campaign three times, and in 2012 it was a world campaign among young people.
In 2015, Biarslavans won the gold of the Panama-American games, the first for his new family since 1975.

Gentlemen, he's got a son.
Why do I talk classs in schools?
According to Governor V. Condraciev, "the claims must be trained not by action and advice, but by systemic."
They must grow and understood at least 7 years of age that they have to be speaking and educational.
But until this work, as I do, is formal and, I suspect, is more on the point.
If the speaking classs take into themselves all that is before, at the quality of a new level, I will be happy.
If we're all surprised and we don't know how, the new idea will be turned into a populary.
The JKH continues to remain one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
They have an impact on assets to the needs of a communal sector from various levels of budgets.
According to Genprocurature, the higher tariffs are one of the most exposed crimes in the field of JKH.
As a result, more than 170 million rubs were transferred to energy.
On the Days and Prosecutor of the Cross-Site, the facts of the inclusion in the tariff of unbased costs were found.
The costs of the OOO "IW-consulting" (as cool water) were placed on 4 million rubber on the car rent at the higher market price.
And such examples on the side of the mass.
The people pay the last money for the "communication" and make it right, according to the Centre of RF, the average collection of populations is 94 per cent.
It is accused of a number of articles of the Code of the Code: expenses, analysis of income obtained by crime, misuse of powers, etc.
According to the investigation, as the Chapter of the City Fund, Macarov concluded agreements with enterprises, works were actually not performed but paid.
Businessmen just returned to him most of the money.
And as a host of the UK, Macarov collected money from the population, but he did not provide services and lost them for his needs.
The injury of the budget and the jailers is millions of rubles.
Macarov's mixture scheme, weaves, typical for Russia.
The entire wallet of arrests and detentions of the UCs, which had contributed to the citizens' money, has been scattered by the country.
In Kamchatka, the proceedings of A. Kohan continued to be also the former deputy of the forest who is accused of 91.7 million rubs.
In 2012-2013, in the end of Elizabeth Kamchat, he established 6 managers and created 3 companies with responsibility.
One of them was undertaken to the UC, two other played the role of counterparty centres, which included money in the population.
However, the energy A. Lohan did not count the means, but he lost himself, the favorite.
Judging in the field of JKH is sufficiently difficult.
The works are not exciting, they're trained.
And "Good" in this extremely inhaled residential law, Sightlan Distortnev, the Executive Director of the NP "JKH Control".
We are not able to carry out one law, as we are thinking of a new one that must make the previous.
Specialists, including judges, are also few on the issues of the CAP.
The lawyers themselves recognize that the right to residence is very low.
The refuses to promote voting matters are also discussed in Genprocurature.
In 2015, less than half of the crimes were addressed in the court in 2015.
The rest of the investigation adopted a closer character and each fifth was stopped in connection with the uninstaled statements of the accused.
The lack of legal protection bodies are often included in white spaces in the current law.
There is a law, but learning bodies do not do so to excite and investigate such matters.
In the second half of 2015, there were approximately 230 reports on subsections - only 60 voting issues.
In the five months of the current year, their amount was only 99.
What is the fate of the protocol of the collection of bullets?
This means that the changes in domestic management, financial and other issues are to be addressed by the owners' opinions.
And that also means that the market of residence and community services cannot be able to try the standards of a company that wants to work honestly, not to "do" the population.
There is also a small and medium-sized business.
First of all, in the account and enhancement of corruption as such in all States, Anton Jarkov, member of the Committee on Propriétés.
And this work is now active.
It is not only a single action that is a targeted course for combating corruption.
Of course, not in all regions is such a cruel situation.
In particular, in the chair of scandals, it doesn't breathe.
Why is there no scandal in Moscow, such as in many other regions?
Since the steady Government had shown the iron will and made a series, " AIF " Anatolian Elector, member of the Committee on Security and Opposition of Corruption.
I mean, also, the Framework and the law amendments, and the legislation.
The supervisory supervision has been established for the managers, and all of them have passed through the license.
The worst worries are operatively resolved in the public area (and the treatment of wheels and the measures of reaction are placed at the portal of the Government of Moscow).
Many are not just paying monthly quotations, but carefully monitoring what is written in the house.
Awareness among the people about the rights of the owners and the obligations of resource-related and managing organizations is very high.
Plus Moscow checks the base of the tariffs on the residence-community services - because a lot of budgetary funds and subsidies and loans for numerous categories of populations.
This is probably all together and explains the calm situation in Moscow.
Does it seem that everything is inclined to the will of regional authorities?
Maybe the freedom should change the job?
Turkish gambit.
Can Erdogan reject friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey Redgep Tayip Erdogan has made the Ultimatum of the United States, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fethulah Gulen, the islamic preacher accused of the public turning organization.
He declared that by speaking to his sides in Ankara.
Erdogan invited the Americans to refuse the support of "the terrorists of the phethulahists".
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States call to change their position.
Experts believe that growth in Turkey and the West grows more and can lead to a new attempt to change authority in the country.
"Rano or slowly America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO ("Terrorists’ feethulahists").
Or organizing FETO converts, or democracy Turkey.
It must make this choice," quotes the Anatolian Agency of Training of Erdogan in Ankara midnight.
The President of Turkey for a series of times, but the United States had already needed to comply with the request that they first had heard after the pressure of the murder.
On 16 July in Turkey, highly established representatives of the Turkish Army were undertaken attempts to comply with the emphasis of the State's headship on the night.
Nevertheless, after Redzip Erdogan had acted on the road of the population, the accommodation was pressured and his organizers and participants were arrested.
About eight thousand people were suspicious, among which, besides the military, became teachers and scientists.
According to Redjep Erdogan, their teacher was Fethullah Gulen, who lived in Penhvania State in the United States.
There are also the parties of Erdogan that the hosts can be interrupted directly and directly by the Americans.
The United States had rejected all the claims to their address by refusing to issue Gulen and advising to change the tone.
The latest statement of the representatives of Mrsdep on this account was sounded at the visit of Erdogan in Sankt Peterburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not remain by the President of Turkey, but he insists on his own, and also calls for other western partners.
"And it will cease to carry out its obligations within the Migration Agreement with the Russian Union if Brussels does not call the date of the cancellation of visa for Turkish citizens," stated the Minister of Turkey on EU Affairs Omer Chelik on 9 August.
According to Ankara, the amendments to the anti-terrorism law, as the EU requires, will threaten its own security.
Let us note that, on 1 August, Germany's vice-concern, Zigmar Gabriel needed Turkey to stop the opportunity to open the border for migrants in order to facilitate the EU's visa regime.
His words became an answer to the corresponding statement of the Chapter of the Turkey Middle Mevlut Chavushoglu.
Another provokational statement of Chavushuglu made in the past environment, allowing Turkey to get out of NATO.
The Chapter of the Turkish MIDI did not exclude that the country would consider the possibility of exit from the Alliance if it had not met the expected support from it.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in defence sector is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign states in the defence sector - carrying rackets," Chavushoglu at Anadolu's interview.
According to Turkey, it is now necessary to create its own defence system on the basis of its technologies and to cooperate with other countries.
"To this couple, Turkey tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results were not satisfied, and we started seeking others," said the Minister.
Experts believe that this is all about the serious differences in Turkey with the West and the reorientation of the country to the East.
The Chapter of the International Institute of Political Experts of Minchenko believes that Redjep Erdogan is currently playing and cannot go to a serious conflict with the West.
He is very related to the West and the business, and from the point of view of the military (Turkey is a member of the NATO), therefore I think that Erdogan will try to equilibrate by keeping the frontiers with the West.
Although, of course, the Americans would be more convenient to see the post of a completely obedient person," explained the AIF.ru expert.
According to his statement, it is not excluded that after the statement of the Turkish leader (the non-payment of EU compensations, the requirement of an unvisual space with and the issue of Gulen from the United States) he will be pressed.
"Redgep Erdogan is confronted with threatening the country and America, and with a rose union, and they will press it on humanitarian, dictatorship methods and so far," Minchenko states.
The Chapter of the Political Information Centre of Alexandria Muhin admits that the President of Turkey changes its views in Russia as soon as it will be beneficial.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely cruel position against Russia and in all ways looked for kindness in the West.
The situation changed to the opposite at least a little time.
The guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change its priorities again.
I think Erdogan has entered the period of the diplomate.
When he is between two poles - West and Russia, he will try to gain a small benefit for himself," Mushin states.
It considers that the main task for the President of Turkey today is to maintain the political authority in the country, and for this, Russia and the partners with Vladim Putin to stop supporting the United States of Gulen.
Turkey also needs the EU and the United States who control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, the consensus with Turkey will be," says the expert.
The head of the Centre of Asia and the Middle East of Anna Glasov is held on another point of view.
Now Turkey and the EU and the United States are sufficiently stressed, and this is in the first place with the internal policy conducted by Herodogan.
I think that this crisis will be deteriorated, and at the background of this crisis, the Turkish guide will try to reload policy as well as in the Middle East as in Russia.
The President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish policies, claims that they are ready to change their position in a number of issues on Syria, resolved with Israel, and active political interaction with Iran," explained AIF.ru Glasov, which allows Argogan to be normalized with Egypt.
According to her, the political policy which is now conducting, is the return to the course of the concept that Turkey followed before the beginning of Arab revolutions.
"Therefore, in the place of "no problem with neighbors" Turkey began to develop very actively with the Middle East and Asian region.
The very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and the country have now passed.
Therefore, this external policy vector will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's positions in both regional and international areas," says the expert.
It considers that returning Turkey to the former EU will be incrediblely difficult, now the question is whether the EU will begin to respond to Turkey hardly, which can go to the opening of migrant borders and create the most serious challenges for .
Building of young doctors: Invitations to new collective protests
The representatives of the younger doctors invited the organization to sanctify new collective protests in their new work contract.
The Committee of Youth Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) will ask for its full advice to support more collective protests since September.
JDC says that the Minister was unable to answer the issues of the work agreement.
Young doctors and medical students vote in July for the cancellation of the work contract with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members, participating in the secret vote.
In a letter to the members of Twitter on Thursday evening, the President JDC Elena Court said that the Government continued to "short up" with the problems that, as she said, led to the derogation of the work agreement.
She said, "As regarding the committed situation, the JDC member voted for the rejection of the new employment agreement in full volume and invited the official repeated negotiations on all your issues."
In response to the silence of the JDC Government, the JDC held today an official request for the external meeting of the BMA Council to approve the continuous programme for collective protests extension from early September.
The opposite led to the participation of young doctors in six battles this year, including the first universal battles in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of the younger doctors of BMA, Dr. Joan Malavan, left after voting for the cancellation of the work contract, recommended by the BMA.
He said to BMA members that the agreement was a good deal to be taken during the vote meetings at 54.000 younger doctors and medical students.
After voting on Jeremy Hunt, the Minister for Health said that this working agreement would be used for medical agents in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Allians bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to take hands and announce the end of the eightmonth war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the golden holiday room in Sankt Peterburg, I had a sustainable impression that Anne wanted this reconciliation more.
It was handsome, yes.
But Mr. Pu's smile was looking at the swimming, and he did eat heavy even according to his own standards.
Redgep Tyip Erdogan, in contrast, spoke once of his "friendly second" Mr. Putin, five times, one report.
I lost the account.
He also promised that Russia and Russia would return not only to their doctrine, but even above.
On the day one newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's action as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was supposed to be back.
But the attractive cold that comes from Mr. Pu's presumed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in the introductional comments: Turkey fell a Russian destroyer at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was unusual.
Mr. Putin was disappointed by an angry tired by accusing Ankara to the Moscow hit in the coat.
It was even more spectacular than the prospected friend.
Rebuilding real confidence will be difficult, probably not.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
During months, MME States controlled have been conducted increasingly increasingly on Ankara.
It was suddenly seemed that Turks were to be guilty in all.
The most serious were the accusations of the representatives of the higher leadership that Mr. Erdogan's own family was on the illegal trade of oil from the Syrian zone controlled by the Islamic State.
He refused to reject it.
But in Sankt Peterburg, the official signal was made that the time was to move further.
Finally, this meeting was only because Mr. Putin received a excuse that he requested from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to vote on the winning of her kind.
For Ankara, the advantage of the declaration of reconciliation is clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all friends that he can receive, after he was almost surrounded, in the past month at trying to turn.
Re-Terrorist attacks on Turkey also appeared to be held.
There is also a economic reason.
The Russian sanctions have been extremely hit — especially the prohibition of cartridge flights, which usually bring a few million Russian tourists to Turkish every year.
The number of rarely falls by almost 90%.
What russians, tour operators and cartridge firms are here, of course, to be facilitated when the flights will finally renew.
They put the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
Even this week, the public television had predicted more fresh fêtes and fruits as only the Turkish imports of agricultural products would be allowed again.
"Turists there, swimming back here," as stated in the report in the newspaper of Witness.
But the visit also had an additional political value for Moscow.
And to the West because it considers an answer to the trial of turning.
Add to this the deficiency of its deficiencies with the best topics of accession to the EU and the step of Mr. Pu, which is seeking to be cold and gradually distorted in Turkey's connections with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus balls with Ankara for the invitation to support the selected authorities after the trial of public conversion.
Consider, this is a taxation for Moscow, which has its own deeply decorated fear of the change of regime.
In this brilliant holiday, Russia and Turkey allowed me to describe what one analytical described me as the "allians of the bad": two countries who feel open and humiliated in the Western are devoting forces.
However, despite the public manifestation of reconciliation, these two still have different differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently been a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are supporting opposers.
Perhaps itself says that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, until two presidents gave a press conference, they did not even interview this subject.
The President of Turkey was promptly avoiding the answer to their differences, while Mr. Putin had preferred to focus on them.
No clear agreement is how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after months of open enemy failure, and taking into account the possibility of a full disaster when the Russian reacting destruction member of the NATO Turkish member, it is better that two leaders at least speak again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for Scotland clients
Brand RBS must be taken to the role of the bank office, as stated by the Executive Director of the Bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for Scotland clients.
Ross-Evan told the BBC of Scotland that the RBS branch was with global bank ambitions.
The bank was dismissed from them since he almost moved eight years ago and needed to save them.
During this period, the farm iso-ispose's "RBS" to protect other consumer credit brakes.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsory assistance to the international aid from Cubka from six nations on the rebby to the campaign of William Andy Murrey.
But now it was determined that it was appropriate to allow more national brains to go on first.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scotland customers, but it will not be started.
In England and Wales, all references to the RBS, including the external office and the funding office, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and North Ireland.
There are other smaller, smaller breaches for the banking of private persons that will be more influenced by Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. Evan's interview during the tour of clients and in Invernessшир.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brand RBS will finally become our investment brand and the staff in which our staff will be occupied, because we are now in greater degree."
Since my bank is a global brain, RBS is a global brain.
I'm saying we've no global desires anymore, we've got a bottle of desires.
Each of these brains will represent something fully different in its population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these branches.
The RBS has already stated that it would not be to continue its sponsory support for six nations, and it has drawn up the profile of various brans in sponsoring.
"This is the right time for us to move the bridge bank, because we were basically asked how we focused on the improvement of the bank for customers?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cyclically three years ago if we said we were going to be a remarkable bank for customers and would close all these brackets.
But with what we did, focusing on customers' needs, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can return these brackets again, so I think it's the time that's right.
Detor Frances arrives to 3000 winners with winning in Newmarket in Pristrastia
Dectors broke the champagne after the dubble in Newmarket brings it to 3000 winnings
Jokey Franky Detory received his 3000 British winning in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this publishing note with his second victor at his home travel at Pristrastia, John Hosden.
The 45-year Italian is the sixth joke that has reached this issued note in glazing springs.
He follows Ser Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Idery and Willy Carson.
Three-fold campaign of Dettor's joke, who had previously wined Ghayar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I'm very glad that this happened in New Market, because I've been here 30 years ago.
It's not a big world business, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a normal Friday evening of 20,000 people.
I'm free of business and very unattracted.
Dectors take applaudations when the Presidency after winning
Two shookies have reached such signs in springs with obstacles: the campaign of Richard Johnson, and the 20-fold cluster of Ser Entonne, who had more than 4300 winning for the record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-fold Derby winner, 4493 victories in the career
Franks are one of the best jokes of modern times, and not surprisingly he has reached this note that so few had reached him.
He is a style and ≥ but his tactical laughing does not depart from others in the weight comma.
He is a wonderful representative for shopping, his enthusiasm and charism.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Eps, he would have brought 6000 winners if he wasn't just a shock of outcome and big shots!
And if serious, Frankie brought winners in Britain for a large number of 30 years, which is good to see.
He's a powerful person that's good for British springs, but more, he's an incredible joke.
Dettoria's Franks sent this issued brand to the company's strategy socket from the lodge
Franky Dettoria is a symbol of British hot shots for two decades.
They were shooting and falling.
A lot of winners of big shops, including its named "The Great Seven" in Ascote in 1996, but he also survived the aircraft and tried to discover due to dopinge.
Three years ago, he dreamed with difficulties when he returned after six months of discovery, but he showed a huge willingness to reject the calls of skeptics and to return to the form.
And he may not have ended for a while - Dectory said earlier that he would like to continue to participate in the conferences, at least until the age of 50.
Putin is released by Sergei Ivanov's Administration Chapter
The Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his head of Sergei Ivanov's administration.
Ivan was part of the confidential circle of Pu for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed as a representative for environmental and transport matters.
The claim from Kremla states that Putin " has made Ivan's debt free from his obligation to the Chapter of the Russian President's administration," but has not called the reason.
Mr. Ivanov's replacement, Anton Wyno, has been appointed as a recipient since 2012.
Mr. Wayno, 44, former diplomat.
It was born in the capital of Estonia Tallin in 1972, who was a prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MIMO) and served as a missionary of Tokyo.
Later, he was the head of the Office of the President's Protocol and the Government's equipment, reporting the Cremla Website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your confidence."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as heads of the State in view of the development of draft laws and control of how your instructions are fulfilled.
Putin reported to a Russian telephone on Friday that Ivan asked him to be released from this position and recommended that the War would replace it.
Do the Laughs Overwhelmed?
It's the wood that caused Moscow.
Sergei Ivan for a long time, I held one of the nearest sides of Vladimir Pu and, as he did, served in the Council of Security, the GBB.
As a head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At the meeting with President Putin, shown on public television, both men claimed that the head of the Administration was delayed on their own desires.
But despite the smiles of the camera, it's a little bit convinced here -- especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
Are these the unpredicted consequences of the fight against authority?
No one knows.
But the official statement is that a person who had ever acted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to manage the Russian environmental policy was met with a huge scepticism.
In the comments of Putin, quoted on the Creml Web site, Ivanov said, "This is the truth that I asked you to confide this very complex job at the beginning of 2012, even for four years.
Well, I may have been head of the president's four-year and eight months.
Ivanov entered into position in December 2011.
Earlier, he worked as a vice-premier minister and the Defence Minister.
He is member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the Government Security Service of the GBB as well as Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSA), who came to change the GBB, Ivan was appointed as its replacement.
When Putin came to the authority, he called Ivana among the five people he most trusted.
Sometimes Ivanov was considered to be the President of Russia after the second time of Pu, since the third time for Pu would be contrary to the constitution.
However, this post took another close party of Pu, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin’s Prime Minister before returning to the presidency after three and half years.
Tomas Gibson was released after dragging with a producer.
Gibson was a part of the taste on the show shows in Los Angeles last month.
ABC°os and CBS Television ́os, producing series, announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotcher, offered excuses on Thursday before it was declared to be removed.
There were creative divergences in the fractions and in the opinions.
I'm sorry about it," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson ' s person will be drawn out from a show that monitors the FBI agents' team, as it is expected, will be made later, according to the statements of ABC日os and CBS Television.
The 54-year-old actor, who had played a main role in the Darm and Greg Sitco, was in the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love thinking as a criminal and contributing my heart and soul in it during the last twelve years," said Gibson in his statement on Friday.
I hoped to be present in him until the end, but now it's not going to be.
I just want to welcome the scenarios, producers, actors, notes the team, and, most importantly, the best worshippers on which the show could only be moving about.
It is noted that the show returns with its twelveth season on September 28.
Register: Fisheries landed in Bunfa garden
A man from Banfa was seeking help to recognize fish that appeared in his garden in Banfe.
Kevin Baine believes that 75 fish could be fishermen left by water death.
Baine, 500 meters from the sea, gave the seed of this seat in Periscope in the hope that someone would be able to swim down the light for two-dum fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Puzzle is now associated with Fayf
The project of 1.35 billion pounds now must be finished until May 2017
The engineers have joined the northern crossing crossing, which means that the pool is now associated with Fif.
It's the first of the four thresholds between the "polotine winds" that are currently at the end of all three pills of the pool.
The Fif pool section is now 600 meters in length and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10 000 tonnes and 20 000 tonnes of beton and 46 tonnes of pool.
The project of 1.35 billion pounds must now be finished until May 2017.
The Ministry of Economy of Kit Brown has visited the field today and was among the first who were moved from the ground to the pool.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all the witnesses of the engineering experience in this project, where more than 30,000 tonnes of beton were used and only used to build this part of the pool.
Despite the massive size and weight of the pool, the finishing of the mixture between wheat and powder is a virtual operation with use of extremely precise evidence for collection.
In general, about 79 per cent of all the pool powder now, for the last section, the beton covering of the powder is currently in Rosacate, which means that it is all ready to get up to the pool.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Brie Constructors, said: "The first swimming on each building project is always a significant thing.
This is the most modern building experience in this project.
After setting up the last section of the road pool and joining it with the expanding North Piloon Road Pool, we remained closed the remaining lock on the north, or the road to the side.
This was made by the drafting of the northern approach to 700 millimeters southern.
It was a very exciting operation at the same time.
The mass is due to 222 meters long, weighting approximately 6000 tonnes and must have been raised up to the angle of the inclination of approximately 3 per cent.
It's amazing because the stakeholders on which the team worked were small - just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it's been very good.
Savior in Zalive Moelfree: Three men are "lucky to stay alive"
Three men were "happy to stay alive" after they were cast out from the fishing ship in England.
Moelfree RNLI was anxious at 13:20 at the British summer time on Friday after the team saw the event in Zaliva Moelfre.
Three men of all strength tried to reach a safe place while their ship continued to walk.
"We saw their ship round about them and assumed the worst," said Moelfree Vince Jones, the role saved.
"Happy, until we came down to water, the wind brought it to them," he added.
Two men were saved by a fishing ship, and the third men of 60 years were discovered incapable and imprisoned.
All of them were raised on the board of the ship of the rubber and delivered to the rubber
Jones said, "Tree men who were cast into the water have been lucky to be alive and completely unable.
The ship engine had a accidental swimming, but he was somehow dismissed from a man who managed the ship when she was wake up.
Somebody told these guys today.
Pokemon Go, worthy pleasure for health and happiness
It's amazing to watch the change of the world.
The fact that adults and children are no longer on the street to play, prefering their free time to look at the screen, was a complaint for many in the past decades.
Pokemon Go distracts people from the divan and involves some physical activity.
The time in the screen was originally played by television, then video games and recently smartphones.
It's so good to see that technology and the activity in the street are not being inter alia excluded.
I mean, of course, the totality of Pokemon Go applied on the basis of personalities originally created for video games in the 1990s (a series of multifilms, play cards and other replies).
Like many other pop-cultural events, all this has lost an earlier actuality before this new game was available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand on the beginning of July.
The charge in other countries was at that time detained in relation to the mass response that was transferred by the servers.
In the calculated days, Pokemon Go had more users than Tinder and almost the same as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, Smartphone players are going to search for Pokemons, followed by GPS, and, as found, can be "fotographed" (in your phone screenhot) or "po".
The generation that played in the game, as younger, has been attached to the full importance of the divans to search.
The game in the United States led to a significant increase in the number of steps passed by the "normal" person daily.
Cardiogram, an application for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently reported Washington Post that during two days from the start of the game, the number of followed people who had performed 30 minutes each day has increased from 45% to 53%.
The company doesn't know who is playing at Pokemon Go, it's just seeing the original levels of transition.
Many health care campaigns that make people "see 30 minutes", "resist from the divan" and "be active every day" have not found a response because most of the health care messages I'm being disappointed and reported to people who look unfortunate.
However, the importance of physical exercises is to undervalue.
Those who exercise the rule decrease the chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to correct weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokemon Go is that it's dragging people out of the street to do what they love.
Thus, there are three bases of health: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
People even bring new friends to the holiday.
Like usually, there are anxieties that look for what to regret.
And yes, someone can go to the door.
Well, what?
The break happened.
Despite the applications for smartphones, such as Fitbit, could earlier follow physical activity, they did not give us a behaviour of jobs as this game gives.
The news is swearing, and the use will be weak with time.
However, because of the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will unite applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good form and in health.

Simon Bailz wins absolute priority gold in the female gimnasia
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the fuck.
Simon Bayles is inevitable for all of this.
Dynamic on the opposite pig.
Unnecessary to be.
It's driving on the field.
Everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympical Champion.
The 19-year-old American gimnast arose to the title of the absolute priority campaign on Thursday, putting a fall between it and the rest of the world on convinced demonstration under the appropriate Olimpian attention.
Its general ball 62.198 was sufficiently removed from the silver medalist and companions on the Fine Petter's team, Ellie Rysman and the Russian Bronz Medalist of Alia Mustafin.
The Bailes from the United States would be at a gimnasty during the end of a woman's absolute priority on art-hymnastics in 2016 of the Soviet Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bayes became the fourth set of the American woman who wined the absolute first-party campaign and the fifth, strengthening her way as the best of her generation and perhaps anyway.
She was disappointed when her final general ball and its long travel has been completed.
This achievement puts it into the same line as exclusively rare light athletes, such as Michael Felps, who raised their species to new heights:
Byles has spent the last three years, dominating in its form by wining 15 medals of the world campaign - including 10 gold - with such spectacular programmes in their mixing of work and accuracy that Mary Louis Retton's Olympian campaign called "the greatest gimnasia that I've ever seen."
One last trial was waiting in Brazil, not as much between the Bayes and the rest in this field as between it and the burden of higher expectations.
Something less than going back to his family home to Spring, Texas, with golden medals, would be considered as the unfairest expectation.
Simon Bailes from the United States, left, and Ellie Risman is obtained after the winning of gold and silver respectively at the end of a woman's absolute priority on the artistic gimnasty at the Soviet Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Bailz for the first day of Tuesday, became a beautiful final accord for the forgiving party to the coordinator of the National Collection of Marta Caroly.
While Bailes claimed she had never seen the future during her long way to the top, it wasn't exactly that.
A part of its voluntary exercise programme is that includes its company traveling is set up in Latin America, which would come directly as a house in the street right behind the Olympian Arena Rio.
It's not coincidence.
The girl who was born by her grandfather and grandmother, starting to walk as a child and opening the mother of Amy Burman during a visit to a hall where Burman was a trainer, became a force.
She has not lost any absolute priority conference since 2013 — a lot of happiness that must continue as long as Biels wishes.
Although Mustafin had received a small benefit with two turns, it was a peace.
The kimnast is in the neighborhood and in practice — where Bailz protects the call of the world champion.
She went back from 15,433 to the B and ended with 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman was slowly covering it while they waited for a final account — pure formality — and the tears appeared around a blue and white and white undershadow for the Bales eye when the purpose that she had ever recorded in the album for scraping was about.
Raisman's statement was a little for four years ago when she shared the third place but lost Mustafin's brown on the Tai-Brake.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain of the Americans called "baby" was very far.
She sent the pool of the crowd after her free exercise, which was urged to return, which sometimes seemed to be subject to the question.
As a result of the Bailes, the 19-year-old virus twitter since the beginning of this week has now a new importance:
Police: 3 victims in the case of serial killer were shot during the hearing of the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most serious attack of the first serial killer of Phinix in the last decade, sitting in the car, talking and listening to when they were shooted, have been reported to the police reports held on Thursday.
Angela, Roshel Lanner, Stephanie R. Ellis and the daughter of Ellis, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked on the door, they declared authority.
The criminal made approximately eight shoots from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, then hiding on another vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police claims that the triple killing, of course, is not the result of the furnishment, because the malfactor did not take a bottle or $2.900, would have been available in one of the adult victims.
The police representative of Phinix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooter had encouraged the investigators to check whether he was with four previous attacks.
Seven were killed, and two other were hurt because of nine attacks in two primarily Latin American areas during four months.
"This happens in the yellow area before the house," said Howard KPHO, CBS branch at the beginning of this month.
The suspicious, as they think, was sprayed by several vehicles, including the root Nissan end of 1990s, the black BMW end of 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The followers refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that attacks between themselves and the same killers were completed.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with hurt and later ended.
Lyner, 31 years old, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were killed on the way.
The Witness told the police that there was nothing extraordinary in sitting in a parked car by listening to.
In addition, the report of the shooting police, which was empty for a half hours before a three-hour killing and which, as they think, was the case of a series killer.
The followers found the gels and removed the puzzle from the seat and the fragments of the puzzle from the engine range.
The mother of a six-year-old child with a microcephale: "He'll be better"
As the majority of six-year-old children, Edmund Pi loves singing, playing, and, of course, his mother.
But despite the majority of its companions, Edmund’s microcephalia is the result of a genetic injury that his mother Elizabeth Pi did not know during the nutrition.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do that.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign it.
What, actually, isn't true, you are, of course, signing on it," she said.
She and her husband told Vincent that Edmund might never know them and that he couldn't even survive.
Doctors even put it into a specialized treatment plant.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing this," said Pi.
Edmund's walking with the halls.
Edmund wasn't sitting, and he didn't use until he had three, and he didn't speak until this hour.
But he's slowly passing some of these.
He's walking with outside aid and walking on a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and songs.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund has invented for " Please join me."
"We teach him the language of gestures," said Pi'vovto CBS News.
But not just the common language of gestures, it says that Edmund has obtained its own gestures.
Microcephalia may result in a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections in the periods of absence of virus such as cora and Zeka.
Symptoms and prognoses may be strictly different.
Too early to talk about how it is said to live those infected by Zka virus.
Pi's memory of emotional loss because of an undetermined future.
I've always said what's going on?
What's going on?
And she doesn't know until this pool.
I actually didn't ask for a predict for the whole life, because I don't expect someone to really tell me.
But Pi has a hopeful advice for children's mothers with expected defects due to Zica.
It's gonna be better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You'll love your child, and your child's gonna love you.

Magazine Brown, 6 "shooted by puzzles", remains alive after the shot in Philadelphia
The police reports that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, registering the second shot at six-year-old city this week.
Grandma and grandfather recognized him for the CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Grandma and grandfather say that Brown received a lot of fire - wounds, including his feet, his feet, his hand and his life, but was in awareness when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He's got very much, his small body was solved by a pull," his grandmother Delores Melendez said.
I just can't believe that.
The boy is in the hospital in a critical state and has survived several operations.
The family said to the family that it was expected to be corrected.
He had to go to the first class at the main school.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in the Jermantown quarter.
Three men were also shot: two 29 and a 32-year-old.
It is reported that one of 29-year-old men is in critical state; two other victims were registered in a stabil state, the CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front seat of the car near the 29-year-old in the critical state, reporting.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police investigated whether any of the wounded men could be shooting.
The investigators reported the CBS Philadelphia that it seemed to have been a shot between several infected people.
The half-automat gels assigned to different exhibitors of semiautomatic weapons have established the place of action.
It seems that it was a continuous battle.
There were gylers on the street, both sides of the trottoir.
Therefore, at all, there were a few armed fighters and they were active in the shoot," reported Philadelphia's police captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Many houses and cars in this area were also placed.
No arrests were made, and the police, according to the reports, watched video surveillance cameras.
Another six-year-old child, a girl, was hurt in the hand of a school ball on Tuesday when she played before her home in West Oak Lane.
It's restoring, and the police still look for a suspicious.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Lori?
That's what I call the female Olympian collection on the gimnasty of this year and for several reasons.
First, I was at every Year Olympiade since 1984, and the United States had never been so dominant.
And second: in this collective key role, three gimnasts play: Simon Bailes, Gabby Duglas and Lauren "Laurie" Ernandes, who have already inspired so many small girls.
The composite of this assembly, supplemented Ellie Risman, which is a Jew, and Madison Koshan, a Catholic, encourages all to be proud.
This collection looks like America.
This has also strengthened the latin American female presence of this kind.
During the last four years, a female gimnasty number one was African.
Simeon and Gabby were No1 and No2 last year.
It's powerful.
In the past Olympiade, Gabby Duglas was an unexpected Olympic Champion, and America welcomed.
The world could now be a witness of the incredible expressions of the World Shame of Simon Bayes, Duglas and Lori Ernandes, which were unexpected but at least virtual hymnistic practices.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American team that wined gold in a woman's absolute priority.
And the College College Ellie Risman for silver.
We become witnesses of this kind of pizza, but it doesn't look like this in gimnasty sections throughout the country.
Simon, Gabby and Lori have all chosen the same way as Ali and Madison to train a Olympic Collection.
They are the "final five", because the Olympian assembly on the gimnasty will only have four gimnasts in the team, and this is the last year of Marta Caroly's training.
However, gimnasty is a delightful sport, and dreams are trained in private gimnastic clubs, supported by parents paying valuable training, basement, travelling, form, contributions for participation in conferences, hotel services (for trainers and their homes and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gimnastic clubs are distributed in rich village areas that can support this business.
These clubs are located where gimnasts receive everything from their training, and it is a dear and long-term responsibility for the family of gimnasts.
Amy Burman, the trainer of Simon Bailez, and Maggie Hani, the trainer of Laurie Ernandes, both trained their sportsmans since they were taken for gimnasty.
We must create more acceptable at the price and accessible education for the communities of a number of young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I found my gimnasty fund 20 years ago.
In mine, we have already provided free and unprecedented employment in Harlem for more than 15 000 town young guys (principally black and latin Americans) and have trained national and campaigns.
In September, we will extend to Detroit (My family city) to provide a high-quality gimnasty for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympian species.
Hymnasty develops strength, vitality and coordination for the body, as well as sustainability to exciting, discipline and sustainability.
This combination has a real impact on good health, success in school and success throughout the life.
The inspiration of this assembly will send thousands of girls to work with gimnasia, and it is.
It is so important, especially for girls.
That's a great time now.
Thank you, Simon, Ellie, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Power in the winning of the command of Olympy Gold and that you motivate so many girls of different origin to be healthy, rational and successful young women.
The younger doctors were to declare further deficiencies after the rejection of Jeremy Hanta's proposal
The Ministers hoped to conclude changes by making a changed agreement with the British Medical Association members, but 58 per cent of 37.000 young doctors who participated in voting were rejected.
In July, Hunt was planned to introduce this agreement, saying that NHS was on the " destructive land" and that any further delay would cause the staff and patients to be harmful.
The first younger doctors are transferred to a new treaty, which includes changes in work at night and outcomes to improve service at extraordinary time.
Dr. Ellen ́cott, president of the Committee of Youth Doctors," BMA, said last night in the statement: "The younger doctors still have serious concerns for the conduct of the proposed treaty, in particular that it is asking the crisis of slavery and that it cannot be applied righteously to all doctors."
There were only eight weeks before the first group of doctors was transferred to a new contract, progress and time at the outcome.
The trial of WMA to allow negotiations was met in an unwanted way to take action and sometimes full silence from the Government.
And this is, despite the promise of Jeremy Hant last month, that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Huntu needs to set up now, encourage the introduction and react to the threats of younger doctors.
If he doesn't, the younger doctors are uncertain that they are ready to organize the following battles.
After the finishing of April, the staff brought an approximately 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 nurses receipt, while nurses and consultants were held in order to provide a replacement of doctors on the piquetation line.
The Ministers hoped to conclude changes by making a changed agreement with the British Medical Association.
WMW wants a better payment for 54.000 younger doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Employers, invited younger doctors not to continue abusing.
Mortimer stated: "A little or nothing has been reached by the staff, but they are pressured on those who are already working on the front of the team and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disappointment to patients, seats and their families."
During the last two months, we discussed with the Committee of Youth Doctors, together with the Department of Health and other, locally answered their concerns, which cover the role of the guardians and corporate information policy.
The workers hoped that the continuing local approach on other important subjects — such as the distribution of staff, the ability of training, the additional training for those who return after a breakdown in the career, the value of training, the mutual recognition of the education plan, the academic discharge and gender differences in medical employment — were a sign of the serious workers, Health Education England and the Department of Health and the Department of Health were gathered to meet the conditions set out in November, February and May.
Medicinal treatment by 2 £ per day may reduce the threat of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attack are going to be used by a medicine at 2 pounds a day after the authorities recommended to give it to more people and for a longer time.
The opposite treatment of ticagrer reduces the risk of repeated attacks for people with heart diseases.
The medicine has already been appointed for 12 months after the heart attack, a reduced risk of consultation or a new attack.
The oversight of the NICE National Health Service of the United Kingdom recommended that it be granted to people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of heart-conscious problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service of the United Kingdom has now recommended that it be given to people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of heart-conscious problems.
The heart attack will occur with approximately 140 000 people in England each year, and the fourth of them will take place another attack or consultation.
Heart attacks and advice resulted from the creaming of grass material on the walls of artery and the forming of bottles.
If the flash is broken on parts, it can be the cause of a trombe that blocks blood access to the serum and causes a heart attack.
And if the troop moves, it will be able to move through the blood flow and block the blood flow to the brain by calling for advice.
People who have already reached one approach are subject to a greater risk of getting another.
The ticagrelor, produced by the British AstraZeneca firm and sold by Brilique, reduces the risk by making tromps less likely.
The project and action of the NICE, which has been presented today, recommends that people give 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirine twice daily for three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Centre, said: "Although the effective methods of secondary profile are available about the fourth persons who have already had a heart attack, another heart attack or inquiry often occurs with disruptive consequences."
The fear of repeat may have a significant negative impact on human life quality.
There are evidence of the fact that ticagrer in combination with aspirine is effective in decreasing the risk of cardiac attacks and investigations in people who have already passed a heart attack.
Preliminaryly recommending the ticagrelor, we are glad to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
Since information on the efficiency and safety of the ticagrelor — particularly the risk of blood flow — is at the end of three years, the draft and operation are not recommended to be treated for the longer time.
Culture of the CP is enabled to improve the faal of the counting of the votes in the Muslim areas
Ex-Mer Tauer-Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from the post last year because of corruption, using a soft report of the Government
The political correction culture led to the closure of the eyes, which was involving a total false of the counting of the votes in the Muslim communities, according to the devastating report of the Government that has been announced today.
The former member of the office of ministers of Mr. Eric Pickles is dismissed with a criticism in the field, the choice observers and the administration of the cities for ignoring violations testimony on elections because of the "religious sensitivity of the behavior of racial belongings and religion".
The former Secretary of Communities, now an anti-corruption king, reported that the fear of electors on religious ground was so strong that the police had to allow the assembly for certain electoral parts to protect the fearful electors.
He will allow electors to take the personal certificate to prove who they are when they vote.
Only the electors should specify their name and address at this time.
The report even brings unsuspended tissues on the fingers of people when they give their bulletins, in order to avoid that someone can vote twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to the reporters, said Ser Eric.
He invites the press to give greater access to the documents of the Council and decisions adopted by neon by the committees or by the slave groups.
"This is not only in order to protect the choices from the discipline, but also to protect the Government from the more open culture of corruption and financial force that comes with her hands," he said.
The report was ordered by the Douning Street by the vote at Tower Hamlets in East London.
In the past year, the Special Court discussing election issues stated that Mr. Luftur Rahman had to be mixed with a position in relation to long-term corruption and illegal activity.
The Court discovered that Rahman "chinely refused" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and that he was silenced by accusing them of racism and islamophobia.
Rahman, as said, "he took his campaign based on the obligation of the Muslims to vote for him."
Before 300 votes were doubted or were the result of the personality when a person voted, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there were a testimony of the potential throughout the country.
He expressed anxiety on the behavior of a proximity voting in which the elderly members of the Muslim community, as a communicate, pressed people to make those votes for the chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, on the graph, introduced a few recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the request of bringing his personal certificate to prove who you are
The report states: "The evidence of the pressure of some ethnic minorities communities shown on vulnerable members, particularly for women and youths, was presented, so that these votes would be in the will of elderly, especially in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
"They were afraid that... State institutions had closed the eyes of such behavior because of the "adequate correction" of the conduct of the adherence and religion."
Syr Eric & 50 Recommendations on the cleaning of the system, including the elimination of political activists from postal voting bulletins to stop "the voting collection".
The report also calls for adequate checks in the registration to prevent the use of the electoral pipe for immigration and privileges.
It is determined to require the voters to declare the approval of the person before the vote.
Use unfounded tissues on the fingers of people as soon as they throw their bullets to prevent anybody to vote.
To ensure that they have the right to vote systematic human nationality checks.
Enter a three-year vote on the automatic request for post voting.
Removing political participants of campaigns and activists from working with completed votes and conversions with post votes.
Give the police authority to set the borders around the electoral parts.
Amendment of law to facilitate the statement of accusations to the people in fear of the Representation of the National Act of 1983.
Make illegal graphing on election parts.
To make the requirement that only the English island be held on the electoral parts (excluding Wells).
Increasing training to ensure that the staff makes the voters go into the building on one.
Sir Eric is angry attacking the city field, stateing that it is "increasing" that no voting accusations have been submitted after Tauer Hamlets case.
"The Court discussing election issues, the discriminality of Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long range of corruption and illegality," he reported.
It was recognized to be guilty in the absence of a fundamental doubt — a criminal standard of evidence.
He also criticizes the "proof for the hall" of the electoral registration of town administrations.
Sir Eric stated, "The last year of the court in Tower Hamletse was a signal to wake up.
Our nation has a fierce inheritance as a mother of parliamentary elections, yet anxious and hidden spread of electoral power and with rejecting certain threats by the authorities of this good reputation.

Buy Primark about a woman who expressed a lower white in the middle of the store
Buyers didn't know where to take a view when a woman was borrowed to illustrate the shoes, at the stores in the middle of Primark.
Whatever worse, she illustrated how she looked in them, cut them down and put them back on the floor.
She continued to search, and at the outcome, four pairs of below white in the trade centre Bouverie Place in Falkstone.
The Primark Trade Centre Bouverie Place magazine in Falkstone, where a woman illustrated triangle trees before setting them back on the floor
The mother of the two children of Jenny Davidson, who was at that time in the magazine, said that after the example of the below white, a mysterious woman was "made again and went out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
When she stood in the middle of the trading room, she took a couple of sticks from the vitrine, took her own cups and cups and put them on.
" She didn't try to find somewhere a nice place to do this -- she just stood there, insomniate."
"All arose when she dropped her back, and they didn't like her because she put them back on the floor."
She did the same with three other couples before she decided that there was nothing that she would like, dressed again and went out.
"It doesn't seem to have forgotten her who watched her, or she thought about a person who would finally buy those chests she had illustrated."
The 33-year Jenny Davidson, from Kent, said, "How contrary to think someone's going to take a cup that someone else had already been carrying and they were not born."
The event occurred on Tuesday.
Davidson added, "I'm doing the conclusion that the staff, of course, tried to remove these objects of clothes from the sale after she went out, and so better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new couple of females and find out that the other woman took and took them away, and they weren't borrowed."
The representative Primark reported, "Primark knows about the event that happened in our store in Falkstone on Tuesday 9 August."
All of the goods about which and about which it is said have been excluded from the sale.
How to protect yourself from attacks with a gun using craw-mah
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help you make it a little safer.
We talked with Ron Mizrachi, the Master of the Craw-Make Federation in New York to find out how to cope with the inflammated captains nearby.
If they come to you forward or back, this video will show you how to kill the wall of his captor.
If they come back, according to Mizrachi, the first thing you need to do is to turn out so that you see the attacker and 'free the fire line'.
Then you put the gun strongly on between your front and your shoulder before you hit them in the face of a free lock.
Then the knee is in the rock, and while the attacker is thrown away from the pain, you throw the gun out of his hands, strike it in the face of the gun, and go back, hold the weapons on it.
For the inhibited, suitable way of executing it is to take your body out of the fire line, quickly put the gun and cut it out so that the guilty can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and hit the attacking bowl into the shoulder and then throw the weapon out of his capture before you go back and go on it.
Sounds complicated?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But remember that the safeest outcome from any furnishing -- if you're not the master of craw-may -- it's to give your freedom.
For the traveller, Ian Ryt is conducting his language in the most poor places
The British traveler undermined his immune system and a cruel reflection of serious trial, obliquiating some of the most cruel and reproached.
The leader and author of the books on the Travels of Jan Ryt, 51, from Saffolk, conducted the language on the banknote, the perils of Cirk Pikkadili, the button was mixing the unite in the train and the Russian public phone to demonstrate its immune system.
Before all objects were covered, he split the luminometre to show himself and us what it entered.
But an experiment that should be a film called "Ru's Traveller-Lizun's Internal Power" -- some wonderful results.
The idea of swimming the mouth button in a train used by thousands of others may be extremely disappointable, but actually the worst bacteria in the kitchen cancer.
During the entire driving of the Wright, he spoke to doctors and medical agents about the increase of the bacteria and its own health.
Fortunately, nothing of the knife has brought him more than a bad cup in his mouth.
White is tested by the promptness of his stick, traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public perils on boxes to the mixture button, this task, of course, led to its immune system
In the movie that he took, he said, 'I was completely unseen by my health, and I made many things in the mouth of the earth, eating red and thirsty water.'
Of course, he proved his way during the movie.
The only thing he refused is a russian public toilet.
His test breast demonstrator is a value of a luminometer exceeding 4000 units.
For comparison: just the hands cut out must be within 60 frames.
But there was a Russian public toilet that he refused to oblique after the importance of his luminometra was more than 4000 units, while the hands were cut down by less than 60.
Wright and the Finnish milk products manufacturer of Valio have filmed a traveler named "Ru's Traveller-Lizune on the Internal Power", which demonstrates the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the toilet
In the movie he said, "This is near to one of the worst things that I had cut in the toilet."
There's nothing worse than that!
I'm not going to stumble anything because it's amazing.
The "Ru Traveller-Lizona for the Internal Power" was compiled with the Finnish milk producer of Valio.
The Company for Rayto Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygen bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, in order to contribute to the growth of human bacteria and to develop the immune system.
The senior Vice-President Valio on shoes, socks and new category Niko Worenmaa said: "We really wanted to offer a new thing to the consumers.
What would be interesting to see and could explain the benefits of the antibiotics at the same time.
We had a brain storm that ended with the idea, "Let us call Jan."
They acknowledge that the interest in the health of the clipboard is global
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to put them in a large context: good and bad bacteria in our whole-day environment, the importance of the wallet health and how it was with the immune system.
Increasing interest in the health of the clipboard is a global manifestation, and with this documentary film, we have been able to provide more information to the consumers in a interesting form.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good feeling of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was a film recorder, added: "Let us say, I would lose respect for Jan, if he had cut off some of the things I asked, such as a disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie."
Of course, some of the things of Jane was easier to cover, and some were quite cruel.
I'm glad that some of these obstacles have been able to get in prison.
In the 2015 investigation of Valio, 84 per cent of the representatives were associated with oxygen bacteria exclusively with good iron and cup, and 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes products containing added oxygen bacteria.
The family of Huligan was Saltash, the municipal house of Cornuol
The Huligan family left its municipal house with 50,000 pounds of deficiencies after they were exhausted for fear of their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shane Trebilcock were threw out of their object of unnecessaryness in Saltash, Cornual, after a long pig complaint against them.
After they were obliged to be removed from the object of immobility, the shocked operators of the building workers discovered this object in the condition of reconstruction.
The walls were left with winters, halfs were covered, the walls were split in the field, and the walls were packed with graffiti.
The family is now moved and it implies to live in a private apartment
Donna Evie, a divorce in Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid not to save him.
She said, 'This was a absolute cosm for people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There are many things that must be taken into consideration because this object of immobility will probably be as not very good as Cornelius.
This family uses foolish glory, and their name uses foolish glory.
A couple of three sons who lived in an immobility for a while, and the police reported that the kingdom of a horror that is called for a family included dracks on the street with baseball bits, fearing the people of nearby areas, drug use, drug trade, excessive cries, disputes and arrogance.
Skeldon, 47 whose name was in the arrangement contract, received an antisocial behaviour in June.
In a number of rooms of houses that may be brought up on an old master
Field tables in the house where drugs were sold in the past were removed
Neighbors say they have seen dracks on the street, and they have called a pool
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner from home this week, after they had been granted a long period of 11 weeks for voluntary exit.
It was facilitated to welcome neighbors who said that their lives had been transformed into a deep fire.
One said, "They didn't worry about anyone."
We lived near them 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the pool here, it's incredible.
"This morning we couldn't sleep."
We arose because there was so quiet, we didn't have to do that!
Now when they finally left, everything will be done.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a member of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood group, said that the family did not agree to cooperate with the authorities.
Family lived in the house of 20 years, with a half years of age, and to that rule, a half of
Museum and old games were released below the increasing side of the municipal house
He added: 'This is a shame that the pensioner was not able to accept any responsibility for her and her family's behavior, since the exhibition is always the last method of dealing with Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, since the behavior was limited, and their actions must have been terrible for her neighbors.
I appreciate the whole of my team, police and members of the community of Devon and Cornuola, who were courageously expressed to give us information.
I hope that this development will give the neighbors a little comfort and send a signal that social behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house for a different time, but he said that they had a little more than twenty.
An horrible matrace remaining on the field in one of the burned houses after the rest
The workers of the division will now have to remove the tissue that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police made a search in the house and found more than 70 g of canoples, as well as the weights of the corresponding belongings and 1700 £ available.
Scheldon was traffed after he recognized himself to be guilty of the ownership of Class B for the supply.
She claimed that money was paid for her son, Lee Skelldon, who died in the car disaster in 2013.
After making them homeless, there are information that Tanya and her partner will now be in Plimote.
The walls of many camels of the house were packed over the surface.
Police says that they will strive to deploy pensioners that are not subject to the rules of the rental
Angel Crow, from Devon and Cornual police, stated that this population sent clear warning to others who continue to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they can be conducted without the accusation of the accuser, and for those who bring such behavior', she said.
Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be allowed by Devon and Cornual, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Turists in Portugal came to a terror when a lower warfare plane did not touch the beach
Tourists who worshiped the sunrise in the city of Ayer in Portugal feared their lives
Aeroplane P-3C Orion military-air forces Portugal passed incrediblely low
Military air forces reported that he was running a training plane, but insisted that there was no security risk
This is the moment when fearful tourists begin to panic, while the low-speaking aircraft is over the overflowed beach.
On dramatic frames, a military airplane is seen that is almost flying at the distance of the cashan from the sand of the Ayer, north Portugal.
The reliefs arose on their feet as soon as they were inquired of the aircraft’s engines, but there was no possibility to see that it was moved to their side through the cloud.
The incident occurred yesterday evening near the city of Ayir in Costa-Nova.
Daniel Fernandas, one of several relaxants, who on-shocking videos in the networks, said, "His flighted lowly twice, and it was a moment that it seemed to be disturbed."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was doing a serfine and I swear, there was a feeling that the plane would fall on me."
The tourists on the beach of Ayer were terriblely scared when the airplane appeared out of the tunnel and passed to a extremely low height
Today, Portugal’s military air forces stated that the P-3C Orion airport pilot had performed a training plane to find fishing vessels at the Âg, and it had to be so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said that the airplane was a little lower than usually because of the insufficient visibility caused by smoke from the nearby forests, but military air forces claimed that no one was subject to dangers.
In this year, forest fires caused damage to the material part of Portugal, as well as to the lives of four people on the island of Madeira.
Portuguese military air forces have made today a statement that the pilot had to fly so lowly in the power of circumstances — a thick dust and smoke from forest fires that have deteriorated the visibility
The flight was running a train flight, and the pilot was ordered to find fishing ships in the field of the task
The "HAS" system has been committed to society for more than a year, but most of the coffee and restaurants of Peterburg have not entered it until this hole.
The checks become more active and the business is threatened by the shops of up to 1 million rubles.
Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian HASS option) is an analysis of risks and critical control points. It is committed to the application of food producers and carriers, as well as companies in the area of society in Russia, as member of the Tamothy Union.
The business checks of the Rose Surveillance on the conformity of these standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
However, until the factors are printing the ships only for the violation of the regulation (see "Review of documents"...).
However, the failure of the Regulation in general will be acquired by 600 thousand rubles for the first infringement and 1 million rubles for the second.
HAS; as a system of risks regarding food products and preventing them, in the 1960s were invented in the United States.
Then it was about the safety of food for astronauts.
The system is currently used for all food businesses not only in the United States but also in Canada and in the Russian Union.
Since February 2015, HAS operates on the territory of TS.
The business system was once 4 years (HAS needed in 2011).
However, the firms themselves and the factors recognize that most companies have not even heard of this.
Unfortunately, we had long been sure that the standard was covered only for food products, not for restaurants, - explained the Chapter of the Common Council of Elena Center.
Now everyone's trying to overcome what's lost.
The expected time for renewal of cartridges to Turkey - the end of August - beginning of September.
But they won't call for an age question, because their target audience is a family with children, they're already ready to school, and they're noticed by experts.
The Tourist Agencies Allians sent a letter to the Government and requested to allow charters now.
"For many Russian tourists, the question of choosing quality and available marine rest is unresolvable, since the courses of the Cross-Country and the Response of Creme are already banned until the end of September," commented the writers and stressed that the opening of cartridge in August does not affect the already-committed question on the Russian marine tourist.
As reported in the North-West Regional Effect of the Russian Turing Industry Union (RST), where Russia and Turkey’s airports are quickly agreed, renewal of cartridges to Turkey can be expected for a month.
A clear understanding of the renewal of the charters until not, this depends mainly on the aircraft authorities.
Technically, aircrafts may fly in September, even August, even if tour operators are operatingly building programmes and agreed with aircraft companies on the needed boats," says Paul Romancev, Vice-President of the Communications Director and the projects of North-West Regional Agency.
He said that the potential renewal of charters is good news, but it is not too affecting market forces, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from relaxing and prepared to school or run a vacation in other countries.
At the barhate season, the tours are mainly solemn travelers and couples.
The programmes can be calculated on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously," says Paul Romancev.
"Turkey has the opportunity for many tourists if she now gives a very budgetary proposal - 50-60 thousand tours on two, because there are people who are in a position to wait very hard tours," says Valeria Rosental, Director-General of Optio-Travel.
In other cases, it is not worth recalling that the basic mass of travel has already been planned.
Paul also believes that, since there is a question to Turkey in order, the charters will also be struck, but the engineering is not worth waiting.
"For Turkey, the turnover of charters now is the repetition of the season," says Paul Romancev.
"The opening of charters in Turkey is a new news for the season," is Valery Rubtz.
The Tax Code provides freedom from NDFL by compensation payments established by the NDFL in certain terms of remuneration of a refund caused by an increasing or other health damage.
The issue of milk to employees under work conditions is provided for in Article 222 TK RF.
The same standards and conditions of delivery are established by the proposal of the Rusland Minus Research of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, free delivery of milk or other equivalent foods is produced to the employees at the time of employment at work with the conditions of employment provided for by the slave.
From those standards, the Russian FNs concluded that at paragraph 2 p. 3 of Article 217 of the CNRF, the income of NDFL is released from the cost of milk issued to the employees in the days of work with normal conditions and conditions provided by the Rusian Minastress Development of 16,02.2009 No 45n.
The Moscow Gasstructbank remained without the CB license.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia denied the licence for banking operations at the Actionary Commercial Bank's Action Bank, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, the ACB " GASTRAYBANK" has conducted a highly risked credit policy with the distribution of money in low-quality assets.
Adequate risks to be taken by the supervisory body and a valid reflection of the value of the bank's assets have led to the credit organisation for measures to warn bankruptcy.
Furthermore, the credit was held in the implementation of suspicious transit operations.
The bank has appointed a temporary administration for the time before the nomination of a competitive manager or liquidator.
The full appointment of the credit institutions in the Federal Law has been suspended.
AO ACB "HASTRAYBANK" is a part of the investment insurance system.
On the basis of the payment of the insurance payment to the banks, including individual undertakers, in the Federal Act No. 177-FZ " The insurance of the contributions of the persons in the Russian Federation banks" is 100% of the rest of the funds, but not more than 1,4 million of dollars in total on one tab.
The payments of the contribution insurance agency shall be started not later than 26 August 2016.
According to the report, the AO ' ACB ' s assets had 335 places in the RF banking system on 1 August 2016.
The London School, attending IHIL, died in Syria
Cadiza Sulthan, one of the three British schools who left London last year to join IHIL, as reported, was dead in Syria.

In February 2015, Sultan and two other schools from Eastern London bought a flight to Turkey and then to the bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family said she was married to the IHIL fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.

Treats states that erotic calendars for "women, as well as men"
The Traats magazine works with David Belmer's graph to release a calendar for 2017 inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of deceased names, they are aimed at finding a more popular generation of top models for their calendar for 2017 with discharged museums.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a large number of models is different from old-mode Playboy, because "Playboy" is for men.
I'm doing it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar too.
"We need to return to the demonstration of the eternal and the class of the deceased figure where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these women's body," said Shaw in the press relizing statement of the calendar.
Women will be part of this project because it is a result of experience.
Models can provide online graphs or personally on open casinos in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow's memories of non-conscious internet stores will be given to the Moscow.
In Moscow, they are going to release a memory that will tell us how not to be a Internet store victim.
It was reported in Rose Nauru, M24.
It is reported that science specialists are preparing a memory that helps citizens to choose the Internet store properly and to recognize the needy schemes.

In Moscow, Ernst Ne's memory was a night.
In Moscow, the memory of Ernst Nego's sculptor has been reported to the TAS.
The business will be held on 15 August in the Central House of Letters.
Unfortunately, not everyone can forgive Neo in the United States.

The final consumer was guilty: Who actually buys plastic?
Only men of the middle-years love guilt.
And until you have stopped to break a section of commentarys with the puzzles of the NevisOnequity Pseudone, that is, the fact of the data.
YouGov said that so much regeneration of plastic is not a bum among the two-thousand generations that want to be a new material item, but a nostalgie of the average years.
Those who have recently purchased a vine album with a large share of the probability are from 45 to 54 years old.
Besides, those who belong to a 18-24-year-old group are less likely.
It is also not simply the work of the assembly of lovers - it has a emotional importance: the older buyers have been guilty of a few more likely to keep their feelings in themselves (56 % against 53 %) and enjoy unity (69 % against 66 %).
But do I have the results of YouGov faithful?
If this blog was a television news reporting, the camera would follow me until I was going through the centre of the Soho survived street, in a low costum serum and a huge gesture before the rest, putting hands and saying something intriguing, "Yes, let's see."
Yeah, let's see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly differing from its charming and grass — hotels, coffee, carriers of Paperchase have now completed opinions, some of the independent sellers have still remained.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the scene in which I am near to different people in some of these magazines and try to evaluate their age and emotional attitude by monitoring.
Glasgo Stuart, 55 years old when I went from Sister Ray (consumption of data: two young women, three men of age) to Reckless Records (consumption of data: eight men of age, one woman probably more than 20 years) in London to attend the meeting, and is switched on the stores to take a few hours.
He's a collectionist, do I ask?
"I guess yes," he says.
I have approximately 3000 or 4000 plastic.
These pictures above (he sent me by the e-mail photo, I didn't follow him home) go through lines on the walls of his guest.
His reason for obtaining such a large number of albums and songs is part of its income: he can now buy plates that he could not allow himself when they came out and redeem the items that he sold when he was young and on myself.
"A lot of what I get is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, the things that went out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
It is that those who buy plastic are probably the introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my lack.
Weez, 25 years old at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meet correspond to YouGov's profile.
However, he noted a new whale of people under the impact of the sounds in the MMI, people who heard of the return and feelings of the obligation to purchase their old plastic.
In view of what I had, people were generally released from their collection in about 1998 or 1999.
The clients who ever sold their guilt to buy a disc-compact now sell their compacts to redeem their plates," he says.
This can explain the bum among the rebuilding factors of a certain age.
What about the emotional importance of the plastic?
It is enough to take a few seconds in the magazine, such as Phonica, to understand that plastic stores have a comfortable society of people with similar views.
Weaza said that some older customers, in particular, are in the infinite payment system.
Lovers of the guilty may feel as a result of digital peace and prefer to be removed into the continuity of known conversions for the plastic, objects that prompt memories of the immortal youth.
"I think that it may sometimes be the full of an empty or an area of material things as its kind of calm," says Weez.
Because I'm a collector, I have it, and I think many people have it too.
It's a simple way to take your own.
"We are their architects!" said a colleague from the plastic steel.
The ICM question in April showed that nearly 50 per cent of people who purchased a vine album last month had not yet listened to it.
The question also discovered that 41 per cent had losses that they never used, while 7 per cent of those who purchased the guilty did not have a plastic player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously disappointed by providing a stealing with the assemblies of Bosnia.
"Trofein" and "Regeneration" is what Johnny noted, 42 years of age, who works in Sounds of the Universe (of the data: three middle-year men).
"Nobody came and said, "I don't have a plastic player, but I want to buy a radiohead plastic so that we can put it on our own," he says.
It's not a big percent, but that's definitely happening.
More manufacturing products, less.
We have people who say, "I have no plastic player."
They're younger, not older, but fewer than twenty, who only know it.
Fopp, who has taken almost all the vineyards now, has a much more different audience when I come.
There are couples who are 70 tourists who are graphing, breast-feeding boys and women of the middle-years.
Although the atmosphere is less unnecessary than in the above stores, the last synth is Wild Beast, not the jazz improvization, it is a pleasure to see the diversity in its customers.
No one of them looks especially alone, but a painful psychological trauma is difficult to fix 30 seconds near someone.
Eleonor, 27 years old, has spent a few minutes on Fopp, considering the different plastics in the sale.
She's looking at goods, not to lose money.
She doesn't work much, according to her words, so collecting the plastics is not very suitable.
It's worth it.
The computer or another device is simply, but the beauty is...," it is threatened with an inspired love.
I don't know how to explain it's really unrepeated.
After the rest of me, it is a store that, as they say, has contributed to the presentation of a new generation of favorites, who is guilty of the city models.
As long as I create an illusion that I'm looking at the gentlemen's cocktails, I'm watching a group of female girls, each minute gathering around the Polaroid camera before my father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of the Crosley player.
The left is a step wall placed by Adel, Jeff Bakli, Amy Waynehous and Flitwood Mc: a mixing of modern style and classic, a commitment for any average collection.
No one looks at it, perhaps because they're simply beauty, some are so highly resolved on the wall that it would not be able to touch them.
It's a real "wonderful guilt".
However, given that any attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the Soho depth for a while, almost nothing to complain.
It is not surprising that the layer of a population with more likelihood than most of them has more time and money than most of them is the layer that loses most money on the subjects of the rocks, such as the guilty.
But while my conclusions testify that YouGov's results are precise, at least in the Soho plastic stores, they do not exclude the great number of women collectors and famous guilty guilty who are actually in plastic stores and online forums.
These people probably work at school or offices.
But they are not clearly running on Thursday morning by walking through the bars of the bars on Berwick Street, spreading the plastics and avoiding the views of a 30-year-old uncomfortable false leader, which depends on the heads of no suspicious men of the middle-years.
Greenland on the aquale — the most long-term animal — video report
Scientists claim that Greenland has the maximum duration of life from all those who are on the planet.
Julius Neilson, who studies these accumules, states that the record has placed an age between 272 and 512 and five metres long
The French Court rejects the proposal to bring a store in the refugee camp of Jungle
The French Court rejected the proposal from the authorities of Cale to bring up tens of self-markets and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees are.
At the audiences of this week, Kale stated that the State should be able to carry 72 self-shops in general where people in the camp sold goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, waste or sell the tea for 50 cents (40r) or a few feeds for a few in self-restaurants.
Prefecture Cale said that these places should be from ≥ because they are a parallel economy that does not bear taxes and because they have fire and health risks.
The humanitarian groups reported to the court that the stores and restaurants are living by claiming that free feeds, which have been associated with an intergovernmental association and other groups, do not provide enough food for the existing number of foods in the camp.
They claimed that the stores and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those who need it.
The Court of Lilla stated that there was no legal initiative to exit people who were managed by 72 self-determined magazines, but said that the prefecture problems of Cale were "comprehensible".
Judge Jean-France Molla said that the bacalias, coffee and restaurants played a lot of role than just the food of people who "live in extreme conditions".
He said that the spaces were at the peaceful points of refugees and volunteers meetings.
One of the threatened breast-feeding coffee was a book of Jungley at a camp that works not for benefits and works for 200 beds on the day, in English and French, and in consultation on the delivery of a refuge for hundreds of vulnerable non-satisfactors without conducting the camp.

British remains in the regby-7 silver after Fidge class master allows them to take gold.
The impressive series of Britain in Regby-7 was constantly stopped by Fidge team finally on Thursday evening when they were completely disappointed at the Deidoro stage here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class for the possession of the ball, the shipment, the decline, the support of the game, the escape of the lines and the back of the power to win the gold -- their first olympical medal of any color.
The damage was not too poor comforted in the form of silver — the third in Britain per day — and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympian tourist on Regby-7 where they won New Zealand, Argentina and Southern.
Boks painful killing, 7-5 in half-final earlier on the same day, could be returned to say negatively on them in the final.
But, despite anything, Fiji in such a way won as a better team of 15 people.
This may be a few comforts for the United Kingdom — but probably not — that at least one British will weigh on the neck of the golden medal tomorrow: the main trainer Fidji Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon.
It was a way for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost each game on Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost one.
These attacks will cause pain, but the progress is racial.
Fiji started greatly for the pleasure by refusing Britain's attempts to catch the ball.
It was like to hang on the movement buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the world series campaigns moved up to 5-0 when Osea Collissau switched into the angle.
With four minutes at Jerry Tuwai's hours, he added another tachdaun on the right floor that was disappointed.
12-0 and British Eady touched the ball.
The great attempt to overcome Mitchell has kept the Leon Mountains to kill the third, but it just stopped Fidge.
In the seventh minute Jass Veramalua made a tachdaun in the right corner, and the United Kingdom lost 17-0.
He added another after the renewal, and there were still more minutes... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo was then broken through a few more large attempts to capture the United Kingdom and took a line to get a point.
The implementation led to 29-0 in a break.
It seemed as if Fiji were born for the game in Regby-7 while the United Kingdom still dominates the remess.
What is significantly so.
Great Britain made massive replacements for half the game, and they purchased a fidge damma... for every four minutes that was good at the first half standards until Joshua Tuisova passed after several flashing fidge interactions.
Dan Norton has made an attempt to British by making a tachdaun in the left corner to account 36-7, but the game has long been on the road of the island -- the South Sea, whose fans sing, broke flags and dance on tribes.
It was impossible not to excite full joy by Fidge's approach.
The mother of William has cut off the Fidjian tort, which was not needed to be trained, another attempt in the last seconds.
It sounds like a bridge, the Fidjians were covered, and the United Kingdom fell on the gasoon, full of victory.
At the same day, Fidji won Japan 20 to 5 in their half-final, and the United Kingdom had a little sealed the South in a pressed half-final attempt for each, the difference in the British Disposition.
Kyle Brown's carrying Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, using a wonderful work, broke a line and killed the balls in the second half.
The 15th part of the team of England, Anthony, after trying to capture Markus Watson, protected the victory — and finally counted the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Hesser Stanning were inspired to win the cruel trener's fight against cancer
There'll be no more interesting gold on these games, and it's talking about something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 hard sums in the history, Helen Glover and Hesser Stanning found an additional importance of their golden moment at Stacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two weighters, there were three votes in this ship, the echo of Robin Williams was always until they tried to the second subsequence of Olympian gold in women's couples, the first women in the britain's annals that reached that height.
Their excellence was absolute, finally their 39th unexpected statement was again unprecedentable.
What we see, two flashing sports, which are on the surface with the elegantity of lebs, are not completely reflecting the nature of triumph.
After every golden tube, the batallon prepared hands that contribute gradually to growing wins that have a importance and no hands that were more important than the trainer’s hands who had been diagnosed 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would live before he was seeing this day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had the cancer of a mosque puzzle, which is one of what they could operate, and they did it.
If they do not, he's everywhere.
It could be a lot of bad situation.
She's changing your species for the future.
Williams were diagnosed in December 2013.
Three have been lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, keeping the graphic breaking at minimum if it could be a real expression in such circumstances as these.
I needed a payment, so I needed to fix quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and played 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet per time, although they talked enough for a few steps.
That's how it starts.
It's a trip on itself, but it makes it a little more.
At a closer moment after they had won, their first thoughts were about Williams, who had been nervous in the morning, talking almost more than usually in trying to overcome their own anxieties.
Stanning, Captain of Artileria, with the office in Afghanistan, said, "I was a emotional devastating this week, perhaps a little cherry, but that means so much."
It just confirms how much it means for me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin too.
It was three years of statistics with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nobody, so thank him greatly, he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner for training or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Hiser Stanning haven't lost any trap in five years.
This couple provides a stressed rythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 meters when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to reach, Stanning and Glover had too much stock.
We were very in the phase.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
You're not really important now.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do something like that.
We weren't waiting for the feedback today, but we just waited for a good whistle and to go out and win that ship we did.
Pairs will need a year to decide their future.
The Glover must be at the wedding in the last month, at its own television investigator, Steve Beckshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn't want to say that it was my after it was a gone.
That would mean too much pressure.
I needed about six months in London to realize that I was a Olimpian campaign.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed.
There's been about four minutes here.
I feel so much better," she said.

How Bangkok was in a extreme position
In January 2014, the Government of Thailand announced the introduction of an emergency position in Bangkok and the provinces' capital.
The special regime was 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in Bangkok's center, at the Conquist Monument, where one of the main protest actions had been carried out, two explosions, which resulted in 28 people, and five of them were in critical situation.
Insufficiencies have been produced in the moto.
The authorities strengthened security measures in the capital and attached military forces to protect demons.
In Suh Loge, there was a beginning of a time.
As " E", the Government was proposed to make a project of an auction on the golden-road place of the Suhai Log with the preservation of two key elements.
The accommodation is not allowed to companies where 25% and more belong to foreigners, and those who have no capital of at least 25% of the host.
Adults do not expect the Government to rewrite the conditions, noting that many players do not risk taking place as a complex and dear project.
Auctions can be announced in August, and conducted in October.
Min Natures introduced the Government a draft allocation and aid to the most recently used golden residence in Russia Suhay Log (Irkish area, stocks and resources – 130 million untions), reported two sources of " E" known to the situation.
The project has been introduced in midnight, and it is exactly one of them.
In Min Nature, "E" confirmed that the project was introduced to the Government.
The Representative of the Netropolitical Vice-President Alexander Hloponina said "E" that the project has not yet been done in the maintenance equipment.
"Auction may be declared already in August, as well as after the Government ' s release, and with a view to the collection of applications for potential participants (not less than 45 days) the tender may be already held in October," says Min Nature.
According to the " E " project, two key requirements for potential participants were maintained in the option, which was sent to the Ministries and FOIVam in July (the " E").
First of all, the presentation in the capital of the candidates is at least 25% of the ladies.
The second is the refusal of access to awards for foreign investors under control, resulting from the understanding of FZ-57 on investment in public society.
According to the two articles of the draft FS, as already written on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent of the above) are not subject to tax residents of RF or have double citizenship.
The Government is enabled to introduce such instructions, since the Suhay Log is at the end of the federal value (reserves exceeding 50 tons of gold).
In Min Nature, the project " will contain foreign companies ' , but refused to comment on details before the Government ' s disposal.
The request for the hospitality in the capital of the auktion participants made the Irkutian region, in December 2015 " U" in Min Nature, and confirmed later the Governor of the Region of Sergei Levchenko, noting that it was addressed to Min Nature, his former president Sergei Erohonko, "the investment agreement with the " Roschech" projects."
Who's lobby foreigners' visits are not accurate.
"But this is in the spirit of the time: no control in the largest place of gold in Russia on the background of west sanctions," considers the interviewer "E", known for the preparation of auktion.
The Chapter of the Min Nature Sergey Donny, 1 August, stated that foreigners " could go to the consortium," if the claimers would attach them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
The " A" convictions are not likely to address the conditions in the Government.
The basic candidate on Suhai Log in adults considers the consortium of the greatest golden shipment RF PAO " Polos", the subcontrol son of Sule, Carimova Saida, and "Rosheha".
As he wrote "E", partners created "SL Gold" in July, where "Polus" is 51 per cent below, and the "Rosheha" structure is 49 per cent.
"Rosheheh" refused comments, "Polus" stated "E" that "inclusively interested in this asset" and the assets and all the powerful competences and resources for its development.
"But the decision on the possibility and form of our participation will be taken after the declaration," added the "Polus".
ALROSA can participate in the auction, but the RF Government's decision, the sources of " E" were spoken.
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which develops assets on Chuckoca, stated that the Polymetal and Nordgold were not interested in the active.
The Chapter of the RF Sergei Casuba's gold industry in December 2015 invested "E" in Suhay Log in $2,5-4 billion.
Most potential candidates refresh not only the amount of investment but also the complexity of the project: a serious investigation of stocks and technologies with complex rounds, explaining "Y" in adults.
On the pension market, the largest M&A transaction, "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" started the process of merger of four subcontrol NPFs.
As a result, the Gasford Pensional Cookies will be created by NPF with an amount of approximately 373 billion rubs.
On the initiation of the procedure for the jointing of four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Pro-Fond", "Ereficiency" and "Gasfund Pensions" - the owner of the OO 100% of the Pension Administrator reported yesterday.
The company report says, " The Reglementation on Construction with the CB is in respect of the requirement of unreduction of contracts, " said.
The Unit is held on the basis of the Gusfund Pensions.
As noted by the director of this NPF Oleg Bieloruskie, the unit of funds allows several tasks to be resolved: enlargement of the presentation geography, development resources, reduction of costs, highlighting the best of each fund and optimization of corporate management.
According to his statement, the orientation period for the end of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the NPF "Gasford Pensions" will be the major player on the OPS market.
According to the data on 31 March, the amount of pensions exceeded 373 billion rubs.
As a result of the report on the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner, the KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are currently anatolio Gavrilenko (OOO is 65 per cent) and the NPF Gasfund (35 per cent).
However, only the unit of the group has launched much more late competitors.
Yes, the O1 NPF ' s subcontrol group destroyed the Stallfund still at the beginning of the current year.
Currently, this united NPF provides the Uralcib and the Russian standard funds.
"Association in a single structure, other than reduction of costs, needed to resolve structural tasks," notes the NPF Director "Eventing" Nikolai Sidorov.
Active work on the consolidation of the funds from April, and in the pension group Saphmar - NPF " Ev" and "Occupation and Science" and "Regional Fund" must be affected by the NPF "Saphmar" until the end of the current year.
In 2017, the NPF will be joined to them.
"Association of funds will enhance risk control, operational processes and costs," was noted in the Pension Group of Safmar.
The pause in the unit of the funds held by the "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" may be caused by several reasons, indicating experts.
In recent times, the NPF could not buy more than 40 per cent of the amount of infrastructure in which the group was actively located.
After amendments to the BC in March of this year on a number of emissions corresponding to the regulator's requirements, there are no such arrangements anymore.
If necessary, the whole output can be redeemed by one major player," indicates the ACR financial institutions of Juriy Nogin.
A number of NPF's holders from top-15 on assets for another reason for breaking are called a division of the impact area and, as a consequence, a framework assignment in one fund that the owners of the group had to be acquired.
Anatolio Gavrilenko was not available for comments yesterday.
At the request of "E" in the NPF "Gazfond" were also not answered.
Although the consolidation of the funds is working and unemployment, the decision will be justified at the long distance.
As mentioned by the Consulting Company Director of the Pension Partner Sergey Ocolasnov, the Gusfond Pensional acquisitions are smaller, the adhesion will allow the basis for other funds of the group to stabilize.
In this context, the NPF "KIT Finance" and "Pro-Fond" will have a more successful experience in the building of different OPS sales and the use of more modern PPO.
The requirements of BC for processes and NPF framework will continue, thus duplicating infrastructure on four funds in a single investment policy, considers that the Director for Corporative Assessments " Expert RA" Paul Mitro's.
"The effect of reduction of duplicate functions will cover the costs of unit," notes Mr. Mitro's.
The costs of the four funds of Sergey Ocolasnov are estimated by 30-50 million rubs.
"The rate of four funds of such sizes is about 400 million rubs per year, in consolidation of the medium-term budget to actually reduce the double budget," he assured Mr. Ocolasnow.
The Russian procate was the best design movie "Pet and his dragon".
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the artificial dragon, the mental history and the song in the style of the cantries are enough to believe again in the old-modality, Elena KRAVCUN.
The scared little boy chose a dragon that became a child and a neighbor, and a loving friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, honestly a baby from the book of stories, plays with him in a shot and sleeps in a picture.
Six years after he was grown up and in a rainbound, no longer distinguishing from the other meaningful forest forestry - Mougle.
In such a way, Pita finds the rose-eggery Grace (Briss Dallas Howard), while Gavin's brigade (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively in the forest.
Now she should not only believe in the dragon's ability but also help him to save.
Pete is in the course of being a man in the area of idolic Americans who carry cowboys, moral codes in the heart and laugh more blind than any advertising.
No person looks like or works too terrifying that a viewer actually begins to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who had opened about an untypical resident of his undergoing forests, far to an unfair evildoer.
The big smoking dragon has also been completely invisible, with a good bulldog murder, with a flying wings breaking and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is swimming, murmuring, even crooking, and, for fortunately, doesn't say, but he wants to hunger, and he is well different from all the film-made dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his way to maintain such a high emotional level that at the most stressed moments, they start discouragedly crying in three rounds, not only small stars, but also adults.
Excellently good and little-year Oox Figgy in the role of Pita, which breaks between the possible family and the true friend.
And Robert Redford is virtually issued by a grandfather's canon, who would be pleased to have literally every child.
How did Regisseur David Laurie remove the tastical record of the forgotten Dracon Pita movie in 1977, median from the nose to the end of the wheat and for the mix of an animation and game movie, and make it the most mental movie of this year?
Not how a miracle helped.
In his picture of Laurie from the original, he took only two things: the poor Pete and the dragon.
There were numbers behind the board and most of the strange shots.
This good story reads the graphs set out in "B" and "Inoplane ́in" and many other senders of images.
The Disney study continues to expand the gallery of high-quality ranges in the XXI century.
Of course, "Pet and Dragon" are not so nice as the "Jungly Book", and there is no experienced malician, which about Kate Blanche" is in the role of the cats in the new "Zoulche".
However, this naive movie helps us to believe in miracles and well in the best design traditions.
Moreover, the keys from the magic lock of Disnei Regissor Laurie will be obtained again - for the artificial film adaptation of the history of Peter Pene.
From the "Pite and his dragon" tank, David Laurie and Toby Hallrux scenario entered a new project on a non-adult boy on James Barry's unnamed story.
The journalist RBK Alexander Sokolov reports a new accusation
Lawyers of the journalist RBK Alexander Sokolov, accused of the extremist structure's organization, claimed that the prosecutor had found a non-defenced defence in their defence.
We learned letterly from the investigators that the prosecutor had made such a presentation yesterday.
We have been planned to participate in the judicial meeting on the contact with the matter of voting materials, but it has not yet been done, and the investigators have informed us of the issued prosecutor," says the CRK of Olgy Dinze.
It races that the prosecutors have an incompatible deficiency of the case and collected materials.
The investigators will now need to remove spaces in the proof of the future basis and to make Alexander Sokol's new accusation.
Whether the second article of the Code of the Common Code will appear in fact, or will remain the same, but with other evidence and new evidence, Mrs. Dince.
As reported " E", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June, it was reported that the consequences were excluded from the accusation of the journalist RBK of the formulation of "respecting the political situation in the area of instability" and "confirming the authority on the way".
ALEKSANDR ZILBERT's Correspondent of the Commercentboscosport has ageed a Olympian in the Olympical village, proin's house of Russian collection, eat at the table and even delivered the WADA test after that.
It doesn't seem to live here for a second.
Even night.
The last starts of sometimes are completed in halfnight, after which sports need a half-day hours to return to the Olimpian village.
Furthermore, there is no residence in the village, since some athletes have completed their statements and leave Brazil, and some are only coming here.
Well, at 7:30 in the morning, one of the temporary tents has been reached by the heads of all Olympic delegations.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational living issues - reports the Delegator of the Olympical Team of Russia Igory Kazikov. - Despite the house in which we have been assigned, it is considered an example that it has been used to exploit one of the first and demonstrated all the checkers, even in it there are some deficiencies.
That's with the warm water problem, so I'm sorry, with the unity.
We've been a long time for cleanness.
The dream was just no one came to leave.
Then the clients were coming, but they're just kissing something on the ground, and all.
The fields have, you see, some innovative ones.
Mol, we're moving them.
Let's know these fields are normal.
In general, there have been changes from the clinical company, and now it's OK.
The Olympical village is South Bottovo, the bedroom area on the one side of the mountains, the other, the inflammable river, the salted water.
Well, for confidence, there is still a two-metric railway station that carrys out.
All in the village can be divided up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments in 31 houses.
One of the 18-year-old buildings will have a huge Russian flag -- this house is completely devoted to the need of our collection.
Looking at a small fooy at the entry, it is possible to determine the problems I appear to be the best for the father's team.
On the register station are two statements: the printing "Do not put the paper into the toilet!" and the "Receive in a gift of symbols."
It's the same stopping in the buckets.
Their festival flow contrasts with the titles b'jur: "The memory of infections for those going to Rio de Janeiro", "The first aid in the epoch, the fall of the internal body in the breath, the loss of awareness is this heart-leaving reanimation," "The first help in fires, heat attacks, breathes and blood".
The text inside is increasingly hopeful.
For example, "Infection is subject to a disorder and follow-treatment.
However, not everyone is a pleasant result.
Of course, Russia ' s collection has medium, which at any time will be prepared to provide a qualified assistance to the residents of the house, including a deploying and positive massage.
Instead of medium is our own delegation's staff.
The gate with the door is a inspiring cry, "Although nothing, we will win."
Well, and, of course, the verses:
All arguments are absolutely crazy!
They believe only those who fear.
Let us be less than we're, that sweet bathroom, that Russia's not going away, that's not breaking!
And for a greater brethren, it will be declared: "Brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all Russian Cyril, the spiritual seed on the sportsmen of the Olympian Russian assembly about Andrew Vladimirovich Alexander.
A request and other requests can be ordered by the phone...
In fact, the Centre of Meditating and Religious Departments for representatives of all conferences is located in the village territory.
Well, the Russian, it seems, in a privileged position -- they have their own hour.
With regard to the threat of the lift from the nineth stage at the fourth, I decided to go down by the steps that are recommended and used during the fire.
And in the darkness spa was about the bodies on it.
In view of all, they were the sleeping partners of the new clinical company.
I guess they were willing at any time to go on the innovation sex to make them a quiet hour directly on cold steps.
At the fourth stage, I was waiting for a meeting with an ancient known Vitalia Fedorovic Dubko, a trainer of our batuists who brought them to Olympian gold 16 years ago in Sidney.
He with the educational campaign, John Paul’s, was kindly agreed to show his camels.
Sorry about a great account of nothing, the Russian trainer is divided by the impressions. - We live two, the beds are, of course, almost appeal, but it's not critical.
Sanusel one on four, but it's so space.
Scaff, of course, is funny, of the tissue, doesn't cause confidence, but things can be placed.
"No, you're kidding, the tea has been finished!" divorced with the hands of the tennisist Sightlan Kuznez's meet at the main table.
It is called at least because it is a space of 2.7 thousand quarters and is ready to accept at the same time five thousand visitors.
There are 60 thousand pounds on the top in the summer, totally free.
Menu options: "The Best of Brazil", "The Cookies of the World", "Asiatic Foods" and "Pizzas, Macaron products".
The last option, I've seen, is a large popularity of our volunteers.
In this way, we say, I didn't find any supper in any of the giant restaurants.
What are they?
Well, I'm glad I've got a Chinese, an insult.
And a tea.
But so that you can understand, we have food on the cards yet worse.
There's something you can choose here, despite the unity.
I personally picked up a couple and a cocktail in the tomat suit.
A table with its name is available in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as in the indication of the food value of the product and the advantage of allergenes.
Well, all right, to admit, it was the same thing.
I don't even understand why this kind of thing is worth in McDonald's.
Those who are disappointed can say "the small" sportsmans at the outcome of the restaurant wait for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Independent Agency (WADA).
The victoriane winner has a football.
They're provocating, you can say!
To get a gift, at least eight questions from ten must be answered correctly.
There are questions on Russian! The girl of WADA attacked me.
But it wasn't an attack.
So I've been in the patriote's rupture, naturally.
The situation was already addressed on the second question, "If I received an information about the transition of the doping control, should I immediately go to the point of control?"
I stopped on the W option, "No, I've got one hour."
I lost, so I said, wake up.
I forgot that the WADA wasn't going to wait.
In general, I have to do it immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage of the victory, my situation became critical.
I thought sometimes that if I would be difficult to observe the balanced diet because of my body graph (and I, in fact, hard!), I could use bioaddictions to get "added" in order to increase my productivity.
No, they're not allowed!
The answer is more accurately formulated that the category is not prohibited, but insistently in several proposals.
It's not honestly playing this WADA!
So how's it, Russia?
Let's go somewhere behind Ethiopia, Isinbai and all our defensive team.
That's why I focused on and I wined a bad football from the last forces.
You know what he says, ours!
In a victory, I took the fitness in the neighborhood.
I'm getting out of the count of the trainers.
I've got 250.
He was surprised that there was no Russian sportsman found in this threat.
But maybe it's right?
Let him who doesn't know to play!
And there's one of our guys sitting in a dish near the polyline.
In order to the ocult.
Don't worry, don't shooter.
In the polyline, however, as in the whole village, wherever it is, it's the equipment for the delivery of preservates.
It has been drawn up with an appealing calling: "Bring the condom!"
The iron that reminds the door lock and the preservates produced from the natural latex of Amazon is ready to go out of the device.
I took myself alone for memory.
It won't be surprised by the sportsmans -- they were carrying 450 thousand.
As once for the celebration and celebration of the Olympian village, there is a whole entertainment center.
This is a known table that reminds the International Olympic Committee of Sports to treat 3.25 million dollars daily.
Video games, biljard and tennis tables, football and hoke and some strange devices similar to video trainers.
What is this? - I'm interested in a companion in the form of a Ukrainian collection, which actively uses a wildleague.
Of course, I could just say he doesn't want to talk to a person in the form of Russia's collection, and all.
Here, in some strange events in the eyes, the guys get out of yellow blue.
The most playing collection is shown.
To go throughout the village, looking at each angle, we need at least three hours.
But if you are just walking and not driving on electrocars, you will also be opened to the house of a Canadian assembly with the entrance and a tent with a rebuilding bathroom, and the ticket, and the chemical, and the parkmaker, and the color store, and the cotton with the goods of all night consumption, and close to the unique marks (you can't even overcome the row from the Chinese filthysts), and the bank, and the office of findings, and the kiosk.
And lately at night, you're sitting near the olive tree with a different colorful boat in memory of the world of friends and families of the athletes.
And you'll be under the car accompany, which is increasingly raising the weight of the insects to die, think of everlasting.
That's about the Olympical Motion.
Whatever in this village doesn't end for a minute.
As long as the rest of the Russian world was awakening the breath, the Australians almost had been baptized by the American Dream Team, real sick people went to the network.
Little people know, the news that Inna Deriglasov won gold in the rapper on the XXXI Olympics games, I got the first.
Maybe I'm even the only mosquito who saw this happening -- without thinking of those who looked at the conferences in Carioca that night.
This can only understand the real sister.
Here's Moscow stupid night.
Neighbors below -- as always at night -- are wake up and starting abroad, but it is very sound to cry on each other.
And threatening to move a mobile.
The kitchen runs the crane is not time to go to the market and buy as a new man asked.
There is nothing to understand in the television schedule, so he just kept the "Match", "The First" channel control and the "Russian" case -- even though it's almost insignificant.
"Russian" is a family repeated, the whole sport there's why in records.
There's a serial in the direct epher.
Hope, of course, for "Motch" -- a young man's whole evening cried out in new events of dream -- about the big half-final of Deriglasov--Shanaev, then about the coming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead of this basketball, the United States, Australia.
I can't say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were on the winners, the first half of them.
It was placed on the office of the Americans' own office.
Consequently, they were lost, but, as they are now expressed, the basketball olympical tournament will be no longer old.
It's all right, but it's close to the fight with De France and on the screen without changing.
I'm starting to write channels in a easy panic.
That feeling, the second time they're getting stuck.
Okay, let's go to the deep, to the cab.
There's no of the thematic "Mothers".
And, according to my feelings, the battle will begin.
Text and Twitter translation of some sites are not supported by me.
The Court of Justice gives an unexpected but flashing result.
On the first site, it is evident that the preliminary technical translation of all the conversions that are currently running.
I'm clicking on the featuring, I'm getting a soldier for gold.
Deriglas is a good contract, he goes forward, and clearly begins to take time.
The Italian plays almost all the fractions.
Our one point forward, to the end, at least two seconds.
De Francisco is gone to Deriglaz, and it turns away, and the time ends, and the Italian carries a cow.
Victory!
A few seconds, the Olympian mediator on the phone reports about the fourth golden medal.
Looks like I'm the first one who saw it with my eyes.
The foolish, the faithful, the associated.
The spirit management of the Muslim (DOM) Tatarstan refuses to use Russian languages in shoes.
Yesterday, the DUM captives had committed their maturity to preach Friday only on the tatary to make young tatars "from their own tongue".
The Government states that it "not in any case harms" the right of the Muslim of other nationalities.
In some sorrows, Kazani states that tatar language does not understand up to 60 per cent, including foreign students, migrants and tatars themselves.
We are afraid that their tataric preachers will not come to the whole audience.
Ireland the DUM Tatarstan captives agreed to take a decision on Friday preachers in the reprieves only in the Tatar language.
As Tatarstan Camille Samigullin said, this must be an incentive for young tatars to "suffer their own tongue".
"For those who say "heavy" we are going to organize tatary lessons absolutely free," Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today in all the swords of the preaching " must already be in the tatary language".
He said that DOM Tatarstan was publishing the magazine "Shura" with typical preachers in Tatar.
I have, who doesn't say well tatarically, "they can be prepared basically."
DUM Tatarstan units more than thousands of income in all the munitions of rep.
According to the mufty, Friday preachers are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in a number of shoes, the Russian language was primarily used in Kazani.
In particular, as showed by the muffins, this was about in the Burnai's Mount, Zacabana and Eniller.
However, Mr. Muhametchin emphasized that the leadership is the task of all students to possess both public languages of rep, independent of nationality.
"Not the suspicion of the Muslim-Netatar can't be any thing," Mr. Muhametchin emphasized, explaining that the preaching itself "is not a commitment, the main part of the wedding."
In the same way, the assembly will continue to be read in Arabic, and the lessons and lessons in Russia will be maintained in the songs.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametchin said, "E," that there was no serious threat to tatary exhausts from shoes.
Furthermore, other Russian and Tatarian languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are not used in reply preachers.
The DOM resolution was actively supported in the Executive Committee of the World Congress Tatar (WTO).
The Chapter of the CTR Rinat Zakirov said "E": "Mets are an important part of our national life."
It would be cruel if the Tatar language had gone out of this field.
He noted that the conduct of preaching only in the tatary "the desire of the own own" but in the WCT "require it as true".
The requested "E" have, which states the Russian preachers, are ready to comply with the DOM decision, but they believe that there will be difficulties with the understanding of the sacred servants.
The tatars and the Russians are walking in the dream.
Many don't understand the language.
They, of course, will be sad.
"I've got to retreat," says I have the Burnai's Pharhat Mavletdin's whisper.
According to his words, Russian preachers are closer to many tatars, since "Russian and in schools, and in sads, the radio is originally everywhere."
However, he believes that the smoke will continue lessons and lessons in the Russian language that are conducted in other days.
We trust in Allah.
Allah will show the outcome of this situation." He concluded.
But about 60% of us don't know the Tatar language.
It's both Uzbeki, and Tajiki, and Azerbaijans.
We have many foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"This is why we are four years as we passed to Russian," says I.
He believes that the preaching in the Tatar language will "come to a higher circle and not to the whole audience".
But we'll be subject to the decision of the captive.
Only the outcome of the preaching will be different.
But it'll show time.
"I, for example, will only be more, because the Tatar language is my family," said Gabdulla Galilee.

Snapchat 'Anime' effect criticizes as asiatic carcatature
Snapchat states that this filter is inspired by an animation, but some observers say that it is racially unaccurate.
With the Linza tool, Snapchat allows approximately 150 million users to change the reality and play individually in ways that limit absurdity.
You can turn yourself into ananas, dogs or persons to make the picture of Roy Liechtenstein.
The lines are a bullshit, which makes more than 30 million corrected lands daily.
Any mistakes become soon general.
The Snapchat lines were criticized in the past when they were accused that the application of the advertising was a dark skin or encouraged the white as a ideal beauty.
So when some users offered a linz this week, which offered their hair eyes, teeth and fucking bottles, some critics believed that it was a racist carcatature for the Asiates, "jealths".
And they asked whether these repeated contradictions were indicated to the more serious problem of the company with diversity.
In the middle of the reports, the reporting on The Verge and Motherboard was distributed on the day after Snapchat said that they had removed this function.
Company Procommended: Linza was designed as an animation person rather than as an asiatic carcatature.
But the experts who know about racism have not heard the line of the stereo in the .
Others totally rejected the comparison with an animation.
In the electronic letter, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student of experiences whose Twitters were actively shared, said that the linz was "of the killing and at least injury".
She added that "was hard to compare the side of a very deep carcatature on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just a geal, but a higher devastating.
Snapchat is not the only company that goes through these cultural mosters.
American culture in an infinite fight for multidimensionality and inclusiveness, starting from corporate meetings to Hollywood and girls we all have.
And a huge audience of young people in Snapchat - which are racially different than their older generation - may mean that they are more likely to understand.
When one of the Snapchat lines creates an image of the user's mortal, then, in an interview on Tuesday 25-year-old Cathy Ju, "that's the way of events is much more difficult to stay unnoticed as it was before."
On Thursday Jue, the product manager and engineer working on Medium decided to remove its accounting in Snapchat and invited others to do the same.
In the article for Medium and on the phone interview, she said that racial contrasts are the cause of a lack of diversity in Snepchate.
Jue criticized the primarily white leadership of the company consisting only of men and finished its article by the host: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Jue, who is the American Chinese origin, wrote: "They have not enough white people in the state who could take such decisions or who have small white people, but they do not take the jobs to which they can be safe and openly expressed."
Other observers divide her view, expressing disappointment by the fact that Snapchat did not answer the majority of her questions.
The company does not provide information on the presentation of national minorities in its country, underlineing the status of the private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but, according to the confidential, the company had recently taken a recycler to focus on the insufficient levels of the population and active attempts to maintain internal resources.
From her side Jue said she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding, "I'm interested if they really need more users like us to say that they don't eat."
The military leader has decreased the information about IGIL, reports the Committee of the Assembly
The U.S. Centre of Armed Powers have changed reports to make a more optimistic picture of war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than to give the events on the matter, reported by the Committee on the Assembly in the report issued on Thursday.
The Interim Report of the Operative Group established by the Chairmans of the Committee of the Committee on the Affairs of the Council, the Committee on Inquiry and the Subcommittee for Military Assets found " a wide range of disabilities" among the analysis of the Centre Commanding Service, which claimed that the Rulers had submitted their American Affairs to win over the Islamic State.
The central command, as Centcom, is the main military administration in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The reporting documents approved by the higher command of Centcom, usually, gave a more optimistic picture of the U.S. anti-Terrorists than confirmed real data from events and were more optimistic than the analysis provided by other speech services," stated the report.
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the higher guide is an uncertain analysis, our wars suffer," said the member of the Palace of the representatives of Ken Calvert, a repliant from California.
The problem with the leading in Centcom has reached the most of the organization.
The detailed detailed report includes the deficiencies of the United States in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of the United States for the training of Iraq ' s armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain evidence of the fact that the members of the Administration of Obama have ordered to fascinate reports, he claims that the analystes have felt that the leadership of Centcom was forced to present them a more optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, as well as IHIL or ISIL.
"In the first half of 2015, many press reliefs, statements and witnesses of the Central Command in the Congress were significantly more optimistic than real events," reported the report.
For example, the leader of Centcom publicly stated that the major military attack on the return of Mosul could be started in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second of the city of Iraq, remains under control of the Islamic State.
"After the months of the investigation, this is probably aware," said a member of the Palace of representatives Mike Pompeo, a rep. from Kansas.
Since 2014 to the middle of 2015, the highest guideline of the United States Centre Department of Intelligence was undertaken in order to reduce the threat from IHI in Iraq.
The replies were created by a operational group when they realized that the analystes expressed anxiety that the island State informed was false.
As the investigation continues, the report on Thursday follows more broadly.
Additional and unfinished investigation of Centcom is conducted by the Major In-In-Officer of the Defence Minister.
The representatives of the Democratic Party in the Committee on the Inquiry of the Council of the United States Congress Representatives on Thursday, with some of the conclusions of the Republic of the Operative Group.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom has established a excessively closed production procedure for IHIL and Iraq's protection army," states the member of the Council of the representatives of Adam B. Shiff, the main representative of the democracy party in the Committee.
This procedure, according to Shiff, "depreciated the issue of information documents", caused a damage to the moral status of analyticals and "not enough reflects disruptive views".
But Shiff and the democrats claim that they have not found evidence that the White House has tried to force Centcom's analyticals to submit their conclusions under "determined or political interpretation".
Predict the results of the Congress investigation were presented on Tuesday the Daily Beast portal.
Last August, the New York Times reported the investigation of Pentagon's main intactors opened after the Centcom's analysis claim.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of Pentagon, said in the statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the account of the assembly until the main inquiry was continued.
But he said that "experts are sometimes in view of the processing of complex data, and special services and the Defence Minister welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues of national security."
The consequences of the investigation are based on the question of whether the aims of bombing in Iraq and Syria are achieved by the Americans (as currently states more than the representatives of the Defence Minister).
However, the previous year of statements make sure that President Obama may be convinced that the Central Command provides true military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of the Islamic State repeated the disputes that occurred more than ten years ago when the Centcom Gregory Hucker's audience analysis wrote an investigation in the article in which it was asserted that president George Wooker Bush was aware of the protest of many analystes in support of a small number of army in Iraq and did not think that it would be followed in 2003.
Huker also played a key role in the protest of the Islamic State.
Last year, according to the officers, Huker's team concluded that despite public statements on return, aircrafts on oil trafficking belonging to the Islamic State have not led to a significant damage to the financial position of the grouping terrorists because it has built temporary oil transfers to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not distributed to the parts of the Central Command, as reported in September the Times newspaper.
The commander Centcom, General Lloyd J. Osten III, criticized last year after witnessing in Senate, which many deputats had considered too optimistic war assessment.
General Ostin was released in April and replaced by the Central Command of Gen. Joseph L.Wotel.
The United States wins four times a female hoke on grass, so close to the solution with Britain
With the killing of three nails in the gate that had been won over Japan with account 6-1, Cathy B opened the account on Thursday with the first two footballs for the United States female hocking team on the grass when the Americans were won by the Indian team with 3-0.
Five in two games must be a reminder, but B, whose 27 years of age, states that she would never have done something like it.
"I don't know," she said.
Actually, I'm not of those who follow their necks.
This is what she knows: The 4-0 Americans in the Olympian tournament, and they are going to be the first place in their group with Britain, which remains inconvenible after Japan's expiry, with 2-0 on Thursday.
British and United States teams will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first tour.
Both teams claim to the quarter end, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams and who is the second.
The winner will avoid meetings with a strong team of opponents from Netherlands, leaders of another group, a little time when games of quarterfinal are started.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans here did a sound of their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among 12 teams in London games.
B was in that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Penn's state, and first took a shock for chocking on the grass when she was 3 (the older sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national collection at the age of 16, became her youngest player in the history.
It lost Olimpiade 2008 when it did not pass the election tour to the final composition.
Then it was 2012 when it and her team partner did not work.
In the next year, Koyg Parnch, an English, was appointed as a trainer, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, physician training change," said B.
We have not had the productivity that is now in London.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, B opened the account in the first half of the game with an inappropriate hand on a short distance.
India came to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team was surprised to be surprised and maintained the count of 1 to 0 until the end of the third period when B had taken the initiative in its hands.
She made a long walk with a bottle down to the left side of the field, then the sprays entered the middle and swiftly sent the ball into the gate, so it gave the Americans the benefit of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzáles added a final nucleus in the middle of the fourth period.
The victory of "success" was the first on the tournament for the U.S. door Jackie Briggs, who passed on one neck in each of the first three victories.
She's hit.
Like B.
"We are in good position right now," parnch said, but how good it depends on the result of the Sabbath game.
In the middle of the Olympical Games - "days" of the bathroom
Wherever you are, whatever time it is now, it's Olympias.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be incredible and inevitable, which is an enormous combination of employment and effort.
It's the olympical fire itself, and there's the burning box that is transferred from the bullet to the rubber, to the gymnast, to the triatlonist.
You can't activate television, read the newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the coffee and not hear about Simon Bailes, Cathy Ledeki or the enemy between Michael Felps and Chaddam de Clo.
And there's Logan Douley.
Duli, who was first involved in the Olympics games, a beauty boxer, could be in full among the popularities that were held in the time of sponsors and living-approving reklame roles if he was a plant, a gimnast, or even a physician.
But the 28-year-old Duli from Lake Forest in California fights for gold in the olympics on the bathroom.
The Olympical Fire doesn't light all the events equally.
Further than the center, partly in shadow, are those species that I do not have the general recognition: the shooting of the fifth gun, the shooting of the bullet, the badminton, the haqwando.
Brass will always be with us, his long rulership.
But if I have been allowed to say to protect my personal attractiveness, let me take your attention to the humility of the bathroom.
Although the bathroom I've been the Olympian species since 2000 when they've been playing on games in Sidney, in the past 16 years they've been so lowly recognizing that many of my requested people were not in the sense that they have been related to the Olympian species.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States and sent sportsmen to conferences, they have never won meals in bathroom bathroom, and they are not finally at the end of 2012.
Chinese and Russian, usually, share men's rewards, and Chinese and Canadians are female.
Dun Dun from China and Rose will protect their London gold medals this year.
But the bathroom is a layer of an authside, especially because they are more associated with the cycle college than with the Olympian games.
Here I have to admit that I'm not a expert but a natural enthusiast.
They really have a comic potential, it is a carcataural meal of infinite beefs, but also the exhaustity of hymnistics and birds in water, two species of which they are mainly related to themselves.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolin", which means "trampline for water-shirts".
The winners are on a giant bathroom that is running in the air at nearly 30 feet, and they must carry out a series of acrobatic tricks (revers, swimming and salt) to the end of the landing.
They are evaluated on the implementation, complexity and "flight time" of the Official Programme of the Olympics Games.
Thirty-two sports from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will be gathered to Rio.
The most distributed olympical course is forward.
The candidates to the medal must go further, quickly, up and upward after gold, sometimes to finish, and sometimes up and forward, in the field.
They strive not only to the finish or starting wall, but also, in the form of a television camera, to another crushing roof: a world or olympical record.
This is a deep desire, worthwhile, even fanatic, and it is enough to make even a looker cross.
But I think this is the same thing that makes a few losses in the Game view.
It's the bathroom's shoes.
The batutis is upward.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she shoots, an unknown, as astronaut, flys up, then down, then no effort again to top.
Of course, they do not have competition or work, but throughout the whole programme there is no stupid concern for finishing, no debt in length, only a wonderful, impressive delay of time and gravity.
It's the most close to the day of the olympical species.
Women ' s conferences and then the end will pass on Friday, translation on the day at the east time; men are on the Sabbath, too in the hour.
NBC will translate the final in the agenda from 14:00 a.m. on both day.
It is expected a quiet, easily looking at the overall floor to the olympics.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by undertaking sports-man's views and objectivity -- as the Wall Street Journal recently proposed by men of the United States, Duli just waits for his new excited tower of fans.
The "Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, the former United States Union
Straight protests in Ethiopia
Demostrates who require political changes in Ethiopia faced a cruel opposite from the Government.
Clears say that tens of protestants were deadly hurt during the meetings with sex.
Is Ethiopia actually on the border of the race?
In the past decades, it was one of the most stable countries, a strong West Union with quickly developing economy.
However, in the past months, anti-governmental protests on the country spread to a larger number of its territory.
Only in the last week, thousands of people went out to the street, requireing radical political changes.
According to human rights protectors, the government ' s reaction was cruel.
The evidence claimed that the police officers had shot tens of free demons.
Video records with protests proposed at the end of the past or at the beginning of this year are like the security officers killing young people with the hands of their hands to the wall.
The highest official of the United Nations on Human Rights now calls for a careful investigation.
"It was always difficult to maintain this country from disappointment, and it will be more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Rog project in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second guest population country after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the Western.
American military and discernment services are closely cooperating with Ethiopies to face terrorism threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and almost no country in the West is supported.
Ethiopia's economy is developed at a impressive speed.
Her infrastructure has been significantly improved — even a new holiday road in Addis Abebe's capital.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia has been an example of democracy — human rights organizations have always mentioned government repressions - the opposition of the State has been cut off because the dissidents have actually made silence.
Many of them were sent, arrested, killed or cast into remote wilderness.
But that can change.
"If people continue to press and have no other options other than protesting, the resurrect will be raised," said Seum Tessome, the Lector of the University in Central Ethiopia.
All the youth will protest.
The generation will protest.
The complaints are numerous, starting from earthquake, by ending the government's coalition.
After widely critical elections last year, the Governing Party and its associates have completely distorted the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, the pressure towards the border with Eritrea will be held; the fight for this undetermined border has brought hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics are afraid that separatist groups that have been more or less in the past years, such as the Oromo Freedom Front or the Ohaden National Freedom Front, may try to use and overcome.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, a few years of depth of soul, are now breathing.
The first seems to be absolutely unnecessary: smartphones.
Only in the past few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate in networks, since raw smartphones have become eating, and the Internet service has become better.
Even when the Government closes access to Facebook and Twitter as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through the servers that hide where they are.
A few young Ethiopians said that they were organized for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Ormo and Amhar, two major ethnic groups of Ethiopia.
Oromo and Amhar are not natural aliens.
During the centuries of Amhar from the primaryly Christian high mountain areas of Ethiopia, the political and bishop of Oromo was developed, many of whom I was being Muslims and would be in low areas.
But it also changes.
"We will set a community at the same beginning," said Mulatu Gemech, leader Orome.
The major protests passed in the areas of Amhara and Ormo.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that the members of the Tigray Group are unjustly dominated in Ethiopia, which consists of approximately 6 per cent of the population and controls the military, trade, and policy.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, an ex-revolution leader, was responsible by the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until he died from the disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical gene, a person who could predict the danger.
Analysis claims that he was especially experienced in recognition of the first signs of deficiency and spent the indicators in order to obtain data and depreciation of opponents.
"The current regime does not have a healthy sense," said Abdi, an analysis of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalen, appeared nowhere and took place in Melesa.
Despite Meles, who was born from the region of Tigrai in North Ethiopia, Heilemariam is the South.
Analysers say that he does not use confidence in the security services controlled by Tigras.
Many are afraid that this would lead to further blood proliferation.
The last time, Ethiopia had survived such anxieties in 2005, after thousands of people protested against that, as an analysis said, it seems to have been the choices that the Government had committed and then made the results.
Many protestants have been killed in the course of sequences, although in less than in the past months, and this period of disappointment has passed quickly.
Experts on Development expressed appreciation for Ethiopia ' s long-term development of infrastructure, such as a new cross-border train and a success in combating poverty.
But it is obvious that it has not stopped the growth of the internal deficiency by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesting in Gondor, the city in Amhara, the attacks of Tigrai, and the anti-Tigrai hatred in the current networks becomes a comprehensive.
Analysis claims that the protestants of the United States and other Western Unions are unfair.
The American Government spent Ethiopia as a base for non-pilot flights over the neighbors of Somalia, although it recently declared that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the west wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, he does not want his alien to lose force in an instabil region.
"And this will be difficult to pass on the channel," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that IHIL was Obama, "Sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to replace the last conflict covered by his pre-elected staff on Friday, claiming that he had shot when several times this week he claimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "based" terrorists of the Islamic State's grouping.
The interpretation led to new issues of the candidate's ability to post the president from the Republic of the Republic to address the American people.
It also placed his substitutes who were trying to protect him during anxiety period, as they had to explain the statements he probably did not mean.
Through this suggestion on midnight, Trump determined to stand on his existence on Thursday, repeating in the interview that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton were based on IHIL.
But in the post in the Twi'er early morning, Trump wrote that he was just kidding.
This post was a direct opposite to the fact that it had been done the day before the Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his accusation.
When the radio-conservative Hugh Hwitt tried to help Trompe helping him to say that Obama wanted to have IHIL, the Chairman's post candidate from the Republic of the Party did not have a chance.
The last scandal was disappointed when Tromp tried to reorient his campaign to the economy at the background of the reduction of the rating.
Thrump and Clinton have spoken with competitors on the economy in Michigan this week.
Thrump tried to return to this subject on Friday.
When he returned to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would increase taxes and claimed that it had been deceived.
Thrump has already exposed the sarcasm as a correction.
At the end of July, after he had taken a global critical, he almost expressed the idea that the Russian should break the e-mail of Clinton, he later explained his comments, saying, "End, I'm crazy."
Such approach allows the Trump to go out of the political issues and to take his words back, if necessary.
"I think that it's his way to test those or other messages that have a response among his worshippers, to see how they are, and then to "explain" them to the one or other side, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communicative expert who conducted an analysis of the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is careful in his statements and knows that they are sufficiently disappointed to treat them differently.
Instead of mixing statements for a wide elector, Trump took a more vulnerable tone in the last days while its calculation continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist reported on Friday showed that the Trump is taking Clinton with a large transport in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorada and coming with it to Florida.
Although Trump usually trys not to apologize for provokational things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and deceiting his feelings of humor.
However, since the Trump is an object of higher attention in the last months of the presidential campaign, its shoes have placed his faithful aliens in an injurious situation: they have to support it publicly, whatever provocation it has said.
Rudolph W. Juliani, former Mr. New York, who was one of the most abilities of Trompa, made serious efforts to protect the candidate in the interview given by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," said Julian when he was asked about Trump's authenticity that Obama and Clinton were based on the Islamic State.
It is true that before Obama, IHIL was almost a small organization, he called it a no threat, absolutely injust, and this is why it happened because he brought an army out of Iraq.
The majority of the medium-statistic replies assures that the Obama administration, in which the Clinton posted by the State Secretary, allowed IHIL to develop, because I am not able to put the situation in the Middle East.
Thrump continued to attack the media of mass information in Pen-Bani on Friday for the discussion of each of its words and preferences to it.
He was over the "poor unfortunate" television experts trying to talk to him, and he said, "They are!"
Democracy had laughed in the Trumpe's accusations as far as it did not take advantage of the presidents.
Sometimes the coffee is returning to Greenpoint
Verb's coffee was a coffee that only takes available place in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but was given a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was removed from her home with a vitrine at Bedford Aven.
The Super Sheri magazine, who took the "Verb" place in 2014, is being sold in the form of cakes.
The local people paid it as the last loss in the renewal city.
Master Molly Krabaple wrote in your owner, "New York is always changing, I know, but I can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chalsie's hotel is disrupted and Verb is now a mixture."
But although New York is always changed, it is, in turn, updated.
Verb's birth coffee opened in November last year in Greenpoint less than in the mile north from the original place.
The new Verbe contains Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but there are some of the same and similar simple atmosphere.
Moreover, coffee is still good.
In the new Verba chapter, Sisko Rodriguez, an older man of coffee, who is owner and manager of the news.
He started working in Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the customers proposed to provide it on a new term, he said he would be glad to do it.
Rodriguez, who was 36 years old, left many in the past.
"Verb" works with the same bague distributor and buys the same coffee machine model.
It has even a bullet of the old Verba in it.
But Rodriguez said he would also want to experiment.
He offered new foods.
The menu contains sandwiches with bacon, egg and sire, and are in the form of toping of coppers or frozen bowls.
There's a fucking rice food.
There's no bird anymore in the coffee, but now it's prepared for fresh socks.
For nine months, Rodriguez said that he was focused on the inchanging flow of old continuous customers.
"Multium of the clients would also pay prices from Williamsberg," he shared.
One of the recent resurrections of Rebecca Olivier was one of these clients.
Oliveira, who was 34 years old, lived before in Williamsberg and often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still traveled there.
After "Verba" closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that the coffee and the atmosphere imponed me in Verbe," she said.
Now she's drinking a coffee again, although it's the place of a normal coffee for a buyed tea that day, another news.
Tom Rosental, another older client, has visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He went in front of the man and commanded the same.
"In fifteen minutes of eight, every day, as for hours, I came, and for me my battle was prepared with oil and in all ways," he said.
Rodriguez reported that he wanted to experiment and introduced new foods into the menu.
Today, Rosental makes a ordinary order, but once he changes something with a bacon, egg or oil on a bath with all ways.
Rodriguez said he wasn't injured with that the magazine had ever overcome an old place.
Moreover, the Super Sheri owners proposed to prepare a wheat for Verba using coffee prepared by cold way as an engineer.
"I think we may agree on their proposal," said Rodriguez.
Permanent inhabitants of Greenpoint of Poland also coffee.
One of these new customers translated the menus to the Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the vitrine so that his new neighbors would feel likely.
There are other benefits in the new place.
The local point for sale of sugar planning to divide on bottles and sell coffee prepared by cold way.
There is a possibility that coffee will come to her neighbourhood.
For many customers, it is enough that the new Verb will include their favorite foods in the menu.
Joseph White was a continuous client, and he shared that he was killed by a fire when they were closed.
When the coffee was opened on the new condition, Whit said that when he entered and commanded a coffee, he felt like he returned home.
"How long I wanted to feel this aroma," he admitted.
Depressive depression food in "Plotboard"
In March 1933, after the president's post, Franklin Delano Roswellt was sitting in the Oliver Office.
As a gourman, President Ruswell loved the modal feeds of the Fifth Avenue, such as fua-gra and Meriland's soap.
His menu on this day was more modesty: fashioned eggs in the tomat soose, cartography powder and dessert pudding.
"This was the act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," Jane Zigelman said.
Her husband Andrew Cow added, "This was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The wives living in B'lin-Hights are specialists in the history of food.
After the book of Koa, Ragu po-Chinetic, it was dedicated to the Chinese kitchen in America, and Zigelman race history of life in a deep apartment in the Lower East Side through food in his book "Home 97 on the F’s Garden".
Their new joint work "Plotna table", which will be repeated by Harper, on Tuesday, is a story of American food in the Great Depression.
In some degree of their own culinary solidarity, they met the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a little swimming wedding in the Flatayron Station, working since 1929, in the Birge Wood.
Zigelman, 54, took Indian, cartography, and fruit mixture for the oil.
When the reporter commanded a meat role, the couple considered that it was a suitable sending point for the discussion on food during the Depression.
"The rulets used a big question," Zigelman said.
There was an arachis' roulette, a wednesday roulette, a boob roulette.
They were made from the main ingredient and dessert products that allowed ingredient to be used.
Imagine that you eat so much arachis as you need for dinner.
Cow's moved.
"It was probably in a stone of stones," he said.
In the years before Depression, the American table, especially in agriculture, represented the Swedish table.
Women's groups were prepared for farmers, and the fresh pig was prepared for breakfast, dinner and dinner.
The Americans have sent food to hungry peers during the First World War. The "Plotboard" describes how the country was determined to stop being a country of resources.
"This was the time when the food became a central, indispensable topic for the Americans," Cou said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Similarly, it was a new budgetary ratio: mysterious foods, such as rolls and packagings, have become the main food products; the packaging is a "beautiful way to furniture," said Zigelman, ' because the air could hide anapetical ingredients under the low of sous.
Fresh f^tes were replaced by more swimming suhof.
Meat, which was the former foundation of the American food for many years, has become an economically division.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and food values have become more important than cushion and even culinary health.
By studying the book, including the recipients, Zigelman prepared the food of the time: the cup of the bullet, which is fashioned with arachistic oil.
"This addition to the covered table was not successful," Cou said.
Zigelman added, "It was very strange."
Arachis oil is not perfectly suitable to the feeding bow.
This was characteristic for many household recipes.
As never before and never since, household specialists — including Louise Stanley, the Federal Office’s Chef of the Office — have managed food habits from 1923 to 1943.
With the receptions and articles in the newspapers and magazines, they advise women to become "budgetary holders" to accept and convert a bullshit as a married spaghetti into feeding.
The "Plotboard" is a piece of interesting historical facts.
Especially picant stories about the reaction of the Government to hungry citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Guvern in the spirit of "new pigs" are eating.
It was publicly transported a single farmer staff of the Iowa state in its time, and he was eating as a deceased millioner of them.
"He liked the continental kitchen, for example, the egg-sused fish," Koe said.
He ate almost in the golden table, hopeing to smoking.
He was tastically rejected from reality.
President Ruswell could make the same mistake if his wife did not advise him to give an example to her own jealousy.
As stated in the book, Eleanor Roswellt had an economy that was not totally interested in the cuss, and that led to that "the White House used not only the most unusual food in Washington but sometimes and the most disgustingly prepared".
Many of the culinary receipts of Depression were forgotten as soon as the country arose again.
Their inheritance is our continuous focus on calories and food, says Zigelman, and how science was used to prepare food.
The wives tell that when they wrote the book, they better understanded the food habits of the mother Zigelman — she couldn’t eat, for example.
"He was seriously scared of an impediment of food," Cow said.
Zigelman recalls, "It's been a whole series of people."
There was a bad case with profiles.
When the stars in Eisenberg's were devastated, they and Coo got a dessert that prepared home: a dessert from the black cow that President Ruswell eat for dinner.
"This is called a black mush," Zigelman added that it was a distributed receipt - to give modesty recepts a brochure names.
There were no slaughtered sheep, only black, a little swimming, sugar, water, and corn.
Everyone with her was driving a bed into a white, nice, nice art.
A surprise, it was nice.
Cow asked adds twice.
By the voice of a certain budgetary establisher, he said to the wife, "There would not be a hinderer of a few broken Greek orchards."
The arrest of the figures of the case on the mass drake on the Housing Board was extended until 14 November
The Pressence Court left the case of mass dragon cases in the Hawaiian staff until 14 November, satisfying the appropriate follow-up.
The case is 14 persons who are accused of being accused.

Gilead companies will pay costs for services during the hepatitis C with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to get the expenditure to the services it has made in relation to the difficulty of hepatitis patients with the manufacturer of medical medicines Merck & Co Inc, has established a Federal Circle Court.
In June, the Gilead company was released from the payment of $200 million for the infringement of two Merck patents related to the drugs of Gilead, Swaldi and Harvoni, after the American judge found a number of violations from Merck, including the lie under the swearing and other non-ethical acts.
At the court on Thursday, the court of the United States Federal Court, Beth Labson Friman said that the Gilead company had the right to refund the costs of the demand.
Merck's company is trying to get Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of drugs from hepatitis C, which can treat more than 90 percent of patients with feeding.
It was in 2013 when Gilead and Merck were sent to the court of each other by declared their rights to the laboratory based on the sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead medicines.

Clinton for $10.75 million in 2015 and payed 34.2 per cent of the federal tax
Hillary Clinton announced its tax declarations for 2015, which showed that the Presidents of the Democracy Party and her husband had 10,75 million income dollars in this year and paid an effective federal rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in favourable contributions, mainly at the Fund of Clinton, former President Bill Clinton received approximately $5,3 million in terms of honors, and the former State Secretary claimed that the issuer of Simon & Schuster had an income for its book of residence at the State Department.
The Potential Vice-President Clintton, Senator of the United States, Tim Kein from Virginia, and his wife Anna Holton, had reported tax declarations for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set financial transparency standards," said Clinton Jennifer Palmer's adviser.
In the opposite of them, Donald Trump is hidden after the underlying justifications and violates his former promises to reveal its tax declarations.
This is a common case for candidates in the presidents of the United States to make their tax declarations, although the law does not require it.
The New York Businessman Trump and his staff called for the verification of the State Tax Service as a reason for its refusal to announce their tax declarations.
"Your walk," wrote the adviser of the preliminary state of Clinton Jan S's, in terms of the candidate's declaration of the democratic party.
On Thursday, the Special Adviser of Trumpa Michael Cohen told CNN that it would not allow the Trump to release them before checking.
Thrumpa's critics, including the candidate in the president of the Rep of the Party in 2012, said that his refusal was addressed to his status, his favourable contributions, his business operations and other links, including Russia.
Clinton was arrested for this issue and on Friday, the video was released on the Internet, where the main place was carried out to the publishing replies to the people who had delivered the Trump to report the tax report.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during the economic issue of Michigan.
"He refuses to do what each candidate had done without exception in the president for decades: to reploy his tax declarations," she said with those who were.
The newspaper Politico reported that Trump had not paid any or almost any taxes for two years in the 1990s, but the business visits of New York Times on Wednesday, quoted a lot of tax charges and buyers, which believed that the cases might be so far.
The taxes of the federal tax were subject to the presidential elections.
Clinton supported the rule of honour of the invitor Warren Baffet, which would guarantee that persons receiving more than 1 million dollars per year would cost a tax amount of at least 30 per cent.
President Barak Obama also supported the proposal.
At the meeting with Clinton last week in Omah, in Nebraska, Baffet, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, proposed Trompe to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Baffet said he was also under IRS check, and Trump's fearing not the tax collection agency, but the electors.
Clinton's pre-elected state has announced tax declarations until 2007.
The Clintons currently in Chappaqua, New York, have made an average federal tax amount of approximately 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective total tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
Clinton's statement for 2015 by that, despite the majority of Americans, only 100 dollars of their income were payable.
Their main investment was a worthless Index Payment Fund, and Clintons stated that the debtors and capital income were $109,000.

Preservatives with chile and feedingstuffs increase the protection of the dance slones
Environmental fighters in Tanzania use a non-traditional way to prevent the elefants from traveling to the populations — the preservatives filled with a chili.
The method was effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had come to this idea a few years ago, together with the American Natural Protection Committee, took its movement by training volunteers in Northern Tanzania villages and using the four steps to protect their homes and seeds without the cause of animals.
Many earlier spy copys to protect themselves.
On Friday, the World Day of Elfenbens will be dedicated to the protection of animals.
"From the way we have received a set of instruments, we have observed the change within these communities, so they are much more confident that the figs will not leave the sloves on their fields, without the cause of the slones of the Honeyguide Bell," said the Executive Director Honeyguide Damian Bell in the statement.
The first two steps are in the burning of the cake before the slone limit and the signals by the corner.
If it couldn't be disappointed, let it go.
The powder of the chili mixed with the ground is placed with a boy in the preservates, and his end is covered, and outside there is only a fitil.
In the burning of preservates, it is covered with the grass, racing the milk of the powder of the skin in the air.
One spirit is usually enough to expand the slone on the other side.
The border measure is a road device that shoots the Roman snakes in the air, produceing a sound, light explosion.
To Turkey, 32 Turkish diplomats were not returned to this portion, who left the country after the trial of the hostship in July of this year.
These data were reported by the Chapter of Turkey's Middle Mevlut Chavushoglu in conversation with journalists.
At the first stage, we responded to 208 frame diplomats to continue in the centre.
32 of them were not returned without objective reasons and explications," said the chapter of the Turkey External Policy.
On the fact that in July, in Turkey, an attempt was made.
The authorities of the country have officially declared that the hostship was lost and reported that more than six thousand people were detained, including military works of higher and medium-sized.
As a result of the temptation of Mrs. Turkey's Mid-Turkey, 290 people were killed.
The repository of the Berlin Hotel was quickly criticized for the removal of Israel's phone code by "demand" of Arabs -- reported the RT News channel
The French Jewish register solved a scandal in the MMI, found that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no phone code in Israel, while the workers were on "demands" from Arabian customers.
Claude Lanzman, author of the documentary film on Holocoste "Shoa", expressed his deficit to Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, wrote an open letter in the German FAZ FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Hotel Lanceman, he tried to find Israel in the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among States where to call directly from the comma.
How could Israel have been excluded in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?
He wrote Lanceman.
Kempinski Bristol replaces the opportunity to take Israel through its own phone service center.
In the search for explaining, the register raised this issue on the standing of the hotel administration.
The answer he received there, according to Lanzman, "the shock of him".
Clark Hotel said that this measure was a "dumped decision to guide the Kempinski Hotels Network".
The reason behind this step was to be a great wrath of the register.
"The majority of our guests in Arabia, and they need to remove the code of Israel," he said, according to Lanzman's officer hotel.
The employee of Israel in Germany, James Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "anxious damage", reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a shame.
What happened in Germany and just in this hotel network, it is still a big damage.
There are no explanations needed here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," said the complainant.
Instead, there was a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
It was said that Kempinski's hotel was just "behavior" in the preferred Arab customers' requirements.
"It would be ashamed," said another post, where it was indicated that the hotel at the glorious Kurfurstendamm Street is near the synagogue.
The hotel himself has succeeded with any accusations called "inspection" and "excusing" before Lanceman, reports the journal Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct vision to not include Israel in a quick set list," quoted by the representative of the hotel Kempinski, Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that code is now added.
Police uses trailing gas and rezin powder against protesting Brazil students
Students met in the city of San Paulo in Brazil on Thursday, when they were gathered to protest against government reforms of the public education system.
The ispo police had a trailer gas and a resistant anti-protectors.
Bes started when the police were trying to disturb students, and the police had caused rezin-poules and trace gases.
Several hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their concern in the conduct of plans.
In the proposals of the Governor of San Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public media schools will be closed and 300 000 students will be re-distributed to calculate money.
Some protest participants could be seen in writing on the walls of Graffiti against the provisional competence of President Michael Themer.
This last protest occurred only in a few days after the protesters went out on the street to support the remote president of Dilmu Ruseph when the country seat voted for its impication.
The trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 %, reporting the RT Business portal
With distorted sanctions, the goods fighting between Moscow and Tegeran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, according to Russia ' s sentence to Iran Levan Gigarran.
Since the sanctions against Iran were dismissed, the increase in interest from the Russian companies in the field of business in the country is observed, said the employee.
Russian companies renewed contacts with Iran and new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, the further trade extension is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagarian said.
He noted that, in the first five months of 2016, the fight between Russia and Iran was increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and with $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and with $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, up to 158 million dollars.
Increasing trade was through the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” said the employee.
Jagarian also predicts that Russia will visit a recorded number of Iranian tourists in this year.
Last year, the Russian representation of Iran has issued approximately 35,000 visions, mainly tourist citizens of Iran.
Furthermore, Iran first entered the top-20 countries by the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It may be assured that the last year record on the number of Iranian tourists, visiting Russia, will be killed," he said.
At the same time, few Russians visit Iran that the employee hopes to change.
"I personally recommend visiting the city of Isfahan, Shiraz and Jez, where memories of ancient Persian civilization are maintained in a good state," he said.
The State continues to cross the ships in defence-industrie complex.
The conduct of freedom became "the system of non-compliance" of the director's orders to "Almaz-Antey", "the release in  skuld" and "the loss of confidence".
It was appointed by Gennadi Benderski as NGO for the next three years.
The Neskorod's release was only on Thursday evening and did not cause a wide range in the MMI.
How can such silence be explained in terms of the extent of overcoming the army?
The RF is probably not wishing to spread any hearing or negative suggestions in the public.
This recently confirms that a defence-industrial complex (OPC) exists and that the State does not want to take them greater attention from the society.
The elimination of the Neskorod is, of course, an important event from the view of the visit to adults.
NGO " Almaz" is a concert undertaking specialised on the production of zenit-racked complexes (CRK) of sea-based and earthquake.
Almaz is currently working on the creation of the Polyment-Redut and Morphei, which are planned to set up on new coverages, freights, exhibitors and crysters.
Osnows’ Portal of Military Russia Dmitriy Cornev believes that the discharge of Neskorodov is caused by a deterioration of the projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, once Morphei started in 2007, and the introduction was expected in 2013.
"Poliment-Redut" must be the main WHO system on the newest WMF ships.
According to the information I received, in several years of trial, there was no real successful trial.
Truth, as long as I can judge, there is no unique guilt of Almaza, " said Cornev.
The expert fears that the delay in the exploitation could also occur with the C-500 CRK.
Experience on the project has not been completed until 2016, but the first complexs must be taken into military.
The Minor Defence assures that " the planning is being carried out and all will be completed for the time set out", although the knowledge recognised the problems with C-500 in 2014.
It is difficult to give the Professional Qualities of Neskorod, which has been made by the Almaz since 2011.
Cornew states that the delays of projects may be as well as the cause of freedom.
It believed that in recent years, it was extremely difficult to obtain information on internal processes in the OPC and the management plans.
The greenhouse has received long-term orders for tens of billion rubles, and great money likely loves silence.
Normally, the Director of Defence Company is debt by its own desire, by the agreement of the parties or by translating to another.
In this case, the elimination has occurred publicly, even though there was no reason.
This points out that the "Almaza" rue was likely a straptic figure and was opposed to the low top of the "divisions".
In view of all, the State has no more peace with such behavior.
It will remove those who prefer Mino defence institutions and do not carry out the tasks set out in the hands of the shareholders.
At the same time, the RF is trying to punish the administrators of tests.
Increasing attention to the issues of the sector is personally given to the President.
Vladimir Putin is headed by the military industry committee and periodically held meetings dedicated to the disappointment.
Criml protects several OCP managers, seeking to have a loyal set of directors, which will carry out the top of the distribution.
This is a far-independent policy, but there are no other instruments in the State at the background of corruption and the lack of normal competition.
The situation in defence, of course, is not catastrophic but the current geopolitical situation stimulates Chreml as far as possible to bring armed forces in order.
In parallel to the " shut" Officers in the OPC, RF leads to successful steps to increase the professionalism of the Russian armies.
The carrier of the Army has received a new quality with the post of the Defence Minister of Sergei Shago.
It is impressive that the president took the "Woe to the World - prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military force of the SSR and the nuclear parity in the 1970 ' s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pakt, which has strengthened the Moscow impact on the continent.
In all the deficiencies of the bipo system, it worked effectively.
The evidence of this was the lack of wars on the continent of Pekah and the situation in the Middle East.
The consequences of the " winners" in the cold war have resulted in strengthening international terrorism.
After a series of therapies in the United States and "civilised world", please have no relaxed ear.
Despite the general disaster, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of equal partner.
In such conditions, the only aliens of our country remain float and army.
The strengthening of the military power will allow Moscow to make national interests more effective and to go to new global policies.
Scotch Calum Skinner is a final line, and the British people are taking a bicycle of gold
The Scottish Calum Skinner was moving to triumph in a man's order pressure at Rio last night, thus the British Royal Triumph protected its title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgo was in the role of his school friend, Mr. Chris Hoy, made his own, and a young man fiercely entered the story, broke in the finish line to throw a victory from the Favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain declared the right to unexpected winning four years ago when Hoy declared the right to the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the truck, after finishing six shortly on the March World Champion on the trailing wheelongs in London, despite that Hoy has completed the career from now on.
The question between Peking and London was replaced by the specialist of Jamie Staff.
They did the same time when Hindes arrived.
The Road of Hoja also created an empty place that Kian Emaddy and Mea Crempton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British trainers, seeing the potential in Scotland, which was now called.
Hindes, Kenny, campaigns with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner set an Olympic record in the kwality, but the standard was overcome by New Z in the first round.
And the British Trio wined a dual for gold.
Hindes was right behind his circle, but Kenny broke the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change was a major part of the transition, where Hindes went to a greater transfer to quiet and allow Kenny to maintain the temperature of Skyner.
He observed from his place as an invited BBC expert and viewed Skyner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the piedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgo said, "This is a forest comparison."
I'm here to make everything possible and make my name.
We set the Olympics record in the final and won the world campaigns.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After the triumph in London in 2012, with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes recognized a mentally falling on the track after a failure start.
He later refused to comment, and there was no way to call the British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like in London, with all the British flags at the court."
We're all like the team in the last three months.
We lost so many gangs with the world's name that the winning of the olympide was just a spectacular.
This is one business, one golden medal for the country, who won seven of the 10 named bones both in Peking and in London.
If this is a progress bar meter in the last five months, the wheel is waiting for five more successful days.
With the form demonstrated by Kenny, it is not in some way the possibility of repeating Hoy by wining three Olympical golden medals in some games.
This would allow Kenny, who was 12 years older than Hoy, who also was born on 23 March (that is, a dedicated date in the British, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgreiv, Mo Farach and Roger Bunnister) to account for six gold medals and one silver.
It would be like Hoy.
Kenny's next time in a print that begins today and is playing for three days.
The 28-year-old exit from Bolton said, "I just enjoy this now.
Commands are always the best.
You're coming to win with your friends.
It's a little alone to win one if honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two other golden medals, he has to get rider."
It was the only day for medals, but there were the following good news for British.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clans, Stephen Burk and Owen Doll are qualified by the fastest four-chiffy-km-management order.
They're finishing at 3:51.943.
The peace record set on the winning of gold in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 dinner) will be present today, on the second day of the business, where Wiggins will be in the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the Commissioners yesterday when he had to measure his weight.
Laura Trottt, John Roussel Chand, Elinor Barker and Cathy Archibald from Milngavi have improved the world record at 4:13.260.
The British Deputy came to believe the potential team of bicycles to take the average period of Olympic Games and to enjoy a lot of medals.
Following in fact exceptional demonstrations of full preference in Peking and London, the expectations were weak in progressive preparation for Rio.
There were dramas on the second plan, not after the exit of the position of the technical director of Shane Sa in April because of accusations of this art and pressure, and the outcome of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the first dinner's trail on the wheel, that now the Great Britain's glorious glorious achievement of the top at the appropriate time may be as soon as it is again.
The future Portland carrier metals are threatened because of the distortion of electricity contract
The future Portland Aluminium Charter in Victoria, as well as the hundreds of slaves, is threatened because, according to one of the owners of the carrier, the electricity company, which is deployed, is going to break the delivery contract: it is planned that all delivery contracts will be distorted.
This step is the result of the decision adopted earlier by the Government of Victoria this year not to continue the subsidies provided for for support for the functioning of the business.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2.000 slaves can be threatened by Alcoa's carrier in Portland.
A total of 2,000 slaves — directly and indirectly — can be risked by any closure.
It can also be added to direct consequences, since the metaluric carrier consumes approximately 10 per cent of the entire electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa concluded a metal carrier at Point Henry, which led to the closure of the electricity station in England last year.
Alcoa's Portland Metalurgy carrier loses money and risks closing.
These actions have become a comprehensive consideration of the future insurance, continued for several years, particularly by the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later by the price of the production of the cargo.
The AGL Company, who has a major aluminium electricity engine from its Loy Yang A station in Latrobi Valley, reported that it expects other three owners to take steps to deal with the agreement.
The controlling share of the carrier belongs to the joint short-term company of Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp belong to the smallest parts.
"The AGL company expects that the Portland object continues to work, meaning that the physical issue of electricity from the metalurgy of the carrier will not be stopped," she said.
According to the AGL company, the contracts were so called ' hedged contracts ' to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month dilution period, so they are actually finished in 2017.
"The AGL's company still expects that these contracts will bring part of its income in the financial year 2017," said the electricity company.
Anyway, the potential impact on the AGL acquisition of the 2018 financial year has been set up by the current prognoses on the market of fuckers for optical electricity prices.
The AGL firm stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its report to $187 million in terms of "continuing discharge".
According to Alcoa, the decision to distort contracts "not affects the ability of Alcoa to manage a metaluric carrier or to ensure the supply of electricity on the metal carrier".
The American company claimed that in 2010, Loy Yang had concluded a twenty-year-old agreement that had to enter into force in November of this year, but she would still have to explain why it had distorted the contract.
The analyses were afraid of the possible closing as well as the Portland metalurge of the carrier in Victoria as well as the carrier of Tomago near Newcastle because of a disadvantaged economic situation in adults.
By turning to analyses earlier this week, AGL Stephen Mickelssen said that Portland uses about 600 megawats of energy each year and Tomago is approximately 900 megawats.
If both of them leave the market, a significant reduction in the market [electricity] will occur.
For us, as for the manufacturer, it will be bad," he said.
Not only a star to show the Cardassian, Kendall on the box of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, the model and the fourth daughter of the Cardashian-Gener of Chris' mother manager, appeared on the headquarters of the American Journal of Vogue in September.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder branch and the defil of mode's weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news at its account at Instagram on Thursday.
"When I'm in the camel together with my favorite people, I'm looking at this box and weeping," Kendall wrote.
The news on the cover was strange (or simply in the spirit of the Cardassian Family?), prepared for video, in which the whole family of Cardassian-Gener (deboширed Rob and Caitlin, also accompanied by the universal favorite charity of the show business, producer of the Cardassian family, Ryan Sicrest), forgot the appearance of a sister in the coast, and finally classic turn: they are a party-surprise plan.
This is a standard line of pressing nearly all the events of television shows dedicated to birthday (Circlest states: "Did you think we forgot about you?" with sincerity of a multi-screen of the program on 8th morning), but Chris needed to have this glory in the way or in the case of others.
Because with this episode, dedicated to the September Vogue number, we certainly entered the new epoch of the Kardashian show.
Let the elderly sister Kendall Kim fall on the Vogue surface earlier (they came on with her husband Canye West in April 2014), but the September magazine is a achievement of herself.
The September is the most sold issue of Vogue per year.
A larger likeness of a gift than the model magazine, the exhibition is attached to a large number of advertisers (based on Fashionist port, 615 pages of the previous 832-page issue contained an advertising).
The news of those in the stars who will fall on his cover is so impatient that in the last two years of the magazine has been reported to the official announcement.
The number of previous women, papa's on the cover, includes Naomi K'Pbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In the past years, there have been, of course, more "significants working in models" than "models I've been embraced."
Laureat Prize Oscar and the face of Dior Jennifer Lawrence was presented in 2013 on the cover, after a year after Lady Gage had expired.
But even in that little probably case, if Jenner, described as a "educating model" of his generation, falls into the first category, it is in a bad company.
These beauty are not I'm the family of people, stars of show or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (Jenner's falling into all these categories).
They are actually talenting women who succeed in the industry of times.
This year was one of the most successful ones in the career in relation to the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, it's not all good for Jenner's success.
The situation of Jenner in the world of mode, in view of its past television star, was always to be a treasure.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stepheny Simur described Jenner and her colleague Gidji Hadid, who called them "sockets at the moment".
These instructions were again disappointed after the news of Jenner's appearance in Vogue.
But it doesn't have any meaning for failure.
Kendall Jenner on the box of September Vogue.
It is a supermodel in all the senses of this word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a tone cream from Estee Lauder.
She, both her sisters and her sisters, sell you their letters in their own applications available on a signature.
She sells the photographs made manually to Cindy Crawford magazine LOVE.
And in a free time, perhaps to continue to see her sister Cortney and her children, she participates in TV show.
Common legal centres reject 160 000 persons per year
Each year, more than 160 000 lowest protected representatives are refused to serve in public legal centres, since this sector is prepared for the efficacy that will result in a further disruption of the activity and so already undertaken.
In Queensland, three of the five — mainly, elderly, immigrants, unprofit slaves, victims of violence, people who have no opportunity to deal with unrighteous loss of property and so far – have already been rejected by seeking free legal assistance and representation.
Common legal services already working on the parts of the Community are prepared for further reductions.
Since June of the year, these legal centres must lose more 30 per cent of federal employment.
The Director of the Common Legal Centres of Queensland James Farrell said that the report of the recent report of the National Association of Communities of Legal Centres has been rejected for thousands of people a year.
Farrell said that if the Federal Government ' s decision was not canceled, the situation would only be harmful.
"The public legal centres of Queensland are still insufficient: that means that thousands of people are rejected in their lively important services," he said.
People with uncontrolled and devastating, families walking through divorce, unfairly dismissed slaves — all of them have problems of legal nature, and this report shows that they cannot receive help in which they need.
The Federal Government will determine 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected people of Queensland will be forced to resolve complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator Quinsland, George Brandis, to cancel these reductions immediately so that people can receive aid when they are faced with legal problems.
Last year, the Government has fulfilled its commitment to enhance the free legal aid to the average country indicator.
It has now been time to focus on the needs of public legal centres and communities, their customers, and the Government of Palašuk is able to join this important.
The pre-elected state of Donald Trumpa was sent to the court after it was approved that he threatened with a gun
According to New York reports, the pre-elected state of Donald Tromp was sent to the court: as appealed, the staff did nothing after the report that his operating director in Northern Carolina threatened the gun when they were driven to the jeep in February.
The incident was described in the court in the middle of the State court in Charlotte Vincent Bordin, an ex-programing ensuring officer in the pre-selected state.
Bordin said he had waited for a few months to solve the problem in the internal order, but he realized that "it would not happen."
Director Earl Phillip, "he took a gun, put his right indicator finger on the pitch and put a dust on Vincent's knees," says Bordin in the complaint.
By welcome to the pre-electional and regional administration, Bordin realized that at least four other people were participants of similar incidents with Philly, it was approved in the treatment.
"The walls are not obliged to shoot to cause damage," said Bordin in the complaint.
Isk had occurred only two days after the candidate in the president of the Republic of the Party had come a furoon, saying to the listeners in North Caroline that "the second amendment of people" — who are known as the owners of the weapons and his lovers — could begin to start if his adversary, Hillary Clinton, is chosen and will be elected to judges.
Thrumpa's pre-elected staff said that the MMI had removed its words from the context and that he had not been expressed in support of violence.
In its complaint, Bordin requires compensation from the pre-elected staff for non-border control and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, for moral violence and for the cause of morality.
The representative of Trumpa Hoop Hix is slow to answer the request for comments.
The attempts to talk to Philly did not have success.
WCCB, a news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently gone out of the pre-election station.
In response to the call in his consular company, the Innovation Consult Services, no one called back quickly.
The candidate at the president of the Republic of Donald Tromp held a campaign.

Britain must enlarge the olympical spirit and expand Hitrou
Hitrou will also bring rebuilding and flowing not only in our extensive populations and in general in London, but also throughout the country.
As I think, this was exactly the great benefit of Hitrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we had all efforts to benefit our people and regions from the Game.
The Olympic Games have benefited greatly for Stratford and East And.
And we'll do this again by creating opportunities for people and company near Hitrow.
Only for our close populations, we will create 10 000 new stages, 40 000 new slaves and end the youth without the airport around.
Like before London 2012, those who believe that Hitrous extension is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for Olympics games and that we would be in a workplace on the world area.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will prove their mistakes in the conduct of Hitrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hitrou answers any question.
The Olympical Hitrou Game is a infrastructure project for most people, not only for a wide range.
Enlargement is the opportunity to create up to 180 000 new slaves, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, allowing the inheritance of sciences and occupation around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a team in Hitrow, which introduced a programme of 11 billion billion pounds of infrastructure in the time and in the budget areas, from T5 is the best terminal of the airport five years ago, up to T2, built in the middle of the two highest aeroplane stations in the world.
They are now ready to ensure the third year-based period under 16 billion pounds of private investments.
Olympic games in London in 2012 were a great success for the United Kingdom, and I am sure the extension of Hitrou will also be.
It was time for us to put the Olympian spirit into the needed roof and expand Hitrou by ensuring our trade future and creating an inheritance of sciences and employment that British people will be proud.
Lord Paul Dayton, Chairman of the Council of Hitrow and former Trade Attasha of the Castle
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays "mouse-coats" on the blocking of the advertising
For companies who buy money on the Internet advertising, attempts to provide a programming for the locking of the advertising are a game in "musk-coat", as one of the companies that create such software.
Thursday, literally after a few days after Facebook announced that the advertising blockers would be blocked on its table version of the site, Adblock Plus opened the record in the blog that users could update their filters in the program to block the advertising on the network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the site's ongoing version changes the wheel around its advertising so that the advertising blockers would become more difficult to recognize what parts of the pages I'm doing in the advertising.
But Adblock now states that he got a new code.
In his blog, the Representative Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of fight between the locking community with the open source code and those trying to join it continue from the time of the locking of the advertising," and maybe Facebook will have its own decision in the nearby time.
The fact that the most important network in the world has been in the fight is a clear sign of the major problem of the advertising claimers for the industry.
Over the world, about 200 million people are using advertising blocks, which are given in the previous year of Pagefair and Adobe; nearly four times more of those who have spent such programming in 2013.
The mobile advertisement now consists of 84 percent of Facebook income from the advertising.
However, the company follows the advertising lockers on a table version, since the mobile lockers are ineffective in Facebook mobile applications for the network and the Institute, according to the representative.
However, the advertising in the table version is a sufficient income article to make Facebook a step in such a profitable investment.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to renew its "advertising preferred" tool to provide people more control over how the advertising is acquired.
On Thursday, Facebook said that new Adblock filters would cause anxiety, because they would also block some non-reclamable content on the website.
"This will not be a local experience for people, and we are planning to solve this problem," said Facebook representative in an official electronic letter.
Advertising blockers are a cruel tool, so we focused on the creation of instruments such as Advertising preferred to transfer management into human hands.
The woman was moved to the Swiss car travel at a manifest suicide
Girtva was on the carway in the midnight.
The police invites witnesses after the woman had moved several vehicles on the road early on Thursday in a manifest self-mord trial.
The incident occurred at A1 near Morge in the canton in the fight after midnight on Thursday.
The woman put it on the road in the darkness of the "best discouragement" and was struck by several vehicles, reported by the police in the statement.
Apparently, attempting to kill himself, the Switzerland woman at 49 years of age struck several vehicles, including the carrier.
She died on her own.
Several of the leaders have already been asked, but the identity of some of them has not been set up before, reported by the police who calls them and someone else who was a witness to the event to respond.
A "logical" step in such a situation was excited, said Gile Hoftsteter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is still necessary to find out whether any of the leaders in question would be charged.
Did it be possible to escape a hit?
This is what the prosecutor must determine," Hoftstetter said.
Two other similar cases in the last five years have been allowed to assume that the drivers are not responsible.
In any case, both of whom a person walking in the darkness of the car was sentenced that the cars could not expect a accidental meet with a travel in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was justified by the cause of death for insight after he struck and killed a person on A1 near Pierne night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim was drunk and lost a conscience of the road, listened to the court.
The Court discovered that a police woman, who responded to an extreme call, managed by a vehicle that was based on the way and that the person's presence on the road was "a completely exclusive and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who holds an incident on Thursday near Morge must call 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Cly's NASA model: Venera was ever inhabited
The Venera may have ever been a resident, assessing the new climate of the NASA model .
Students from the National University of Goddard's Space Research Institute have once a model for the study of the past Venera, using instruments and algorithms similar to those applied by climate.
The model was once designed to determine whether on Venera, with its warm waterless surface and the atmosphere transplanted by oxygen gas, could ever have the conditions like the earth.
Scientists earlier assumed that the small rotation speed of Venera was explained by its fleshly atmosphere.
But the last modeling suggests that Venera might be able to have a divorced atmosphere like the earth, and still turn slowly.
The model also examines the topic of the early Venera.
On the planet, probably, there were more dry regions than on Earth, but sometimes there was enough water and geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent quickness.
Earlier Veneer also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent of the tuscle.
"See the GISS model that the Slow Rotation of Venera is submitting its daily side of the sun nearly two months once," explained the report for the printing of the GISS Anthony Del Henio.
This burns the surface of the planet and produces a rain that creates a deep layer of clouds that protects the surface of the planet from the solar heat.
The result of me is the average climate temperatures, which, as amazing, are a few degrees colder than today on earth.
The model shows the history of Venera, similar to the development of the former planet study specialists.
Although Venera may have been inhabited, she has been affected by too big heat and ultraviolet exhaust during several billion years.
Her oceans were sprayed and her water couple was burned with ultraviolets.
When its hydrogen was flying, only the physical atmosphere of oxygen gas with the effect of the parking effect was Venera, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate of Venera model in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy leaves the post of the Avalanche team trainer
Patrick Roy left the post of the trainer and the vice-president of the Colorado Avalanche activity on Thursday, taking into account the lack of influence during the decision-making process of the team.
The Executive Vice-President/Chapter of the Color Team of Jo Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club would start looking for a new trainer immediately.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my responsibility to the main trainer and vice-president of the hockey activity Colorado Avalanche with energy, ability and determination," said the 50-year Roy in the statement.
During the years, I was thinking about how I could improve this team to add her deepness and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this objective, the vision of the trainer and vice-president of the hockey activities should be perfectly compatible with the view of the organization.
He must also have the right to vote in making decisions affecting the team.
These conditions are not fulfilled at this time.
Sakik, who took Roy on 23 May 2013, welcomed Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we want him to succeed in the future.
Roy's laureat of Jack Adams Award as the best trainer of the ligue during his first season with the team Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He brought the club to 112 eyes and wins in the Central Division, but Colorad was disappointed by Minnesto in the first round of play-offs and lost play-off for two years.
The Avalanche command announced 39-39-4 at the 2015-2016, and on five stakes, the Wild team was left in the fight against the second fair trip to participate in the West Conference.
The brother from the Slave Hall, Roy won four Cube Stanley — two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
Northern Sea oilers renewed negotiations and stopped the destruction
Workshops on oil payment in Northern Sea are stopped, and all parties of the discussion access to the new round of negotiations reported by the leading representatives of the parties.
Wood Group's ships against the naftersite company were consistently organized in the North Sea of Royal Du Shell.
"Wood Group and Unitede and RMT Unions may confirm that we agreed to renew negotiations for the authorisation of currents," says the joint statement.
We will take a few meetings a full day for several weeks, starting from the beginning of the week to look at the issues of fresh view.
Professionals reported that their recent action, which, according to them, was the first of more than 25 years, was addressed against the potential reductions of the payment to 30 per cent.
The Wood Group has reduced the rate paid by contract workers in the North Sea by approximately 9 per cent due to the negative pressure of the market.
The reduction of rate from the company has occurred after the 10% reduction of rate for contractual employees in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions will give her the space necessary to overcome the market fall.
Shell's company, on its own, reduced thousands of people and announced the plans to stop oil activities in countries up to 10, since it rationalised its activity as a result of its mega-slipping with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lowness of prices for unclean oil: the economic situation was deteriorated because of the decision to get out of the Union adopted in June of Britain.
The Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met professional leaders this week earlier to discuss one of the greatest working conflicts arising in the North Sea at the time.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that would work for most people, not only for some," he said in the statement.
Less than 1.4 billion dollars for new projects in Northern Sea are expected in 2016, with an average contrast of about 7 billion dollars in the past five years.
Ke'r measures the speed of turning the stars to the Plaid Sco
After the telescope hair mission, Ke'r helped the astronomes to collect the most full catalogue of star rotation in the Plaid.
The new data helps the astronomes to understand why the stars are rotated with different speeds and how the rotation periods are related to the design of the planet.
"We hope that comparing our results to other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass stars, its age and even the history of its solar system," is the race in the report for Louise Ribal, the Scientific Centre of Infrastructure and the analysis of the Californian Technology Institute.
Playad's composition is in 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars now have reached growth; they were born approximately 125 million years ago.
They turn so quickly as they will never be.
These growing stars raise large numbers of star winds on their pick-up rotation speeds.
By traveling through the star fields, these winds show a covering wind on the stars.
As long as the star is old, its rotation speed begins to be quiet.
Cae measures the speed of rotation of each star, following the time between the appearance of known star fibres, such as sunsets.
The newer rotation directory suggests that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Ribale compares stars with dancers: more larger are making piroetes slower than smaller.
"In "Ballet" Playad we observe that those who turn slowly are usually more massive, while those who turn faster are usually related to very easy stars," said Ribalt.
Since Playad is so close, it serves a perfect space of the laboratory to compare star properties with rotation speeds.
"Plaida's external coverage provides a sending point for the theoretical models of rotation of stars both younger and older," race-Ribal.
We want to learn much more about where and why the stars relax their speed of turning and wheat on their "dance-toffles" thrilled.
Ribal and her colleagues have expressed their last analysis of Played's turnover in three new articles, which will soon be repeated in the Astronamic magazine.
The investigation of a group of Ukrainian Diversants in Crimea is conducted by two scientists, says "Commercent."
The FSB collects evidence of the participation of those detained to prepare divergences in Crime.
As reported earlier, you recognize the statement of the inhabitants of the Ukrainian city of Energodar of the Pans agreed to cooperate with the consequences.
According to his statement, he considered the "Tithan" chemical in Armensk, the oilbase in the Federation, the Carchen Parking Transmission, the Gas Leader and one of the military aircrafts.
The rightsguardians believe that it has been successful to detain all divergences.
This has, in particular, been made for the arrest of the suspicious in the Kiev Court of Simferopol.
Main trainer of Russia for football
At the meeting of the Colonel of the Russian Football Union, a decision was taken to be appointed to the main council trainer of Russia on the football of Stanislav Cherchesov.
The contract with it will be calculated for two years before the end of the CM-2018.
On August 11, the RFS appointed at the post of the main trainer of Russia on the Stanislav Churches' football.
It's a former footballist playing in Moscow "Spartake" at the position of the door, as well as a trainer with a solid experience, who was a teacher of Russian teams such as the same "Spartak", "Sportugine-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dinamo", as well as the Barshaw Legi, who became the winner of the national priority and the cube of the country.
It is reported that the Treaty with Cherchew will be signed at the closest time and calculated for two years.
Thus, he has the obligation to prepare a collection for the world campaign in 2018.
It is known that the Miroslav Romachenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panicus will be entered in his training station.
There are information about which the payment of all train stations is 2.6 billion per year.
According to the MMI, the RFS guided Stanislav Church's goal to bring Russia to half-final and win medals.
As the trainer himself said, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and will give the footballists the opportunity to demonstrate himself.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he's glad that the choice fell on him.
The first catch under the leadership of Cherchez's assembly will be held on 31 August in Antal, which will be a companion meeting with the Turkish team.
On the previous post of the Russian main trainer's football collection, Leonid's associated with the CSCA club.
He announced his exemption from post after the exemption of the Russian National Team on the year-2016, in France.
In addition, he took responsibility for the bad results of the collection.
Angola and UAR, Namibia was very harmful during the long fight against the apartment.
However, after obtaining independence from Southern in 1990, this country with a population of 2.4 million has achieved great success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for the success of Namibia is that the Government is focusing on education.
While people in developed countries consider themselves free primary and medium education, in many poor countries in the middle and even starting schools require training.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce training for the "payment of costs".
However, education in the early schools is free in Namibia.
Moreover, since 2015, the average education has been free.
The authorities of the countries also work actively in other important ways.
The effort to make ma has been reduced by 97 per cent in the last ten years.
Despite the international trend of inequality, it is reduced in Namibia.
In comparison with the 1993 Coffee of Gini, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, was 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this indicator was one of the highest ones in the world.
The poverty level was reduced from 69% in 1993 to less than 30%.
The number of people in extreme poverty (not less than $1,90 per day) has also been reduced from about 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia is also the highest in the assessment of the freedom of words, given by the " Reporters without frontiers".
The country prejudiced substantially the United States and other rich states.
In addition, the country has a favourable review - one of the highest in the Index of the Recognition of Corruption - which constitutes a legal defense of Transparency International.
Even now, when the prices on the grid are fallen, Namibia is able to maintain the high levels of growth.
At the same time, the BDP is about 25%, which constitutes less than 1/3 levels in the United States and most of the countries.
Of course, there are some problems in Namibia.
The level without a level, at least by traditional methods, remains sufficiently high - almost 28 per cent.
Like other countries in the region, the high level of HIV/AIDS disease in Namibia is nearly 17 per cent of the population I have been infected.
According to the Evaluations of the World Bank, Namibia is going to a number of countries with a higher average income, but the authorities are insisting that their State is actually a developing country.
Namibia is certainly faced with some difficulties that arise to developed economys.
State must develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
In the country's territory in the wilderness, isolated cattle tribes of collectors, which should be integrated in the modern society without the loss of their identity.
The integration of people who were on the world economy in the fourth century ago is an uncomfortable task for any country.
For Namibia, it is even more difficult: as any other country in the world, it is affected by the consequences of climate change.
Nevertheless, Namibia has not thought to lay down her hands, but the country has resolved the problems before her.
Almost after the obtaining of independence of the authority, the creation of a diversified economy and a combined society.
It is noted that competitive political fractions were gathered together to work for the general good.
In fact, Namibia is ensuring that the medical service is not only its own citizens but also its neighbors.
Approximately 15-20 per cent of the visitors of the Medical Institute in the North of Namibia are Angola citizens.
No one in Namibia speaks of the building of a wall that would have a country from poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that neighbors were not choosing and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate with deficit water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to promote investment and exchange students.
Furthermore, the Government of Namibia has justified that rich natural resources can be easily cursed by promoting riches for many.
The authorities understand that income from Namibia ' s natural riches must be contributed to the infrastructure and productive powers.
They also recognize that it would be unresponsible to avoid obtaining the maximum revenue from the country's sale of resources and revising investment laws and contracts to ensure that it is so.
Transparency is a crucial importance for this process, so strong support by the Government of freedom of words is so important.
As the Chapter of Hague Gaingob said, the MMI often say what he doesn't like.
But after fighting for the freedom of the apartment in the South Namibias, it must protect the freedom received, says the President.
Not all the key resources of Namibia I'm discharged.
It is such as fishing, which refers to the renewable, and the Government is taking all efforts to maintain and strengthen them.
Each year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries who begin with serious deficiencies — racism, employment, inequality and low development — can rise to general flowing.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard about the Golden Warna - the oldest gold items created by humans (4600 to 4200 years before our era).
Please, this was the greatest geological sentence in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, when the Barnean Necropolis is cut off, the number of gold artefacts was found - more than three thousand total weight of 6 kg.
Only one of the preservation, which is "mogil No. 43", was made of 990 gold items at a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the older world’s gold can soon go to the invisible type of busy found by the geologs in July of this year.
In Bulgaria again, it is a history of the population, such as the Tell of Younaci.
Despite Varna, the port town, Tel Younaci is divorced from the sea, near the village of the United States of Pazardjiki.
The bus is a golden wheel that is turned into the ring.
Javor B’Jijev, who was a deployer in the Tell of Younaci, dated 4600 years before our era and stated that she was older than Warna's gold at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna are dated about the same period, 4600 to 4200 B.C.E.
Technology that allows the metal to be dated without prejudice does not exist at present.
How, then, is it confidence that what gold is more ancient?
Professor B'Jiv obviously knows more than he reported to the Reʹs Agency: "I am absolutely sure that the gold of the Younaci is greater than the gold of Varna."
This is an exceptional importance: it is a crucial object, but it is a great enough to take a similar place in the history.
In the Interview of Re日s B, scientists have been analyzing the composition of the metal in the nearby time, as well as re-examining the geological layer where the gold artephate was found.
This will help to date the bus with the maximum accuracy possible.
The place of finding also explains much.
The Tell Younaci is a famous village, even if you never heard of it.
The Tell Younaci is currently considered the oldest "town".
Tel was the descendants of people, migration in Anatolia (the modern Turkey) in 7 thousand years before our age.
In the past centuries, the metabolism of the region was cruelly developed from the first metabolic skills to the creation of a full-valuable industry.
The patriotic history for this geological community contains a name: Ba'no Carpathian Metalurgy province.
In five thousand years before our ears around the center of metallob, the city of the city began to be inhabited.
They are now called the oldest cities.
There may be the oldest Tell Younaci, because there were 4900 years before our eras.
I would call Thel Younaci protots of the modern city, although it is a very ancient residence, even compared to theropotomia.
"This is the place of a thousand years older than Shumer," says B'Jijev, meaning the generally adopted opinion that the urban culture was born in the south ofropathia, the modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the usual understanding of this word.
The depths of the Tell of the Younacas have been conducted since 1976.
At this time, the geology is racious of nearly 12 hectares, which is about the third of the general residence area.
The rest of the strong wall was found, which at times reached three meters high.
The houses and the masters have not been kept, but the geologists are clearly different from the streets, public opinions, city-pleasant building, "work center" and resident areas.
Younaci's telephone often calls "Veaking City": there were tens of birds in the woods.
All birds are pictured in the room, and from here it appeared that they were not the decorative objects, but the object of the colt.
The bird city was disrupted about 4100 years before our era -- perhaps by the Indian tribes coming north-east.
There were no towns, so there were weapons and weapons.
Three-metric strong walls have not stopped them.
Archeologists discovered evident signs of cruel battle: inside the houses were found the rest of older men, women and children with the tracks of the wounds of fighting topores.
New findings and new facts are shown annually by changing the usual views of the ancient history.
Bulgarian geologists often speak not of district cultures but of the "periodic" first civilization of the Ba's.
A powerful stimulation in the search of this civilisation became the gold of Varna, found recently in 1972.
It is logical that the golden rocks of Varna had to have something before, something like a crown of the golden boss created in the Municipal Tell.
In Porsche, model 911 Targa was experiencing
It was officially stated that the preparation of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is conducted manually by a division specialist working with series of machines.
The Retro-Luk is, for example, in the color of the Etna Blue kiss, which has been repeated in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, in this colour even the model logo is cut out.
Furthermore, the market has received a firm white graph at the bottom of boards and 20-degrees RS Spyder wheel disks, as well as some details of the forming of the cups cut in the "white-goilt metal".
In the intersection of the retro-line, it is not less: it is, in large account, distinguishing severe blue gamma, new chairs with expanded electro-regulation areas and black-annoided roads of the division.
Furthermore, each purchase will receive a chocolate for car and a richly acquired album with production process graphs.
The strong establishment of the Porsche Exclusive specialist was not to touch: the retro-tax of characteristics is completely matching the series.
It is based on a six-linder engine with a turbonaid amount of 3.0 l, which develops 420 inches and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version 911 Targa 4S is able to end up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued by a tissue, but the value of any specific sport is not reported.
Facebook and advertising lockers solved "inflammation track"
Recent introduction of Facebook technologies preventing the hiding of the advertising on the sockets pages, a result of the decisionmakers to block the advertising on responsible actions.
AdBlock Plus has been released, but Facebook's planning to do it as a demon.
So AdBlock Plus prophecies is its new technology, which mostly remains effective for a little time
The Society representatives noted that by trying to deny the new "non-blocked" advertising technologies, AdBlock Plus's decision and commercial announcements blocks many common posts from friends or pages.
In Facebook, the AdBlock Plus policy expressed a regret and promised to solve the problem.
As he told the source among times of the TechCrunch edition, the AdBlock Plus is ready for the next hours.
Thus, the sockets and lockers were binding on their kind of "inflammation chain", attempting to play one another, who had suffered, became users who had lost interested records from friends or seeing the advertising where they had not been used to see it.
Ethical and locking of advertising recently causes warm disputes.
In Murmansk, a violent person will stand before the court; the Dinner Murmansk.
His case has already been completed in the Following Committee of the Russian Federation on the Murman Area.
An accusation of 54-year-old man is a very serious compliance with sexual characteristics.
Consequently, at the end of November 2015, Paul's accused in the street in Murmansk acted sexually with violence against 20 years of age.
The sanction provided for in this article provides a maximum penalty in terms of freedom for up to six years.
Dongfeng brings Crosswan Fengguang 370 to Russia and Picap Rich New website After the role of www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the popularity in China’s car class, composing the dignity of the miniature and crossover.
Another Russian Prime Minister is Rich New.
Many Western Moscow car salon firms have decided to ignore this year, so the exhibition rooms of Crocus Expo will be filled with Chinese companies.
In particular, a powerful front will be presented by the Dongfeng Motor corporation, which has large types of Russian markets and which is in the nearest future to offer our self-lovers a number of interesting news.
One of them will be Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which is sold in China at 55 900 yuanian price (at least 550 thousand rubs at the current course).
The Russians are not able to be able to be able to identified as well as the issue of supply in the country until they are in the stage of discussion.
In China, Fengguang 370 per June sales results were able to reach the 11th place in the list of most sold miniatures, although a large road light (175 mm) and a lower perimeter of its cuss can be completely calculated to crossware.
Crosswan is built in the youngest Fengguang model, 360, and 370 is the same road base at 2725 mm, but a little longer (4565 mm against 4510 mm), the design is more solid and the foundation is more rich.
The salon was covered by trees, but the large vertical sensor screen "like Tesla" on the central console was only on the early exhibition exhibitions of crosswan and the sale of the "music" cars was easier.
Five of the seven plants are easily composed by a 1650 mm grade of the grade of the bathroom, a maximum amount of 1500 l.
The engine for Fengguang 370 is only one - 1.5-litre benzine "atmospheric" power 115 PM, consisting of a 5-degree mechanism of transfer.
The manufacturer is quietly silent about the dynamic quality of the car, so it promises the lowly budget of the appointment holder at the level of 6.7 l/100 km.
Picape Rich New is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara of a requested generation, but with almost Chinese stylists design.
Despite morally older, this model is used by a stable question from the Chinese consumer as a trustworthy and unfair "service bow".
At the equivalent price, Rich New is probably interested in the Russian, because modern Japanese pica_ has become very precious.
Rich New is based on two engines on a choice: a benzine of 2.4 l (137 l) or a turbodisel of 2.5 l (116 p.m.).
The transmission box is only a mechanism, the carrier is on the back of the wheels, but there is a mode and a very closely connected "forward".
Dongfeng and the new Flagman seat A9 will be the representation of its Russian Prime Minister of the Chinese company anonso still in June.
Minvenous Crossveres on the Chinese market become more, one of the last news - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
The Russian liner Dongfeng is currently consisting of two models: S30 and H30 Cross.
In the seven months of this year, the Chinese company's diler in 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax reports will be stopped by sending nearly a website on www.zr.ru
The tax inspection has changed the order of reporting on property taxes.
All Russian carriers have used a scheme that has not been changed for years: they receive nearly a quantity of transport tax in the previous year.
However, many of them will not be expected in this year.
The fact is that tax inspection has changed the order of notice of citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Private Tax Agency" on the official site of nalog.ru knowledge will be reported electronically.
Inspection automatically included such Russians as online operators and removed them from the standard "buffer" distribution.
The newness will affect all owners of vehicles and insurance.
All the rest will still receive normal letters.
However, the opportunity to return to the old scheme is also available to the owners of accounting on the website.
They will have to visit the tax service during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more convenient.
The notice will appear in the "personal office" term after the establishment, while the letter will go a few days and can be lost.
The additional number of users of the Internet tax inspection service has overcame 18 million people that will enable the science to severely check out on the postal.
On the other hand, the modesty news on the site of inspection is obviously insufficient to inform the citizens about the changed order.
They could be registered in the "personal office" for a single service and have been forgotten for a long time.
These people will not be able to report nearly, and they will not know that they will fall into a category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the Personal Tax Agenda is three ways: by accounting the port of gosuslugi.ru, using the electronic signature or login and password specified in the register map.
The latest can be received in any tax inspection (without account).
We note that transport tax must be paid until 1 December.
The races of notifications began in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G class, in which there is a very high delivery, is something in itself.
But the concept did not disturb G-Power's masters who were taken for the mode of Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power's appeal to the BMW cars, but nothing of her masters is strange.
Actually, why don't you make G 63 - 571-flying cuvall with aerodynamic dance and split up to a hundred in 5.4 s?
As the "muscles" of the foolish "gelics", the master was used by the advantages that opened a 5.5-litre super-eighty "eight".
And this is the dynamic of the dilution to a hundred increasingly 0.1 s, and now the flying kirpich is able to rive at 5.3 s.
Nevertheless, it is probably much better to him in the meantime.
The speed flow is afraid: if the standard G 63 does not exceed 210 km/h, the tuning traveller with an disabled "electronic" will be able to extinguish 250 km/h.
External cars are almost unlike its maintenance, except other wheel disks - 23-inch Hurricane RR 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach announcement of the Luxury Department is a vulnerable conceptual buyer of 6 m long, which is held within the Concurrence of Elegancy in Pebble Beach.
Mercedes-Benz is going to competite with the "Green Subbrand" BMW i and will continue its electrical models under a trade mark.
At least four environmental news are expected in the next years.
