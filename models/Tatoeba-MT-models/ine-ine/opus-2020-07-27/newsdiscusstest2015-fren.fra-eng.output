UKIP residents who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those coming to the United Kingdom to make health tourism, and when, with this mind, he answers yes when the interviewer asks him specifically whether people living with HIV are included in the adverse.
You are using special arguments at the border, and then discreet them by a almost stuck homophobie.
Every time I or my family need NHS, we have to do the cup behind the intleries to the chronic hypocondry that think they're all dead.
I think that you are using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right cigs, does not exist.
I think that is what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only a UKIP parallel universe that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quotation from a torchon does not constitute evidence.
Yes, then, look at the messager.
The Mail did not write the report, he just commented it.
Those who control the majority of media in this country should be fucked for propagating such a popular propaganda as if it was reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should take care of when you're trying to kill the debate by homophobia's ambitions.
The phrase of Farage was very surprised, but only because we are talking so rarely about this problem.
He absolutely did not make any homophobe comments.
You'll have to get back to it.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I think you don't love when media talk about what you don't love.
This is so rare because contrary to Farage and his cingling disciples of Thatcher who think that AIDS and inundations are a sign of god and not a reflection on their own incapacity to understand that the complexities of mankind are something good, then not.
Finally, the situation is possible in Ireland and Spain.
With the new crisis that occurs in the externity period, nothing will be arranged.
Expecting nearly 5% growth in 2015 is a great pleasure.
Ireland the '' TIGRE OF THE EUROPE' has been advantaged, a few years ago.
We've known the sequence!
This starts reading the article again.
We are trying to believe that Ireland is a vertuous country and that a 'NOVE ECONOMIC MIRACLE' is going to happen.
With the Brussels Agreement, taxes on the lowest European society, a walk of work three floors, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients, there is no 'pavoy' for the time with the coming of the Polandians.
In the 1980s of the 20th century, Ireland was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with the Portuguese, considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is still better than it was.
Greece was forward.
That their development was not a long quiet river, it is on the view of recent events.
The lowest rate of impots in Europe?
It's fake!
Latvia has an imputation rate of 0% on businesses.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France from the policy on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If a report is believed in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France.
Only SMEs pay full power.
Now I confirm that the road traffic has become a huge return, and there are new cars (and dear) with all road corners, exactly as before the crisis of 2008.
I've lived in Dublin for 14 years, the repeat is evident in the daily bottles since the return.
Is it supposed to be of the economic current?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will be burned soon.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a crossing on A140.
Are Ryanair now accounting for transfering passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a new float of apparatus, so some boss and rays on the elders will be forgotten quickly.
That's what I'm saying I'm going to steal with him next week, so I hope that it will not be on one of these two once refined.
So that would be completely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay an addition to the passengers for the additional fear that we wanted to give them?
But without this type of Irish business, you couldn't let you go to vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the air company offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give it joy.
Any article on Ryanair starts tens of comments of people who would never take Ryanair in the place of those who love to take Ryanair and think that those who pay other than the basic tariff only have to take it to themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what will be the delays and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if that is the case, if Ryanair will be able to avoid paying, saying that it was a mistake of airport controllers.
The passengers were placed in another plane in less than one hour, and they have no right to compensate.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome to this British Airways flight that brings the ISIS in ↓a, not true, as you say.
Good travel
Last Sunday in Paris, the Frances-Burgeo Street: the Marais is largely pittonnier, and greetate literally worldwide.
People do not come in mass for the quality of restaurants (as for most of them) or for the Salon of the magazine to the Space of Blas-Manteaux (hyper-intelligent and roughly dustful).
The reason for this crowd is that the magazines are all open and that the quarter is incroy's live and animated.
I have many foreigners who spent .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the bottles are opened on Sunday, bound from the world with 50% of tourists.
@aloes False!
The only argument that would appear to me is that of the areas that receive a significant number of foreign tourists and it is noted by the fact that they buy in decade.
Tourist areas lose a significant volume of business numbers each year for the same reasons .
The industry remains where costful equipment, exploited on Sunday, allows prices to be decreased.
The dominical rest is a right which is beneficial, except exclusively, for the salaries.
That is why it is planned and regulated by the Work Code.
Neither the Minister of Economy, nor the Minister of Foreign Affairs, has the least competence to reform the work code.
While they're bucking it.
What does this law use?
It satisfies a part of the population and companies who want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday, I bring my little children to the municipal library.
In my town of 30000 people where I lived in France, the municipal biblio is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is the access to culture...
And this is also the regulation of worktime.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism

What if the success of his daughter was, against his will, used to pay the costs of success?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
Of course, his success would like his part of the shot, if you're talking to me.
its preference for a victory of nationalists/France in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas in their enemy, and also hate his well-known hatred of the sights.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
I don't even.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940, he held head to the other arists of the government who wanted to discuss a "contract" with the Nazis, and he won very deeply.
Thanks to his wonderful retoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and France, and the Ethiopian, and, finally, the whole world, can thank God for having been in these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
The size of Churchill has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to collect the money for the costs of succession, they could even make a benefit.
If the public wants to be able to add one in a museum, they collect money to buy it.
It's so simple as that.
But we could use the money of taxes.
No one can deny that, when it was “the time of truth, Churchill’s personality was a positive benefit for his country during the Second World War.
A recovery of the internal market by public travels will only contribute to large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding immobilization, and infrastructure chains are not renewable.
As regards the social reforms of the Minister, they are well reflecting the real fragile mistakes:s failure towards the dialogue
Return to primary values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Or we are solemnly approaching its aid, or he has DROIT in exchange of services that he makes or has made to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to the smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the wallet that lives income of his properties.
It is necessary to distinguish the investor for a return at the time of his retirement and the person who lives from his rents.
A good to praise and even two for a couple above, it's ↓
The small genius of the Finance is unlikely missing imagination.
The new deal was a policy of big jobs, but at a time of deficiency in large infrastructures.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are safeguarded.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, therefore, in nothing a new deal may be a solution.
In particular, at a time when the issue of decrease is addressed to a recession that is only a brutal wild decrease
You would have been right 30 years ago: more needed (or options) bargage, carbon mines, autoways...
But if we want to reduce the future climate-energy choc, then the need for investment is crucial: isolation, renewal of the railway network, urban transport, transport and energy storage, etc....
A taxation that promotes high income and rental.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a galopin.
Samsung's benefits are affected by iPhone 6 and its competitors in the same range
The mid-September introduction by AppleTM of larger rains for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced purchasers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for profit.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft placed this philosophy, we met a decade of stagnation that finally was broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
Moreover, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I have the tendency to buy Apple, because I love their subjacent philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach any value to the design, for them options, functionality and prize.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "better platform".
Is there "better car manufacturer", not really, they are different but similar.
I would like to see a flowing mobile industry with radially different approaches for people and different markets.
It's healthier and needs to be encouraged.
That's what we are interested in all.
I'm glad you've found exactly what you're looking for and that it's not a Apple product, even if I've made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our Umpfrontist friends who are one of them fighting the ideas and not men (in contrast, on Paris bobs ) could tell us what authors they fight the ideas of the kind and indicate us the books they hear just fighting.
Or are they just attacking the kind described in the Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is their sources Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
All right, John, I love you well, and you're someone intellective and cultivated.
I said this about Judith in the vineyard of Furusato, calling Holophern, a closer one that didn't come to me (I have no minds).
Otherwise, in the "fond", since you return there, this subject doesn't care about me, and truly I don't see where the problem is: I hope you and your friends could get out of my arrival, because I'm slow but I understand well...

Who's afraid to ask the world?
But what are we afraid of those fearing?
Furasato and @ give us answers.
The first by calling Judith of the Bible, the second by qualifying Judith Butler of a very symbolic tranchant of greenhouse.
We see how much these studies affect the most intimately among them.
We are no longer in the idea debate.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read , John , that the World has made an article on the need for theology?
@: As regards a debate of idea, I thought he had to go to sources.
Pretending to fight ideas from the only exhibition that make their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Genre Theory or X Lacroix, theologian ) does not make me very hard.
But well, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it is all the difference between having a clear opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure that he understands the nunce.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic tranchant of gorge, I enjoyed "The Second Sex" (this was more than my time) which I believe the source of "the source" of Lo's wills.
While I looked at the ́lipse since Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon was shortly shown when the clouds were opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had his charm and had a little disappointment of having sometimes the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here in the FNQ.
Yes, the cloud of the last night would really include the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a time.
Special moon flash.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our injust budget, we will give him his true colour as soon as possible.
It's obsessed you, isn't it?
I was in Melbourne, then naturally, I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also succeeded to cover the whole week of Perseid's rain and for almost all important astronomical phenomena in these recent years.
I start thinking that there is a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from heaven.
Melbourne is really not the best place for a observer, even if things are greatly improved from the other side of the Cordillère.
There were periods between 10 and 20 minutes when I couldn't see the episode because of clouds over the village of Melbourne.
I'll put a TAXE on this ́lipse.
QUICONQUE looks at this episode should pay a TAXE.
I guess your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just as the last time before you sleep.
Who or what will obsess you when he will end by disappearing?
It is a long time to read discussions by seeking messages in which people criticize the Government of Abbott and then accuse EUX to be obsessed.
Great photo of the moon above the Harbour Bri of Sydney.
It seems Mars's going to go into existence with the Earth!

However, he seems to follow the examples.
The reform of the notors would generate an application for compensation for the order of EUR 8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy claims that these applications for compensation are not based.
What if the Ministry of Economy was mistaken?
Will the decisions who have increased the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of the notors have the same courage in presenting the facture to the state budget?
The afternoon in his time.
Okay, thank you, JYL...
@lol No State is not comparable to households in relation to the management of its budget because the timezone of the State is theoretically finished while the household is born by its members' life.
Furthermore, unless the costs are unproductive, these contribute to financing material and immaterial investments from the growth of the morning and therefore future income.
Some response elements.
A regretable decision.
But remember Hippocrate's sacred swear: the health of the benefits of the world pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first.
The nice theory of the complot.
Unfortunately, the truth doesn't match your fantasm.
The medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands associated with the law such as policy.
It is the same as for the product that causes medical aborts rather than to have risky surgery interventions, safe shoot rooms for toxicomanes instead of having them in the streets, etc.
The politicians want to please the inculcated mass on these issues.
In fact, doctors don't win money with medicines.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't win money with medicines See the Liberales want our health system to be nothing to the United States, you should know how it works.
Everywhere in the world the doctors are broken in the same way, but it is more or less.
It may have been wrong to put the mistakes on toubbs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the benefits of companies and to the "seeking".
Read therefore the few rare reports on our expenditure of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare world prices of medicines present everywhere, as well as the different references from one country to another on what is being sold freely or only on order.
This strengthens it is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing on marijuana inhalations against the oncological pains, despite laws that are too disturbing them and the necessary honourable permissions.
Although the manufacturers of some medicines may not be happy to use alternatives such as marijuana, those who come to a version that offers good quality products to known doses will benefit largely.
I'm sorry to tell you lady but you're missing, there's a lot of things happening in the couchs for doctors and pharmacists.
As regards this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone puts the puzzle in the ear of a responsible for this hospital.

If researchers in social scientists were making research instead of making policies and networking, they could be used to use their "travels".
A researcher doesn't compare one fact to another.
Compare isn't looking for.
Compare is to make pedagogy no research.
It is not possible to say "the search is possible to apply it" and then in the same jet "the needs to be experienced at all.
If your research is successful, why do you experience?
If your search is not successful, why do you ask you to apply them?
Can you explain how a "seeker" can deduce that a person who cannot axilate only mathematics could easierly axle matematics and other materials?
The news allows us to learn under the condition that the people learn to use news, but how would they reach the news if they don't know?
Pisa tests are only a indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfied.
What does it use to build an indicator that informs you of what you are doing, a will of autopromotion, a troop?
Only one track to train teachers: to remove sophists and idealists from training and to teach practicers.
Fabric refers to the paragraph on stages (which is not very argumented) and you will see that your conclusion moves us to the most ineffective conservatism: "This is a device that leads to the reproduction of the practices that are in force, and that does not allow the system to progress. "
With regard to the general consensus on the status of the French system, only practicers can be taught the practices , even if they have their place in a modern training of teachers
Education theories must not have any place.
The practicians must have one.
Would you like to be worked by a chirurg whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never put his feet in a operational block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of educational problems.
Giving more weight to education theories would destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally furious: if I don't like to be worked by a practice who has only a theoretical training, I would like to make it less than to work by a chirurg who has no theoretical training and has learned about the taste.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative Deputy, charged for the fight against the violation of the copyright by David Cameron

Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmayers thank you.
If one day I start feeling guilty of violation of the copyright, I will have to read a article like this.
In an economy of information, the violation of the copyright = vol.
That is the same thing because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, a license costs nothing.
No, it's a violation of the copyright.
Not all the same thing.
By using content without a suitable license, you are free of the artists of their win-pain.
You can always discuss pedatory hypotheses - but it's a flight.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't be true.
It's a violation of the copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.

It seems that it doesn't affect you from denying artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in oil duties, a nearly perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am pleased to dismiss them from this fictional income.
Lection No. 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and put it on their preferred social networks, they leave any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions they have passed by a click.
Maybe if they share the listeners of their mp3 baller with a friend in the school bus, they should be exhausted for violating the law in such a way.
Oh, if we could export this resource that we are regreting, the laugher that says that everything's wrong....
If it is a PS member who confirms it, then we must believe it.
I have two children and when they are old to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing changed from here.
France draws people down by continually assisting them.
I don't want my children to support the debt that this policy will be created.
What turns France down is the talks like yours.
@gus I've been working in private business forever.
I had the chance of working in companies managed by excellent business leaders: this is in France but it is rare.
I'm payable because I know I don't have the powers to drive a company and this choice allows me to take red bullets on the zero patterns that I often meet.
In my baskets, I totally share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he says the terrible truth!
@gus, if we are compared to German companies that the French business leaders quote continually to ask for reforms in France, companies in Germany have been structuring their industrial weight to make it competitive, especially by providing the link between large companies and small and big companies - what are the French patrons expecting to do so?
That the State holds their hands?
This State they accusate of imperity?
@Jacques L.
Always this anti-governmental pair from you!
Remember me, what you created as a job, as a value , to be even severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is confronted with an insolvent problem: the incompatibleness of the French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who buy and threaten while waiting for the State's permanent assistance!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Work Code, patronal charges, taxes, work 45 hours/sume payed 35, and some, walking on eggs, are going to claim the decrease of the salaries other than their deletion!
I'm quick to see all the "negative" comments on this subject.
What is ironic, seeing how people always complain about the First Group.
As I see from where I am, Last wasn't really a investment for our contributors.
They tried to keep on the floor instead of transforming themselves.
This doesn't mean that Scotland railways haven't been improved since Last is busy.
But they were also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we don't have the power to do this.
I tried to have recently, but I didn't.
But well, the Labour's gonna take us out of anxiety, isn't it...
It's a international branch.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom to create a more moral undertaking and to participate in offer calls.
But it is that we are not very good in management, most of our private services end to be managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when first received the Virgin contract, all of this to finally cancel the decision.
And there is better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has received the Crossrail exploitation contract for 8 years.
Well, the Labour, as they repeated to us during the reference campaign, is totally for common settlement and sharing and thinks that all workers must enter the borders.
It may therefore be assumed that they will be pleased with this decision ;)
It may be because the Netherlands management is on good rails while the British isn't.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of owner but especially new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous system of franchise, not the franchise.
"It was a girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
To assume that the fact that being "fighting" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, intellectuality, hearing, for example, the fact that being "fighting" has nothing to do with the survival of a disease: cancer "bads", which are not less dead, I know the palanches.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with the debt.
Come on, let's start again too.
I don't tell you that it's the condition to manage, I tell you that it's AIDS.
Nothing to do with anything worth...!
When in examples of your life, there are only you to judge them.
It's a recurrence.
Insinuate, would it be only an instinct, which can be deserved to get out of a illness or that we can demand not to get out of it, it is simply monstrous.
The body follows or doesn't follow.
A body that leaves everywhere, despite the will, despite trust in the medical, you have a vague idea of what C?
I'm sorry to think the contrary, if, having a solid moral, it certainly makes it easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare it, to try experimental treatments like that woman and not to fear them.
Someone who's being medical is, first, someone who trusts the doctor.
But if we prefer to return to "Lord" it's something else.
Neither with dignity, nor with courage.
These considerations are subject to moralists.
When you catch a sauce, a real, you're deceiving to become a zombies.

I thought the accusation against Milosevic had been decided and completed a few years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "fastly" and then beared under the pipe.
Is that the story we told at the time?
The one who became nationalist who took three wars in the Balkans in the past decade?
The President of the Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we voluntaryly left on the side: 1.
How does NATO bombing be able to be able to be under the international law rule?
What country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way to go out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would have been awakened by the west compressor roller.
The O.O.A. used a smoke rubber to delay a part of a sovereign state who then unilaterally announced its independence and was emphasised by the O.A. States who later had been lying on the situation on the ground.
Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleaning).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, was politically dead after his first mandate for not to understand the situation that was developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversy figures of the political world of the time.
Finally, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic of Tyran (although we did not love it).
In my knowledge, there is only a method of predicting seisms in Greece nearby, measureing the pizoelectric level in the quarter.
This type of studies is useful and thanks for making us share the results.
A hope, therefore, is that this water has nothing to see with the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, which was about 124 years lighting of the Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which would be “the smallest and coldest planet to present detectionable water moles”, a study conducted by the Drake Deming team and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
So the method to follow.
Like those involved animals feeling a threat to come.
Thanks Passive of sciences for us, often, for these experimental proofs that are made in the world.
How would animals know (After )?
There is no doubt the perception of other elements whose rate is developed in case of seism.
Like the radon, for example.
A gas has inodorous priorities for humans but maybe decelable by animals.
All these methods are indetectable for humans, but not for the measurement instruments it has.
But we don't have reliable results on these tracks...
It has been observed once (and since centuries) that some animals have acted strangely a few hours with a seism, including the pouls, the kids, dogs, but especially fish and serpents.
I had seen a report on art relating to the fight of two scientific teams, one California, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their travels on animals to the earthly magnetic fields, and especially to their change before a seism.
So I'm not a scientist, but their hypothesis convinced me!
Or are we on these research?
Why so disappointed to this track?
We should learn again to listen to the nature...
If we examine things quietly and strictly, we have it in a serious magazine, and no one disappoints it.
As we speak of the "signs" given by the animals, we are on the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a seism the red fish turned strangely around.
I don't understand that we can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservators.
He made it too much as a major of London.
When we listen to the LBC program, we can avoid thinking that this man doesn't know anything and that he always trys to divert with a blague.
He never answers directly anyway.
He also said that he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari asked him what.
He couldn't name one point.
He did so many promises to make himself elected as a master and he did not have one.
It is not only to highlight how much the rest of the Conservator Party is just a fucking collection, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in “Have I Got News for You”.
Because it's a clebrity, and people have been inculcated to worship the célébrities.
The Londonians voted for him, and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the direction of the party, the Tories' popularity quota will cross the floor I'm sure.
Let God help us.
I am not so sure: people love blagues, but they don't want their first minister to be a
That's exactly what the Londonians said.
He had to bring his friend to parpaing with him, more intelligent than he
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as the President.

Millot, the “Solomon ” and the“ iron deterioration ” speak, so unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the people who know (one of their heavy crosseur, Australia, must always be in there since the battle of Savo) did not want to return to them.
We are actually over before the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission touchs the end.
That's the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total smoking.
Calculate the consumption of cherozen to achieve the total decredible goal of the concept.
It's enough to park the list of sponsors Like philanthropes.

I'm taking the web series with impatience!
Your recipe makes me reveal, identifiing me a little in the past (I also learned to navigate with the Crocos de L'Elorn in Moulin Bla_Ray of Brest!).
Chapter also for the message, even if some criticize the impact of the movement.
The end justifies the means.
Make us see, and proudly show that the British are big travelers!
Pierre, from Trinidad et Tobago.
Good evening I think the red good that has manifested against taxes is happy to know that this travel is sponsored by the British Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, I think that local collectivities and public agencies should not have a sum of our taxes to finance the dreams of some adventures even like those!
Is there players in the current Serbian training that originate cosovare?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, sometimes at the Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they are still in the team
It's Bisevac the defensor of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a middle of land or before in the 70s and 80s and led many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attack in the great team of Velez, which, under the guard of the Suleman Rebac, completed twice in the Yugoslavia ligue (and also counted pointures such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team of Arsene Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
We said he was going to become a big player when he was at the Juve, he was now in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar he was connected to Blackburn * frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as far as I know he's not holder there.
Maybe he can do something yet, perhaps in the Super Indian League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is that this drone's flag is not the actual Albania flag today.
It seems that it was the flag of the Great Albania, which includes all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much deceit (what I know).
In fact, it was a Albanian flag with the map not of what the Great Albania is called, but from Albania before 1913, when the large European powers decided to give the country to neighbors.
How can we have felt "a pleasure explosion" by seeing two tours shaken by knowing that women, men and children are inside?
How?
What makes me feel a little in this "teaching" is that the only fact that I could, once, would be spontaneously enjoying the horrible death of thousands of people, testifying in my eyes of a "border line" personality, whose "teachers" should be taken with the greatest circumstances.
There is no doubt in the short time of "goodness", we would not have thought about the dead or the reality of the troubled fear.
We would just have thought of an instinct, which, for a time, Muslims had succeeded to do real and apocalypticly bad to the great wicked Satan in his own heart.
To make qqch powerful.
Great.
It would be that this feeling was shared by thousands of muslims who were broken by their feeling of humbleness.
Avoid the witnesses filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We had a little doubt about it.
"Christian/blaois/gaulois" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contains the general misfortune, the social and cultural sub-development of the Arab Muslim world today.
I'm talking about Cairo or Alger, not about Dubai's tours.
The past splendid , certainly magnified, is not a comfort, rather.
How does the muslim world get out of this diabetic tongue?
Totally in phase, two major pounds irrigue the Arab world: the bigot conservatism of local powers and the fascising nihilism.
The common point, the ice of thinking and excommunication (douce or armed) of its critical expression.
What we did before, we shouldn't make the Muslims back.
That's the only way.
Has he read this article?
I guess that is true in many countries.
But in Great Britain, the autumn marks the beginning of six long-larged dark, humid and depressive months that affect the welfare and the humor of many people.
Moreover, everyone falls sick.
Sezonary depression.
I'm suffering myself.
When the light goes out, it becomes the hell for me and those like me.
A vitamin D dose should help a little for the humor and well-being.
The holiday is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign is particularly to cut the souffle in automne.
Not as much to cut the surface as the green of the sea when everything is alive instead of being at the point of covering.
In Great Britain, if you have a chance, the sea falls a weekend.
We have been a good years this year, don't make your brilliant that races of clichés!
Not everyone.
I'm rarely sick in winter.
But now I'm at the retirement and I'm no longer developing immunity to the germes outside, it can change, I guess.
It's not at the point of moving, it's just a step in a cycle...
A marvelous step filled with envying odors, with a feverity that covers with festivals such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, risks of anger and many other wonderful words.
It's enough to stop doing things!
Here's my recommendations for the festivals for you.
Yes, these dark and gris months make me really much more happy and more detained.
For the monitoring of children's increases , the amount of the State is mainly coming from deciles 8 to 10 .
However , in the case of the number of employees who have seen their tax increase by this measure , these are particularly deciles 4 and 5 which are concerned ( average income ) of Figure 2 .
The elimination of half of the widows in particular is not of all treaty in the article or its impact is completely evaluated: 230M of euros is a pleasure that does not take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013 and that it is insolent.
And it's not ready to get in.
All right, we're not on the right pair, but we're thinking.
For one time the PS does a policy instead of the left, we're not going to weep...
It is obvious that those who are part of 20% of the richest must support more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let's continue this way and you will encourage these 20% less to work or to go.
Well, I know, that's not politically correct, but I'm still saying it.
Live the Trots and the OCI recycled to the PS: they all understand.
Adam, you see what you're looking wrong.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population have 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when he prohibits anyone to pay as much as he can.
Besides a certain limit, money loses all its use.
And once over the profit of money, money is only to do money, it is ) to make the worst of the greatest number.
We are part of the 20% of the richest.
There is no doubt also 20% of homes who work most (and create riches which are logically re-distributed).
A equitable tax must allow these homes to benefit from a part of their efforts.
Or so low your arms and live social minimums, especially if we have a social apartment .
The Utopies of the Red Khmer's head-coppers are lucky.
I made two AirBnB in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to present us at the receipt or to face at least tracks.
It's enough to go to someone, sleep there, strike back and leave.
Before it'll be my first option when I'm on my journey.
The logo changed, people...
Check your assurance before praising your house.
In most cases, you will need a type of owner's assurance.
Make sure to use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risked" No, it's not true.
You just missed real happiness.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, the response of Airbnb to Theman was quickly, almost absurdly quick.
In 24 hours, after a e-mail delivered to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb sent a lock to change the locks, took provisions to pass a week to the hotel and transferred $23 817 (for which Airbnb is assured, but at the same time).
So why does this article quote Theman complaining that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I AD AIRBNB, to get as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to assure me.
I'm going to pay an account and a month to spend a time but I'm a little afraid to send 1 600 £ to a site I never really heard.
But where are we going?
“ Support the troops, ” the Bu$herie sang on all the tons...
So inoffensive arms.
I am sure that this will please families and nearly thousands of dead courses in halabja to learn that their parents and friends have been involved in something else than in the chemical bombing of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the contents of the article has been radically held by the author, your comment is inadequate (to remain poly).
In addition, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons covered nearly 20 years later were still useful?
It is not hyper; it is not the author's own: "for the search of massive destruction arms.
We're all right.
You believe it's time to weak the army to strengthen education
It is never time to strengthen education, because we are still in war.
Alternative: Is it the time to strengthen education, because we are still in war?
Instead of 17 hours, the education would have been much strengthened if "thes" were working 35 hours.
At the time, our teachers currently win more than engineers.
And we don't believe that teachers spent 18 hours a week to prepare their program.
But this does not seem because the National Education does not have the means to provide a office to his professionals, so they are living with them.
A type of telework forced in sum, unless the employer pays neither the computer, nor the Internet connection, nor the supply.
Moreover, it's the plan at 17 hours a week and 4 months of vacation that we don't come to fill the CAPES of maths, come on, wait for you.
How do you not want to bullshit wrong-educated clears whose parents crack you by training you as a chairman?
I think the priority in this area is to disarma the dejaadites so that the people of the Khurd can improve.
Where it is seen that Bush's administration has absolutely all done through.
My first diplomatic job was in the sale, in London, to win three times nothing and yet it was a job for which a diploma needed.
A year later, I saw an announcement for the London Metro, it was paid more than 5000 pounds per year and it was not even asked for the patent.
I've never regreted.
In this regard, don't worry if you don't find a diplomatic job, try to find something that pays good, or you like to do.
If I had stayed in diplomatic jobs, I would still pay my student's loan.
I don't like the business work so much, so I hope that I go to the end either in the function or in the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article comes really late!
Exactly, when I received my diploma in 2011, there was already a three-year-old arrival.
The best way to reduce the number of diplomats without employment?
Avoid bisounds such as art / letters / theater / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is what the students are called unemployment diplomas.
I've got one of these diplomas and I've completed the manufacturing director.
It appeared that the importance was not the diploma, but, as the above article said, a good professional partner, starting with the oil and the whole university.
Certainly, the outcome salary was lower, but the scales are quickly ascending because in the real world the results are more than knowledge.
This debate of engineer studies/artist branches has been held for years.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to rise up the morning, to come to work at time and to interact with people in a way that results.
Letters, philosophers and arts are bisunors?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about diplomas type of media study or whatever the abscond branch where you've gone.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and arts are real branches.
We need people who can explain the major issues to the students, who understand the importance of cultural bases such as literature, art, etc., and value them.
Wouldn't it be better a real territorial policy to disengorise Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I feel bad for the people of the end of Essonne and Val-d'Oise to make 80 km back every day to come to work in Paris.
Inside-muros and small cisterns have already many other practical means of transport in common (metro, bus, tramway).
> Secure and closed parks, as already exists in the cities of North Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the sure.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalised by the 2RM.
In fact, it is expected that the town of Paris works with professionals in the Netherlands and Denmark.
The same benefit of their great experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found any place for UN SEUL driving machines.
The motivation is stronger when it is to find a office for Bertrand Delanoye....
Well, it's not all right.
When talking to pittons and other users of transport in common, why they do not pedal, I think that the main reasons are: 1/ is hyper dangerous with all these bathrooms, these trucks, these shooters who run super rapidly and get out of the survival of the cars 2/ I have to take full of pollution in my head, the cyclable tracks are to go, you need to reduce the car ability (type urban congestion sword), to reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), to comply with the road code systematicly (such the wheels in the benmol before you need to adjust the road code written for bagnoles 100 years ago), to generalise the buffer areas after closed passages, not before the bathroom, and not to be shooted.
The cyclable tracks are the apartheid, you need to cohabit but reequilibrate the occupation of the city space.
Nothing on the wheel in the Great Paris?
Isn't there a word on the place of the veal in common transports?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% of fast movements is ridiculous.
I'm starting to believe that Anne Hidalgo's rolled the green in the fat.
In addition to learning what the OR relates, EELV adjoints have skeptics.
I prefer to be optimist.
Before the racket starts, it would better find who really hides behind this massacre.
Index: This is not Russia.
Not sure to love the way the world develops.
It looks horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the CEDH, but I did not hear that a complaint was actually deposited.
Moreover, they should make a complaint in Germany or Ukraine.
I also appreciate that these matters will be rejected while waiting for the result of the investigation report on the ae and the investigation that would be acquired.
Yes, but Libya did not explode Pan Am 103 too.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault is responsible to the airspace security authority, in that case the Ukrainian government.
Did he have it before?
Other aircrafts have been scattered, Ukraine was launched in the area of air attacks against rebellion, and any aircraft could, of course, be considered as a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian Government taken reasonable precautions in view of a clear threat or has he chosen to play with the lives of innocents in order to pay overflow rights from the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their Government/West Ukrainian ultranationalists - and want to demonstrate greatly that Poutine has killed the MH17 flight.
As I know, there is already a complaint against the Government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their heavens.
It is: a decision of 1986 of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the delivery of arms by the Contrate forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States were responsible for their actions.
No chance that Russia leaves this case to the CIJ.
It is fun to think Abbott means to Poutine that some people have been supported by Russia's rebellion.
I hope that he can present evidence to deal with his claims.
Until the investigators said nothing about this.
You're called Ricardo and being such a beotic in eco, it's disappointing!
Calling Polar is losing the north is rejoicing.
One question of the Beothy: Is the poor today poorer than the poor yesterday?
I can't be able to note that those who criticize the Piketty book most virtually did not read it!
It's easy to read, I've put a few days.
It shows the statistical development of income-production, capital income, inequality-concentration, inequality of income, capital property, debt and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of today's capital approaches the beginning of the 20th before 1914, shows that the two world wars have decreased the capital concentration, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration represents after...
Bernajuzan: You say no matter what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pave, knowing that the ability to concentrate a person has some limits.
Then the question is not to know whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central tess given by the press is just or not.
If it is fair, it can be discussed without reading the book which is essential to argument in a single sense for it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did you have to read it?
Is the central tess of his pave summarized by the press false?
I didn't read and I wouldn't read it.
So I'm in the summary of his central tess, and that's the one that looks like a pure fum.
The concept of rich and poor art is subsidiary.
Didn't mankind be globally rich?
And this increasing increasing population is the true political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is a impressive personality and deserves the price without doubt.
But remember that she's just 17 years old.
Age in which most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope that this price will not be a burden for the young girl and she will find her way to live a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of the ODA governments who want to prove the old adjage, which is the incarnation of the evil.
All my vows of happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or else - even in the popular quarters of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn't there where she was now, she would have been married at 14 years.
Malala itself doesn't be part of these "pervers colored"?
You should not have any "antenna time" on this site.
You're a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't worth the marriage at 14 years.
She was 15 years old when we shot her.
His father leads a school where girls are schooled and he is for the equal rights of women.
It is, and has always been, so that she can receive a higher education and have the right to decide herself about her marriage.
However, it's someone inhabitable in Pakistan, as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she said is that a average Pakistanian girl should often marry at 14 years without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it quite pleasant for you.
This can be contradiction, but maybe she wants to say that if her father hadn't given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years
Instead of disappointed by this input in the 4th season and especially by Jessica Lange, who has a little difficult to find her society personality of Marlene Dietrich.
I just looked at the last two samples that are quite different but I must admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most awesome!
A first fascinating episode.
The performance is close to the perfection and the Jessica Lange show sing anachronic Life on Mars de Bowie is simply reversing.
I have not yet seen this new season (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I prefer to have any time than looking at 13 stationed episodes on 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is sure, outside Jessica Lange's extraordinary, is especially the risks of scenes and mountings that have sent me.
In AHS, there is an avalanch of original plans that do not hurt the appetite of today's production.
It's a little bit out of me to see you throw the eponge in front for the next season without even waiting for the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things yet.
It is not just for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is actually UN of the series piliers outside technical qualities.
And good bah, I'm looking very much for her.
Then I find that the series is in writing, she wants too much to do things at the same time.
The 3th season was below, in 2 was too dispersed despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 samples of American Horror Story or it's gonna end as 24 hours old what.
But everyone does what he wants!
That's why I say, "I will not look again" than everyone has to do the same!
I just share my view of nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal to her.
But then, here, that's just my opinion.
Let's speak less of tax increases, please - let's rather cover the State's expenditure.
No, let's increase the expenditure, please.
Those who wanted to get out of the expenditure failed.
Launch polyemics on relatively small expenditure posts, such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the error margin in the United Kingdom expenditure of the Government.
The truth is that we all are talking about nuances rather than about the change of orientation that the electors call for their vows and all this time some in each camp seem to be much more important and substantive than they are - and the electors see it in their game and find them bad faith.
Less than 1 % of expenditure.
The debt is assets mainly detained by financial institutions in this country.
The debt is nothing that it fails to worry.
I would not see any problem with the government's adjustment to one third of my income (before even talking about consumption taxes) if I thought he was going to use it with a good science.
But this is not the case, and many contributors have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been fairly honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, the development aid, High Speed 2, subventions to nearly unusual eols and nuclear centres that cost the double of what they should, you reach a number that seems goodly ridiculous to the Labor and Lib-Dem tax on the most luxeful residences.
Your first 10 000 £ are not impossible.
This means that someone who wins 35,000 £ per year pays about 5,000 £ (a seventh of their salary), someone with 50,000 £ would pay about 10,000 £ (a fifth), etc., and someone with 200,000 £ paid about 70,000 £ (a little more than one third).
What about social contributions?
More social contributions, more local taxes, more stationing costs and car vignette, and it is before the VAT.
Almost 30% of my money is taken to the source before local taxes and car vignette.
I'm decently paid, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm glad to pay my taxes.
But let's not believe that money falls from heaven, or that it is not important to know where billions of books of taxes pass.
How can an unemployed who seeks work at the gateway prove it?
Even though 20% of the unemployed wouldn't be looking for, that means 80% searching and not finding.
As I'm unemployed, do I have more interest in what the others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CV, it increases my chances of so much.
Actually, I haven't had news of Pole Employ for months, that means that agents are more busy in control operations than actually making job announcements?
I don't see the interest.
Because it is not to the State to provide work.
If Poli Employment doesn't provide enough posts, then you need to go to Pole Emploi.
What is this about a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in fact, we are sure that unemployed ones are well fulfilling their duties in contrast to their rights.
As a controller requests their transport title to the users by means of transport, a service manager or the salaries of their work, etc.
Nobody's crying to the scandal in these cases, right?
It is really good to remember that the unemployed are rights: the only two times I had a business in Pole Employ, my rights to the ARE have been wrongly established, and on one of the cases, 40% amputated, it was necessary to fight close.
That takes time!
I'm not expert in the right.
Figure and control takes the top of the current time, while Poli Employment is legally near to be, in fact, an insurance company.
I would like that the subject of compensation should only be concerned by salaries, these are those who pay the costs.
Politicals and non-salariated French have rights that they do not have!
It's not normal.
I would like to have an worthless unemployment insurance involved in the evaluation of the payable work.
More than waiting for arabic Twitters...
In fact, there is a direct military response in Iraq / ↓e that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict area.
The situation would then lead to the spread of black pestilence in 1348/9 in relation to war and movement of populations at the time.
The Saudians had the spirit to prohibit Hadj this year to the Mexican Muslim Persians coming from three affected countries.
The Country reports that 7 400 have seen their request for visa due to their country of origin or their recent travels.
In fact, there was the case of a perlerine coming from Bosnia who contracted the variol in Mexico during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a peerry coming from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same mind.
Does it be unhearted to propose to prevent Ebola’s sick people from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was a simple good sense, but apparently those who know decided that we could risk life of saying thousands of people...
These Western African countries where Ebola is out of control should be put in 40 strict.
No one's lucky.
Only health staff can enter.
21 days after treatment of patients before they can go.
If they contract Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are healed.
These are not draconical measures.
Nothing but last week, people have been contaminated after having contacted people in Western Africa, though they have taken "all the necessary precautions".
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It is mainly spread by air companies.
Let's prohibit them to offer flight to these countries.
Moreover, the customs officers in the airport should be trained to find people with the typical symptoms of Ebola, so that they may be put on the basis of quaranta.
Let it come to pass the message of the first individual and the group (including religious) second and he will have deserved the Nobel of Peace.
I doubt it is able to enrich the image of God in dogma characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It's still far from this design there.
This only 20 years ago that information appeared as the first given of mankind, while religion, out of the brain, leads our actions since Lucy maybe.
What is the interest of become a first protestant church?
For those who have not noticed that Catholicism is largely minor in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not put the feet in the Church anyway, but there is only a few protestants in France.
What is the next step, the concept of sin, too "angiogenic"?
@louise: I'm sorry the church has no restricted vision to France.
And in the world, maybe this will allow to touch more of the world...
@Martine E, to be honest (as a habit) the respect of others as you intended to exist in the Christ.
Hillel a century ago said to him: "Do not do what you don't want to do to you, it's all the Torah and the rest is just a comment: go and study!"
Christianity is far beyond a simple reciprocity but introduced the agape.
Do you "build justice, peace, brotherhood" but without gods?
Is it a return to communism?
Proc is a step: the incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain that hero who violated the moral laws by redefiniting the respect of others.
Christians will then be willing to play their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to promote justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of protestants in France is mostly explained by the fact that their forefathers were destroyed and became forced and moved to immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm getting too much between buying this, the new alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game quickly goes out.
It doesn't make it.
I'd personally choose SoM.
I love Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its funding campaign) but I don't think that it is 30 £.
If this is the PC version that you are interested, Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM to 30 £ and also offers a 20% reduction property.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM to 30 £ and also offers a 20% reduction.
I'll look at it.
Obviously not at work.
The rejoicing of the computer department blocks all sympa sites.
Hello, is it 30 £ and 20 % of reduction, or is it 30 £ of reduction 20 %?
However, warning: PC version is only for DX11.
I was surprised, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Moreover, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's no.
It's time to buy a new video card * makes the goal*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam identifier, I think.
Caveat emptor and all this: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon 30 £ for PC, 35 £ for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 £ for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that one day they would make it out of your library if they decided to seize people who bought it there while they were out of the planned region.
So please join the beta version of Elite : Dangerous.
So, was France in 1940 a "master land"?
So say, that Nobel price seems to me to be a good gift.
You need to love France of 40, "the strange defect"?
When you see who gets the literature Nobel, you wonder if Proust or Dostoijevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even a event, we do not even want to read the first authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Others will read Modiano who is already hardly readable in French and who describes a so limited and egocentric universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more reliable, but I doubt honestly.
Modiano, Levy, Musso has only a remote report with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel price?
It would be better to judge.
As regards Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to literature and French culture, they.
They will be able to appreciate Mr.
Modiano at his right value, if they don't know it anymore!
On your side, continue to frequency Lévy and Musso.
I'll share your opinion.
Mark Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let's see who received the Nobel of literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hello the horribles.
Since I conducted an Iceland, I don't stop seeing Kia Sportages everywhere.
I think this thing followed me up here.
Maybe she wants to hit me?
Or get me like Superman III's horrible dealer?
Hello, Dantra, always hate?
Hello, DQ - no, not today, I took my doctors.
It's Thursday!
I had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last week, I went to the Beer and Nottingham's cedar.
It was border.
I got 19 different beer, Wobbly Weasel is one of my favorites.
I was approved by the mixing of people there, there were only CAMRA fanatics (not confusing with the camera fanatics).
To drive back on Sunday, it was really hard.
On Monday evening we went with a friend's grandfather to play nine brag cards.
Thanks to a real chance of starting, I could share with several decent places.
I hope if I get 95 years old, I'll be as alive as he.
I went to a little cocktail bar in Farringdon last night.
One of my drinks arrived with a trance of larry over.
I admire M.
Read a little Bouddha and you will understand how much you're wrong, dear Christian.
I think you're going to get a little away from the subject.
This totality, it prohibits the search for the deads at the outcome of the mosques.
She signals the weapons traffic.
Or we have large open eyes like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker, whether we have large eyes closed.
You have to choose.
It's not by keeping the closed eyes to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental contrast: all of the authorities, organizations or representatives, muslims or not, who have formally condemned the EI and its crimes, the French, the Muslims, or not, have nothing to do with these official convictions.
Who doesn't say a word.
The problem is that people like you seem to be as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, the doubt exists for everyone.
As I said thousand times, some doubt about the approval of the Jews of the Israelites' massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and insensitive to accuse them before and demand them to demonstrate to prove the rest of the French society that it has wrong to do.
This principle is in my eyes the refusal of the Republic and can only contribute to delivering the French society.
If there's no doubt, so much to say.
Who doesn't say word, but what?
Consent to a closeness with EI or the condemnation of EI.
Silence is well practical, it's the main army of those who want to breathe cheese and choice.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically intentional.
Alex Salmond foretold that in the elections, the Ecosse could "search" from the parties represented in Westminster because a huge fooled was buried between their proposals of decentralisation and what they promised to watch the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petridged in the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must smile.
What are these threats?
The Conservators are completely deceived by the Ecosse since they have no seat.
They can do what they want in any electoral impunity.
I don't think that even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labor per _BAR_ seats in Westminster to benefit the SNP or a good thing long-term for him and the Conservators.
Who's going to pay an army for the Worklist Party.
They will completely remove themselves in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their head into the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "Promesse" thinking that he saved his party but without realizing that he signed the dead stop of his Swiss members' death.
It is not surprising that some worklist members ask their manager accounts.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in Parliament, even if the seats are not from Conservators, they will be in very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservators and the Labor to do what they promised for a maximum decentralisation.
I think that's important.
Not if the Labor or the Conservators want to be re-employed on a day on earth.
It is not a super electoral strategy to cite 8% pumps at 85% detriment.
Furthermore, since the Swiss Members will no longer vote on the subjects relating to England, the Conservators will win all votes.
Oh, I think he's.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists, and that succeeded him.
However, he is still in school to be the Prime Minister in 2015 and since he has received the direction of the Worklist Party.
So, largely, these boxes will be behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he read, how he read, and until the end.
This is "The Life of the Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the FRIC world...
The same fascination for monitoring techniques.
At the end, this will at least have a sterilising effect.
I'm attracting the next ticket: Amazon makes your free free dependent on your profile and it automatically using a secret algorithm!

Very stimulant.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, I am still reading pirated files, books from the public domain or buying with some editors who have the intelligence of offering without mouchard files.
Because of the price I paid to Kobo, it's unfortunate.
I am aware of the generalized accusation of users with regard to the generalized asset of their private life.
In your large public library, you will systematicly note that everyone gives his card of loyalty (f*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also required work leaders whose opening and finishing rates are no doubt deficiencies.
For example, “Finigans Wake ” from James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the Earth of the Big Data, data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Attention to not put the entire literature into the same.
Anonymous data collection when a profile exists....
The collection is not anonymous.
These are the data provided by Kobo which are it, not allowing or identifiing the players, nor the authors.
But Kobo has all that information, he.
There have been so many exagered, wrong and contradictive statements from the Turkish Government in the last days that the country has been conducted by a class of mothers full of acid-based shizophrenes.
It is still worse than if you take into account the religious religionism of Erdogan.
It is interesting that some partisans of Erdogan think is an islamist such an insult that they submit your comment, but not my. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to get a ball in the foot, unless you win something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will ripost, so it is actually to cut a ball into the feet.
A draft diplomate written on his blog: "The AP reports that Iran has observed the United States that it would be a mistake to reverse the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad's law because it would threaten Israel's security.
It is not in the article if Iran sent a serious warning of reprises or if he simply advised the idea.
This second option is greater and, in all cases, it really surprises that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment relates to Israel and the security of the region."
Reading of Indian Punchline is highly recommending to anyone who takes attention to details rather than to the C*Narries balanced by traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read by keeping mind the realistic / warnings coming from Iran about Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderous" who are seriously fighting the horrible Laic Assad and at the same time the pervers of IIS?
The pipelines policy moves the world to the abime and I would suggest to those who refer to “moderous ” inexistents to make more attention to facts and alternatives before sending children of others to the Third World War.
"It is still worse than this if you take into account the religiousism of Erdogan" are there other religious religionists in the Middle East?
I've got a head of it.
It would have to be a process of Nuremberg for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should he "be"?
Do you realize that neither the victims nor the victims have the least chance to be alive yet?
A little late for that, my friend...
Shouldn't they be almost old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, isn't it?
Especially regarding the CUP triumphant that planned and managed the genocide, Talât and Djemaal killed just after the First World War by vengeance by the Armenians, and sending killed by the Bolcheviks in a poumed place of Central Asia nearly at the same time, when there was a dream of establishing a Turkish empire.
What a deliver!
A impressive control of the sophism of the fatal penal, but otherwise, we are looking for the real.
It's no argument.
The foetus will always hear a heart that hits even in the womb of a portrayal mother.
The lesbian couples may simply be a child's desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Stereal heat couples also.
What about the kids!
What a shame to design them as future psychological unbalanced.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to win their lives and to pay the retirement of this lady (?)
The GPA is, of course, a temporary "resolution" in the development of the medical developments that we know.
She doesn't give up today.
Many women brought and placed in the world of children who were not their husband.
It's still like this, we've been doing this...
The important thing in this matter is that this practice should be enhanced in order to limit the "marketing" of the body.
But the isthetic surgery, the cosmetics are not also the goods of the body? !
Anacronic Fair Unit...
It is certainly more legitimate to increase a good in remote country via the Internet and Pay Pal than to acquire its responsibility and to avoid scandal in another centuries close to himself without calling it at this time on all the toets! ...
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church ! ...
There are only Christians and believers who do these practices...
There is not less than the exploitation of the body is a real problem.
Oh, calm down, this guy's suffering of something.
At the end of the 70s in the Midlands, I just saw this far away.

But if you love this and listen to music - this music today it always touchs you so much.
I don't know why there are so many disappointing comments on what Paul Mason says, maybe they are put by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sport section there is a article on the foot waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's movie, there is a penalty of reports that really reflect the reality of North England's culture.
No wonder that Paul Mason has made the social and political context well, he understands things well.
The Northern soul lives still, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today is essentially a surface phenomena.
This means, you can cast an ear there if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul will go back to the wine, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here's a small article well written and well thought.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're happy to have gone in Newsnight.
Last train for Wigan de Victoria/Exchange and down to Wallgate.
Getting pills.
Whatever the garage before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes from Wigan after buying a ticket for the arrest after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern soul are described in an excellent episode of the police series George Gently, named Gently Northern Soul, which was held in Newcastle in 1968.
The cases become more empowerable.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never rates a chance to break a chance to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou doesn't seek peace because he wants to keep busy-colonising (in addition, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahou and their electors prefered peace-colonization.
He took his clothes, put them on the rock and entered the water.
A Israelite had stolen them to him.
The Israeli representative arose in anger and cried: "What are you talking about?
The Israelites were not even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (ONU) supports and ↓a: and now that things are established
Israel and the majority of his people have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not decrease the guard...
That this depleases the anti-Israelians is a evidence, that is not the purpose searched ...
Antisionist: But I answered you, I translated: World Geopolitical Report ...
And it's still so since the Policy is globalized...
Evite, avoid...
In Israel-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certainly losing!
For the creation of Israel, you do not answer.
What power report has allowed Israel to create?
Antisionist: Israel-Palestinian conflict is still a power report!
You're doubting?
Furthermore, it does not just turn around the Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have difficulty to go beyond anything he had not to say.
Many of what he says are only pseudo-chomskyst billets written without others.
This proves that you don't understand what Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It is just a sequence of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter, which would mean that it is an issue of immorality).
A very vicious burden, with just a suspicion of assumption that Brand says certain truths, perhaps the truths to which we prefer not to think.
Get closer, this feeling will be more expansive!
I can understand why Brand horribles some: he sometimes speaks pretextually and after all absurdities of tabloids, he actually gives the impression of being a starting popularist, but all this story of not voting has been completely wrongly interpreted after me.
The general consensus is that he only says to people not vote and rather cross the arms and ignore all the political process - but if you look at Paxman's and other articles/videos he posted, he says that to vote once every 5 years only for the Labor or Conservators (or the Lib Dems I assume) and limit the democratic commitment to it is completely unnecessary, the two parties (at different degrees) governing essentially for special interests, multinational and rich companies, at no time he says that they simply ignore the policy simply because these parties do not rule in our name: he insists that they should say that they are just voting and disconnected for five years, people should become much more active of political and political effort to avoid political efficiency.
I do not say that I am necessarily agreed with his solution (for I think that being active politically by presenting his requests can go to the vote, since the politicians are a turnover that will change their opinion if they really can lose the elections), but it is rare to see all these consequent answers that say that this stupid one that makes Jesus said to youths not take the penalty to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it is really deforming his arguments.
His solution is extremely debatable and it would be good if people discussed what he actually said rather than simply label it as unresponsible and put the concerns of him and a lot of people left for account.
Yeah, thank you.
The matter on the vote has been completely deformed.
The unnecessaryness of dragging a bulletin into a urn every five years deeply disappoints me because my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic vote, direct democracy and Members who are able to take account locally before their electors.
In addition, I contest the idea that the speech of Brand is not its (written by others).
It is quite intelligent to have his own words and ideas, even if these are strongly influenced by the type of thoughts and anti-establishing universities from the anti-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label “pseudo-chomskyst billets”.
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would have been able to convince Suzanne.
Maybe that is what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do as Polly Toynbee and interview it on a veranda, with even the hot hooks at the mount!
As Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell, but ended to become one of his fans and invited him to his emission, it is too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come.
It is possible in a political talk that exists since generations, but which has been marginalised by traditional media, including the Guardian, since generations.
This "brown" is particularly shown in my eyes that the intellectual debate has not long been held in the history's RDVs where Office stories have become minorities and where the exchange of specialists has been benefited from condensed loans of type Sciences Po for pressing dossiers.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Peter Bourdieu as well as the of Michael Foōault, a need to take it to a guilty, a pupil.
They develop one and another of very reasonable reasons, but this rationality is based on these issuers who are the key to vote in their thinking.
Instead, I believe that for Fo Papaault the State was essential as a guilty.
This involves a very archaic thought, the sacrifice thought, which is also the magic thought.
We resolve the problem of the report to the other by eliminating it.
There is anarchising, neo-lib and/or/libertary pen ( of the two terms the second marks a duration of the desire of the State's erradication , the first knowing to go seeking the State's help for its markets ) in the meaning of at least the State / not the entire State at Foōault .
The old dream of the base that is self-being.
His thinking is built on State's fault: without that, it does not stand.
He who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here .
No other support .
The totalitary left remembers the good old time, the one of his god then, Staline, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you have probably read a chouya too quick if you took the Fo\ault texts on the Iranian revolution for Khomeiny's apology.
Today, even Pierre Manent wouldn't have fun to attack Michael by this way...
Left puts a deep reflection on the contemporary and collective individual, on the difficulty representing the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal companies.
Whether we agree or not with him, it's an original and respectful thinker.
See this horse-orchestrated cabinet by researchers in hard-left scientists that do not support the allocation to their mantras, it is quite riable.
The narcissism and the spirit of these people are unlimited.
An important point to be to me is to be the posture of these "rebelles", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other "glass" I was witness in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure to hear our Australian friends about this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese last time.
In London and they were sympathy to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think like the Bla's!
My family lives in ≥ after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hold some of them violently anti-Blancs.
My father is not happy that his old daughter goes out with a Bla.
I also believe that the attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in the past years: they are more rich, prosperity is spread outside the large cities, and through this prosperity people travel to the foreign and see how others live.
As I have been told, the Russians have particularly prejudices against temporary workers without qualification originating in Caucase and Central Asia, who work in offices and areas where they have many chances to be exploited by their employees or against a high crime and violence.
Although I've seen the rivers of the Enissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the opinions of the Chinese and Aboriginians.
It's really strange that a foreigner tells me that I don't support the Chinese, while I met two of them in my life (as one in the foreign), did not keep bad memories, all people are worthy and, in fact, those in London were very worthwhile is the only reason why I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise, we don't remember who we meet, all people are worth, how to remember who was.
You know what's weird?
Let you and the other Russian here talk about Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
Yet, you're always out with Lady Bla.
How many Chinese men are with Whites in comparison?
No one, because there are many chances that the parents of these Whites would aggresse them PHYSIQUEM.
No measure of non-partiality of justice.
However, this is the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups highly marked at the left like the syndicate of the jurisdiction...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the legal media are sincerely marked right.
When the Court's Syndicat represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be made from the relativeness of the application of laws in courts, it orders to separate two obstacles.
The political vision of the observer as the actual interpretation of the court.
It remains then the law-making tool to renew the evaluation of the staff.
The measurement of its unobservance in the context of Judge Acts, including the parquet, forces to make a distinction between the error and the partiality of the judges.
It would be unfair to claim that the acts of justice are not separate from these three groups.
Preservation and ignorance are not relevant to an objective analysis.
And then, if all this is not analysed, how can we say that justice improves in France?
If it is only by statistics that implicitly show that it is part of very low.
The preambulenten allows the following in the third.
The Corruption* of the Court of Justice.
Sensitive subject in proportion of the power of injury* which is granted to the judicial institution capable of such heritage.
The area concerned is the spoliation* of heritage done up to the procedure* by successive genealogists mandated by noters.
This profession is a good year of 150 million euros by benefiting from the coverage of the nearly immunity of the French note.
For understanding their mechanism, a part was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this approaches the statistical improvement* moderated by the comment, the Judicial institution has produced, in many differences between genealogists and inheritants who are able to make such a spolier, one in the contrary to all inheriting laws.
Isn't the presentation of European statistics ignoring this type of rational criteria, then, a form of lying?
Absolutely complete prices.
Encourage the material to arise the disabilities.
It can be said, but my brother has one of these tricycles all the way, built by measure to its size and weight, and it really allowed him to benefit from full air as never a normal round wheel, with wheels and wheels covered, couldn't.
As we say, the goats and the colors...
The Tankchairi is nothing to what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks like EPIQUE.
I think the Whill's inventor never had to clean a dog's crap on a kitchen.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle everywhere, but it's just too dear.
The rulling ultra long distance wheel would be perfect for a handicapped with a penchant for the longboard.
Here are some of them that would like them.
Prices are actually high, but there are people who put this type of price in a wheel, then ‘ you see. ’
The tricycle everywhere is especially useful to me.
Not everyone is poor, however.
Many of them have a reasonable amount insurance.
Only if they have been disabilities.
The thing is that the rolling wheel market is a nine, so they can allow themselves to practice high prices for things they all know that it is necessary for us.
We can't really say that the Whill is a minimalist.
It's an example of design.
Unfortunately, it's just a beach, it's not intended to make it.
I CONTENT that the "long distance" rolling wheel doesn't come on the market, because it seems that there is no way to conduct this fashion thing.
Approximately 20 000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, in intensive bombing of deeply small residential quarters.
Two million humans are captives of the Israeli block of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
The half is children and youths who are less than 18 years old.
Eight-year-old children have seen their whole life under Israeli blocks!
Single situation in the world, inacceptable situation, illegal situation, also because this block affects a "collective punishment" with all Gaza citizens.
" Undertakers who work on their projects turn a little away from their ciment to the black market " ...
Ah, that's not the wood tongue, rather than beton and armed the lady...
References are here to support a argument or a fact.
Antisionists...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's a black market that's certain, and recognised.
Two million humans are captives of the Israeli block of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, inacceptable situation for everyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States have a well-reserved territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to rule because the dictature (who you know) excluded it!
Don't forget also what after he raised it, Morsi had restored the block!!!
And I'm an O'al, so I'm approving...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israel-Egyptian...
Gaza's children live on a subterraneous fortress, built against the population who chose his masters!
Having a ship, it's a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you've been thinking well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Arbnb.
This is the same definition of the share economy, without profitable purpose.
Many are just looking for a shot of a night on Couchsurfing.
So it's making it pay (or at least expect it) in another way.
It's always much less dear than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
Furthermore, the owners and the confidential residents often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in species, which thus turn Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this.
"What is it placed on"?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The term "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's a international journal now, if you didn't notice.
It would be better to have the right assurance for the ship, make sure that it is 100% in accordance with all safety rules and ask those who manage channels and implies to practice a trade activity (what they will certainly do). I have a ship and I tried to see how to praise it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, in short, it's really a cauchemar...
Did you think that battles can be moved, stealed and repeated, cooled, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if someone tried to steal it would always be near where you left her.
Or declined by pirates...
All these Somalian immigrants who come here and attack our peninsulas...
Where are you going to pick it up?
Not Marine The Pen is not right!
Population?
There is no other truth than the one that exposes the facts!
Poverty increases in France.
More than 150 000 youths leave the oil without training.
The richness in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the messaging will be told!
Capitalism will not be opened!
The high financing, speedy, therefore plays with our businesses our jobs, with our primary materials, so our purchases, our foods, our health structures, our debts, our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold.
All this benefits from some hyper-mega-obesses of the fridge.
Until the contrary, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is the finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed an Economy Minister of the Rothschild Bank, an elder of the Rothschild Bank, the story of better defending the interests of banksters, only responsible for the crisis of 2007.
Was there nobody else competitor?
You call this how: return his clothes, kiss his bottle?
Primary and popular reaction
Actually, we don't know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans have secured the surroundings.
I'm not sure Spee has really "beat" to secure the surroundings.
One of the aspects of this battle is that none of the parties seemed to be sure of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book “Castles of Steel” suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British coach in the area.
The sea was holiday at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after the sun's sleep, making any safeguard operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, the Malawis's, where, on the photos showing the surroundings being secourus, a quiet and full day sea is seen.
Moreover, the safeguards believed that there were no more German fighters in the area.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I made a quick research on Wikipedia:
“A certain confusion ruled among the German ships about the sort of the two crossed crossers, who had disappeared in the black after they had stopped the driving, and a cycle-pourput started.
Leipzig lived something in the fire, but when he came near, he saw that it was just an epave.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German vessels, join the battle lately and live the Monmouth, painted and severely damaged but still moved.
After pointing to its projectors on the ship's ship, the proposal to be made up and opened the fire, finally running the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee felt that the Good Hope had to escape and stop research at 22:15.
Anxiety about reports indicating a British coach in the surroundings, he hit the north. ”
So if that is true, the Germans, in the darkness before the invention of the radar, didn't know that a ship had fallen, and couldn't find surroundings.
They also thought there was a more important royal Navy cover in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in confusion, they defeated to benefit from their advance.
They were far away from their base and Spee had well aware that they should walk a way through many ships of the Royal Navy.
The victim of Cradock had already caused them a mistake and had covered about half of their municipalities, condemning them so when they were finally taken.
There are several votes to the OMP to ask that it be inscribed in the law that a permanently convicted election is definitively unemployable.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch the elects of the right left.
But noon, it's a blague.
For this idea I propose an inscription on the consequences of the Magisters
When is the prohibition of syndicates in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality be tolerated between citizens?
The politicians, whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, are still quick to appreciate those who will benefit from their inappropriateness to prevent the action of true policies, who are really trying to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilization is in terms of their supply.
I met them in the midnight meter with their small pancarts' unders for justice" they came from the province and did not distinguish between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of political syndicates whose members have the great power they have in the service of its party.
It would not defend the same tess if right-hand syndicates, even right-handly, designed for the purpose of its board's personalities and led to them a legal-median war.
Your statements are totally free.
If the right currently distorts the juvenile presentation is that it has just done the facts that are relevant to it!
We have no example of the personality of the left that had so much to do with Justice but all those who were focused on it did not have a favor-treatment.
On the other hand, it is also necessary to remember that the syndicat of the jurisdiction that is on the left is not the only syndicate of judges and that it is minority.
That a minister supports the syndicates with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The syndicat you quote may be minority among judges, but its influence is great to the Chancellerie, it is not a secret.
We are now wondering if the "mission" of certain judges is not more to go out than to teach.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: you forget that judges are not officers like the other: they are the only ones who have the power to put and capture each one.
Jade Goody?
What if any of the participants would never come back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most hungry debt of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, then I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many used it as tremplin to start a successful career.
The One Directory fills the stages of the world.
Others then sold many disks or left to West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programmes, launched Chreyl Cole, which is actually part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all made the concurrence of Eurovision, as well as many others.
While others such as Frank Sinatra and all the rest participated in concurrence in the United States.
In the 70s and 80s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks started most of British TV stars.
Of course, some have fallen in forgotten.
But that's what happens to most of the stars that do not participate in the concurrence.
Rarely are those who, after a tube, succeed in doing it.
In any way, most songs / groups can best expect three albums and a best of.
Yes, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the United Kingdom.
His célébrity is part of his marriage with a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who is Jeremy Clarkson.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it is more likely to move on a career than the typical roadway of the rock, even if in your dreams you think that all the fridgers to guitte that smoke grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a poem level of primary school will certainly become stars and that the only question is how they want to touch before even exiting an album.
And worse than ridicule: this sets a completely artificial distance between the west public and the people studied – a distance quite quickly turning to racism, because sacralist ethnologists present us these people as extremely superstitial and ritual bigotery petris, while most of them are strictly equivalent to our and inspired, such as ours, of practical considerations on the day.
Unless you are unreversely interpreted.
Or, but rather than say that the tambour is unclean of holy character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières have also a little holy character?
Our way is as reminded of seeing the sacred as a kind of well-defined and circumscripted in the religious area.
The article is very interesting in what it is.
It's an ephemer deco to meet the empty.
Nothing else.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrated figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of holy is always living.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would be cast to the orties of the interpretations of non-wide scientists who endure the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is there a critical comparison of disciplines so that we can slow down a little?
Because what is worth for archaeology is also worth for the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your disappointment for the archaeologists is actually unjust!
It is because they have continually covered treasures, precious witnesses to reconstitute the history, understanding companies, and the example of comparative archaeology here is passionate.
This method is not very old and the archaeologists earlier believed in their "instinct" and their knowledge, and to troop themselves.
Today, technical and scientific means are so perfect that the interpretation of fo's is better but can always be released in the case of other covered!
It is in full (and old) polymetic on the challenism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (see the book The Challenges of the Pre-History, especially the increased reedition of the scientific controversy, published in the editions The House of Rocks).
Thank you for this strongly instructive article
Hetherous men love anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put it.
So it's done between us?
I don't really understand why can't we continue to three?
This magazine is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall in the cave?
No, but we're not against a theater room over there.
We couldn't look at a musical comedy over there, however, it would be too gay!
We could expect to have such a comment from you.
Mary Whitehouse seems to come back from the dead.
Since your test offer is almost complete, I can suggest you to go to Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more with you.
He prefers Mikedow.
I can suggest that we all look for a journal that pays true journalists, courageous, to write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. to their risks and dangers.
Rather than make ricane with these puerty bullets.
Not very bad.
Let's go.
If these "powery bullets" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, isn't it?
Do you also know that this magazine also covers the Middle-East and Ebola and that it is actually possible to do both and to discuss anal sex articles?
Is that the subject that shoots you, or is it that people regret it?
Yet, we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
The crash amateur video on the net...?
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the pilots, it would have been safe because at the moment or other vehicle (for example, depreciated) would have entered the circuit.
But it had to end quickly before the typhon that we knew he was coming, but for which the FOM didn't feel good for the time of the department (television, pub, money...).
But otherwise they protect the pilots.
Well, I also share this opinion.
But there's also that if the very British FOM enters the SC, she'll allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to restart the...
You're leaving on this blog my dear Dayrton.
But it's not serious, I've got a little time to buy all your c*****ries.
No, just not.
There were a number of conspirations in F1, but never one who puts the Commissioners in danger of death for a long history of the possibility of victory of a pilot to detriment of another.
This isn't the FOM that is safe because it's the FIA.
Size nuance.
In view of amatory images, the absence of images allows FIA particularly to avoid genuine questions of the type: How does the Commissioner take a green flag in full intervention and continue to do it after it (see the complete video after the a.e.)
No, it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the FIA blocks the images of it, but because one of the Commissioners is seen aggressively a green flag, signs that the course can recover normally and that we are more under yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark ignorance of the F.
Yes, sweetheart Etienne, the course is no longer under the yellow flag scheme APRES the place of it, from which the green flag is aggressed.
That's the usual procedure.
The station of commissary just below a'a'l (only the case, it may be 10 meters as 100 meters after the a·a) takes the green to tell the pilots to recover a normal time.
Sensationalism makes the pub sell.
Before I thought the media were part of the " Patriotic" propaganda of the government, but I fear that it was just for money.
And sex, don't forget sex, fear of not having sexual life, public and media are good to sell us things needed to improve our sexual life.
The information does exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with information that we really don't need to worry is just to keep fearing people so that we can continue to control them.
“When the tabloids are all about Ebola, we all catch fear” This should be “delaying”, not “all.”
Since the medical reference, “allser ” is better said in this context than“ relaxing. ”
I wonder if everyone who claims that Ebola could begin to spread up airway realize that they now believe in evolution?
You make them too honorable.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the Apocalypse that approaches.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confund Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that smiles beautifully and solidly this pseudo-journalism abject.
It made me feel good.
I'm depressed that media talk about most of the things with this optimism in the opposite.
The goal is again to keep us quite scared and anxious (without reaching histery) for the government can cause us to get out when he needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to submit a budgetary emergency in the abstention of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the abstention of any attention, why not have an Ebola crisis in the abstention of any case?
He wants this government to save us from the crisis he invented himself.
Is there anything really difficult with the idea of governing fear?
Congratulations for this post, and to be still of this world almost 35 years after.
Moreover , it had to be horrible at the beginning , see the context of the 1980-90s.
I'm bluffed, living with the certainty of passing there for years ....
The testimony is perfectly inutile.
Like always when we talk about sciences.
Not only the testimony serves nothing: they are isolated, they cannot use scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective appreciation of facts.
@trafic: The testimony cannot be used as scientific material.
It may be for this reason that we are unable to ask questions to patients in psychiatry when we have confidential observations from neighbors.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatric mother explains that I was telepathyly trained by her beauty mother.
So this is a symptom of objective.
When I say it's crazy, it's a subjective testimony without importance.
Ah, because the testing of a fact (= here this testimony, which proves of contamination and efficiency of new treatments) does not serve anything in a scientific approach?
On what are you based on research, then?
On fantasms?
Do you place at the same level fantastic theories and facts (= testable tests)?
"Resilience" means the bidon word adulted by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, which takes place for great psychologists after reading D'ansmbourg.
@Jim: There are many empty buzzwords in the psychs.
Cyrulnik made us the “resilience. ”
As a big scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will have embraced us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this great resilience.
I wonder if the air Sentineles could save us all from Farage and Company?
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to highlight the air Sentinellas...
So why?
It was a great series, and it seems that those who show it have a conscious conscience!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to do so that kids can cross?
The only solution that comes to me is the humor type of pipi-cacaca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series of children.
Children were cracking.
Ah, because it's a series for children?
The UKIP works for Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Always in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same if you don't see the sons and the animation is done well. :-)
I'm quick to see this (when I'm an adult), but I hope that this will give the idea to a chain of refining old people.
The series has almost never stopped to be spread here in ≥; it is at least 40 years that we have episodes of one hour on Saturday and Sunday at 06:00.
Since the free digital television is a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial chains and it can always be seen at these hours.
In addition, the episodes of a half hour pass at 05:30, from Monday to Friday!
All right, I'm probably a "trist" guy of 60 years, but I don't look at this series every day!
There is no "Mont of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the lightning !!!
The radical sionists invented this to give themselves a political stimulation to colonize Jerusalem.
Furthermore, all Israeli fo's fo's below and around the mosque of the sprays for decades have not been allowed to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists it is elsewhere.
Can he be in argentin?
This mountain is not searched for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosque's planade was built.
His top, or Rocher's damn, is shailly in the middle of Omar's mosque.
For the Muslims, Mahomet is ascended to Paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac there.
Since it was taken and contested, there is no propaganda but information, dear K1K.
Israel also counts his extremists, it is good to remember it regularly, and they are unfortunately relaxed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, who had accepted the plan of 2 states, and has constantly saved it!).
It is so good to show how anxiety in Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize his people?
The shortest of the Jewish blagues: "God be praised!"
To overcome the tourism in Israel, we are often showing youths of semi-dealed naiadas, along the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what publicity shows us, as we can see on the picture that illustrates the article.
It's a little scared at all.
And this photo is a wonderful propaganda work!
Sorry that the photograph of Re日s had not taken the hundreds of Palestinians authorised to return to the Mount of the Temple and prefered to cattle the faithful Jews in contrabs, praying to the Mure of Lamentations.
@Mat, If this photo demands you, it's right, it's not the journal or the photograph, but this woman and the idea that she's going to be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end in weeping.
The only way to end this system is revolution.
Since the economy has gone abroad, large enterprises have benefited greatly from their employees.
They succeeded to convince their salaries that they had the chance of having a job and that they could not allow their salaries, while at the same time and without hiding themselves, they gave more important rewards to the small elite at the top.
You're right, it's not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when the workers will really talk about one voice.
Instead of smiling and of gene when someone else makes it hard, support them, demonstrate a little solidarity and understand that their grip does not only affect their problems, but also shows to your employer that people are not impugnated.
Unless we leave democracy, what if it is sustainable.
I'm totally agreed.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
As for example China and India.
All this can't be done well.
It's because we're in democracy that it has done.
Have you voted for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Partnership for Trade and Investment (PTCI) aims to increase the benefits of companies held by these people by short-circumciding national governments by secret courts.
It seems incredible, but that is exactly what the mechanism of regulating differences between investors and States (ISDS) is used in the agreement proposed.
The Green are against this project and try to warn people about the inimaginable deficiencies that this agreement will have on our lives.
Recently we start talking about this in media: Indian Guardian World Development Movement See therefore these links and you will understand what is negotiating in your back.
Did Churchill not say "blood, sugar and tears"?
This is what makes great retombees, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on trees.
The next low maillon will certainly be the car market.
This gentleman was right, in the 18th century there were syndicates in all the regimes.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a victim dimension.
Let it (endly, her officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe the coffre-force of France's internal values, and she will shut up and shut her back.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, shortly: the dissolving of the idea of the nation, having this small rest, is comforting.
Even if it's more inconfortable for her...
You still miss the syndicat of married men, celibatary, married women, celibatary, lost dogs and I don't know anything else
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm singing.
You've been warned, that's your fault.
In order to defend the categories of interests, protected professionals are already adequate, which has caused a breakdown of equality with the other citizens.
We are praying not to laugh about the fear of the risk of a officer.
It is very well to imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without syndicate, or then without the right to grew like in Germany, in contrast to the protection they enjoy.
Other catastrophes insured.
And with the charts that are prepared, the Government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignoring...
Ignorance for the ignorance of Sybille I made an allocation to military and other officers, since this is the subject here commented...
Let us remove "with its delegates" in Article 8 of the Constitution Preambule of 1946.
It will be: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of work conditions as well as the management of businesses."
This is absolutely essential with the irrecovery of the informative power.
And yet you opened, probably read, then commented on an article specifically titled "The Great British Bake Off review". ????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought it had to start the conversation.
In any way, it's Joffrey's marriage I've seen, and I can tell you that some have been well seated.
In the Joffrey's marriage episode, we have one of the best moments (which foolish: it was the wine) in the television history.
So, from the mixture mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
It's the second time of defeat that, strangely, the emission ends with a victory of the less worst bulling ; no one has made a kind of “boom, here is my fucking ass now, buck it and turn down before your master”!
Maybe the additional pressure of friends and parents outside has finally affected them?
In the weeks, all of these foreign people were held in the art.
And there is also this idea of " playing security, always next week" that disappears last week.
I love kissing, but I don't imagine to influence this.
I am eager to those who do it and thus offer us a super entertainment and moves us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, the last challenge of the last year, the wedding chat, was absurd.
Professors generally set days to make them, and they devote them to brick one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to leave, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only true failure they could find was the base a little dry (although I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard's mouth did not want, in any way Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several challenges in this series are a little artificial because of a time-time.
There's also the cancer that looks, with the sun-wind shots.
Of course, all of us are successful at this point.
A bad time to pass for mankind, we hope it.
You confund solar wind and ultraviolet rayons.
UVs are mainly blocked by the ozone bed that is just formed by the impact of residual solar wind particules and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field was devastated, there would not be enough solar wind to "sleep" the stratosphere ozone.
There would be even more, so less than UV and “cancers”.
Happy that the ozone bed doesn't block UVs.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we are limited to humans, they are interested in allowing us to have bones (vitamine D synthesis), to heat us (infrared), to modulate our immune system, and, it means, to improve our moral.
The ozone bed blocks cancer UVCs and allows UVAs and most UVBs to pass.
Do you know that you don't have to be condescent and view your interlocutor as a stay when you put a comment?
In particular for a small precision that was understood in the comment, which himself hears to prove pedagogy.
Without saying I am a melanomic habit, UVs only make ACCELER its development.
They don't propoquent him.
For evidence: all brassed people have no force of melanoms.
Or, when a toubib tells you that you must avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cave, it is better not listening because the UVs are necessary for all humans.
The excise, however, is like all: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs directly cause melanomy.
Can we beat it?
And, more important, can we pass it to the mixer?
or go to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be plugged if there is a sufficient force and the strength of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the use it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a first-line communication material.
But for us others,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be plugged if there is a sufficient force
Except Nokia 3310.
More precisely, is he already stuck?
We are doing this blame in each debate.
I decided to count them.
It's the fourth blague on the plague I've read in the comments today.
It is difficult to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before installing specific software, it is imagined that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and it is wrong to see how it could return.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..........................................
The most important is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and which is therefore co-operated with the installed business test code.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on everyone?
Photographs on Ebay show no FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype plugin.
ah the article for bobo by excellence.
We want little dear products and we're surprised that industrials produce in "Industrials" We're putting forward super u, but all teachings and small trades are concerned How to buffle good, bio avac 1650€ (medium salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat correctly with a small salary.
Everyone is free to put his priorities there where it is.
For my part, food is one.
Let's go without a rancune, I'll love you.
People who see the world through a ideological “software” that led them to disconnect realities.
That's the total degree of thought- reasoning.
They are gesticulation experts, for example, claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a dust.
They are also experts in tartufery, joining the left-caviar, which sometimes have been expired, for example, condemning CO2 rejections while covering their vacations in Maldives.
The majority of our concitoyans do not support this mixing of severe and tartufery ideology, too, is not surprised to meet often criticisms about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theory and for all associated details (plane, dust...).
I'd like to be part of it, but I don't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecolos are monoblocks.
Did you understand the concept of the left-caviar?
And you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It's the perfect copy with just a ideological nunce.
The classification would be more complex if we were interested in schools.
The boboécolo is part of it, but it only represents the most ≥ schools because it is the one that affects the media.
Here's a beautiful girafe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front.
She's so bad that she's not worthwhile to a female nud.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It must be a part of the art microcosme to understand the stupefiant beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply have no initiative to make a comment because you haven't spent numerous decades to study and flatter large artists.
It is not important that Emin doesn't know of them and always obsessed by the same subject.
The important thing is that she really has succeeded to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic capacity.
That's the art.
No, it's a cowboy.
The fact that Emin doesn't know about them
That's not really a fair fact.
It is not a opinion.
Unless the only thing you could appreciate is the realistic reproduction of dogs that smoke by playing the billard.
Judging art may be difficult, but not in that case.
From these, it is much more than just representing the real.
If you're just looking for this, a camera will do the case.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionnism.
Look again and let the image talk about itself, without comparing it to the type of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are more economics to do: equipment activities, the number of horses of the Republic Guard or the status of generals that are no longer active....
L(honnesty requires to say that France reduces its efficiency, but as all countries, sometimes more drasticly, begin by Great Britain.
It's just half encouragement...
Operator without support, it's quickly finding its limits!
A single approach, when we observe weaknesses, the lack of our defence tool, particularly in Sahel.
A bad impact on the local collectivities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities, or even a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuation?
@edmond: That's what I said, look where to do economy, but especially not with me, it's really not possible with me...
That's exactly what you're suggesting to do, looking elsewhere the gigi is certain.
Let all those who have covered a little or enough military thing come here to say, the eyes in the eyes that there are no money in this perimeter and this without laughing...
To apply the same potion to the function and the finance will be a little better.
And for Josi: really clouds: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministers and you will understand why the Defence can feel a little loaded!
Well, the economys of which everyone agrees to say that we need to do them, even though this is somewhere, isn't it?
It's lack of pot, those on whom it falls to the rubber when it happens with them, the poor dear.
It should be, but especially that it doesn't fall on me because, in this case, it's a crime and not a economy.
Guig's, go!
In what way will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defense tool at Sahel?
As regards local collectivities, the story is repeated to each post closure, maternity, hospital, casher.
But everyone's for the economy.
It is weird, a Major UMP who wants compensations and does not enjoy economics made in the expenses.
This article is really the most amazing thing I've ever read!
At that moment, the first three people who comment on do the same bad blague.
It is the depression to roll his Facebook file and to see that 80% of his friends started their status by the phrase "This is the moment of disturbing".
I think they're going to make a movie.
He will certainly be based on lighting scenes where somebody falls in his ex in the bus by going to work and only realizes where his jupe returned to his cow.
It's not funny, it's totally with.
Not really, I think the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to hurt his emotions and shut the teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of his return to scene after 25 years of absent was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now in the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
No computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I'm going!
I can't believe how much this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has actually shown that it's all over the top of the cosmic universe that is the saterical journalism!
I'm going to fall in the river!
I need absolutely to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the ilumination and discover the incredible light and the inexorable genius that gets from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine lighter.
Oh, my God, it was really no.
Especially if they are not women or travesties.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development in democracy: the integration of regional policies and effective associated initiatives.
Until a new order, we make us confiscat the right to save our planet by States who play the tartuffs at each meeting to save the planet.
So, citizens, we decide to take things in hand.
With the Commissioner they have planted in energy, all these beautiful recommendations have been enveloped ....
Translate: Eolish and solar closes are the Round points tomorrow.
All financed by the constitutional.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radio activity is much worse at the level of its waste and in case of a.
As long as the branch is not controlled in its integrity, it is better to limit it to workers.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, in order that we are obvious to decrease our consumption drasticly.
Electricity by the renewable to fight CO2 emissions?
France is not involved in anything.
Nuclear election is no CO2 emission to production and epsilon for other steps.
The election by the renewable oil or PV is already more of GES on the other steps and especially gas, or worse of carbon like in Germany, to acquire intermission.
Place the nuclear by renewable oil or PV would be against the fight against CO2.
Christial I don't insult you I'm State doctor in sciences in 1981, more I've done nuclear research I'm putting you in the challenge to prove the contrary to what I said.
For what I didn't say, you're the one who makes me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany, you didn't really answer what I said and like all people right to demolirate the interlocutor I'm never doing it.
I also cite the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: the current German renewable energy programme is an inefficient and inefficient means to reduce GES emissions and should be suspended.
0 emissions if you don't count the extract of the ura and the construction and if you don't count the low-effective gas vacuum that the Co2 is actually reminded of the two thirds of energy produced by a nuclear central part of water vacuum and a little in the water of the waters.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a "South Asia Giant"...!
The last time Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I am not surprised that most Indians who have comments want to read and make comments only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, that shows your mind.
It would have been the same if they had qualified South Asia's Geant India...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistan players participate, but having a Pakistanian version would be inacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As regards the ISL, today's opening match was amazingly interesting, Kolkata's Atletico is 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot of way to do.
In comparison with billions and billions India dedicated to the IPL cricket and now to the football, how can we rival once with our "brown neighbors"...
The low cost of the launcher is paying cash.
Damage for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the lack of possible design is only shown with a helium too cold.
So we may not be in a failure of design, but in practice...
In contrast to arianespace that is a private company, it is well that Soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as this is his own assurance.
Maybe they're going to pay the satellites in fragrants that they know.
This is much worse than many mediums represent the only article titles - and that many readers only hold these titles .
In total, this creates a wrong impression contrary to the contents of the article itself.
In fact, in agreement with you, the title is not suitable, it makes it injustly concerned about the project while it is only a problem of launcher.
