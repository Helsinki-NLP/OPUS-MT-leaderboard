The leader of the Brazilian presidential cabinet is brought before the instance
March, a federal judge accepted the accusations against the former Chairman of the Brazilian presidential cabinet for the assumption of its involvement in a massive corruption scheme on the Petrovas state oil company.
The Office of the Federal Prosecutor stated that Jose Dirceu will be sent in court for the accusations of corruption, distortion and spending of money in this month.
Other 15 will be judged, including Joao Vaccari Neto, the former treasury of the Municipal Party, found in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, former President of the Petrobis undertakings services.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the Partie of Employers held in custody for their debt with this scheme.
Dirceu served as the leader of the former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August, where he was already arrested at home, with a 11-year penalty for involvement in a voting scheme in Congress over 10 years ago.
The prosecutors declared that Dirceu decreased the middle collection scheme from Petrovas, accepted myth while it was in force and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it had been held at the end of 2013 for the buyed votes scandal.
According to the prosecutors, Petrovas scheme involved approximately 2 billion dollars in the form of myth and other illegal funds.
A part of those money would have returned to the campaign fund of the party in the employment and their alliances.
It would also include myth to the Director Petrobis in exchange of contracts.
“Miraculous Recovery” of a survivor student of the Peshawar mask
A paralyzed teenager after four times had been shot in the most purchased terrorist attack in Pakistan has succeeded a "miracular" recovery after a treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years old, Pakistan doctors said that he could never go.
At least 140 decades, most children were killed when armed men attacked the public school of the army in Peshawar in December last year.
Mohamed, who came to London last month for operation, will be extracted later from the hospital.
Exactly in nine months ago, on a usual morning of Tuesday, Mohamed stood at the first aid hour and cared for his teacher.
Even then, seven armed men in the uniforms of guard agents entered the public school of the army.
They had centuries of explosives and had to carry out a simple mission: to kill all men, women, and children who went out.
"I can't forget what happened that day," Mohamed said with a bright look.
I was in the amphiteater, I asked questions... then I heard weapon fires outside.
The terrorists entered and started to kill, our professor was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he brought four students out of the amphiteater while the carnage was spread.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, crying.
He said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I've kept him.
Then I was shot back, and he was in my head.
The most of the murderers in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed remembers that immediately after that he left and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the bread down.
The doctors in Peshawar from the north Pakistan, then those in Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he could never go anymore.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul comes out," Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
The nine months were the worst of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son's so passionate cricket will never be able to use his own.
They made a campaign and asked assistance from the Pakistanian TV, attracting the exhibition of famous people like Imran Khan, the cricket player became political.
One finally, they were able to gather funds to bring Mohamed to the United Kingdom and offer treatment to the private Harley Street Clinic in London.
The neurochirurgyrurg Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "inquired" when he arrived in the hospital.
“There was a few months laying in bed without moving on the other side,” says Malik.
He was weak, he put a lot of pressure on his back.
He wasn't in a pretty good form.
A verb from the foundation of Mohamed's vertebral column fuseous
Mohamed was shot into the shoulder, schold and back during the attack, and the inferno vertebral column was used, leading to paralyzation.
However, during a operation that spent six hours, Malik and his team were able to restore the nervous terminations and rebuild the part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised by what he continued.
Just a week after operation, Mohamed rose up and began to step and go.
We didn't wait for such a good result.
It was a miracle," she said.
At least two weeks after the operation, Mohamed is ready to spend the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed split the horse and began to go again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But it is determined to return to Pakistan, turn into the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel that I have another chance of life," he says, drawing pictures with guns drawn by him low school manuals and styles
Fisic, Mohamed becomes more powerful every day, but the psychological trauma through which it is now unimaginable.
"My fury hasn't been low," he testifies.
At my school, small children were killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother washs his tears, eats him on a grown, and says, "I see my son going again."
He'll be able to keep his lives.
The 4G "Super Voice" service from Three offers a better sign
Three uses a 4G spectrum with more frequency, which can cover an expanded area
Three's mobile phone provider launched a service in the United Kingdom about which it says you'll build the receipt inside the buildings and in rural areas without sign.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to perform calls and send text messages using a spectrum with more frequency.
And other networks intend to introduce the same, as "Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VoLTE)".
This currently works only with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the following months.
Three mentions that pı 5.5 million clients will have to serve in 2017.
Bryn Jones said: "For the end of the year, one million of our clients will have a better coverage inside and will be able to use their phones in more places as now."

That revealed their pantomic secrets at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson, "If I don't do anything, I feel guilty"
Steven Wilson was recently designed as the big winner of Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson has been called many times as the most worker in the world of progressive rock.
The musician talent won three premiums at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, among which the best album of the year for Hand.
In its review of five stars, The Guardian called the album “a smart, expressive, and artificial work”.
Since 1980, Wilson is the engine of more musical projects, most than they are the Porcupine Tree rock.
Now, before two spectacles with household at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launchs a double LP just in vinil format, Transience, to show the side "major" of his activity alone.
He told BBC about his love for vinyls and his program loaded and explained how the comic actor Matt Berry was coming to break the spectacles.
What does it mean for you?
I've grown even in the end of the era of vinyls, and I remember that then I'm just waiting for the CD's appearance, because the vinyl was so exciting.
You bought a disc, you went with him home, had a cup and you had to bring him back.
I love the CDs, and for some kinds of music, such as the classic, are better than vinyls.
But the problem with the CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing to really appreciate.
It's like you've got a beautiful table in the summer.
There's something you can keep in m, while you're absorbed by verses and compiled by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it doesn't have how to be if some young boys too young to remember their vinyls like this kind of experience.
Do you have any faults that you're especially doing?
I recognize that I've been out of all the vinils in the '90s.
All the vinils we've been bought again.
I started from the idea to restore the collection I had at 15 years of age, but I passed over that limit.
The first disc I convinced my parents to buy me was Out of the Blue of the Electric Light Orchestra.
If I had still had the original instance, it would have had a sensitive value, but, unfortunately, it's somewhere through a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes that the album will be a port to possible new fans.
Why did you start your new Transience compilation on vinyl?
This was designed initially as ideas for the Day of Discussion Magazines, but I've broken the opportunity.
My house of discussions suggested to gather some of my shorter and more melodies.
I've been easily made by the idea of doing something "input into Steven Wilson's music" and I felt unexpected that the project was just launched on the vinyl.
Who buys the vinyl also receives a variance downloaded to high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music really?
No, because, even though I'm on a longer musical part, there's one thing I've always appreciated more than anything: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that is more attached to technical complexity than to the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock of all times, has passed the time test because they have always focused on the melodic and atmosphere side.
What are you preparing for Albert Hall spectacles?
They don't want to reveal too much.
The repository will be completely allowed each of the nights.
First, it'll be a version of the spectacle of Hand, which I had this year, but the steroises, with some invited.
The second night it's gonna be more than an incursion in my history, it's being more oriented to the fans who followed me for years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to break your spectacle on the second night?
And I and the others in the tournament team are big fans of the [comodia serial on Channel 4] Toast of London, at the point where we give all the time quoted from it.
I was thinking to do with Matt's music, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
We talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at Royal Albert Hall.
I think I'm extremely happy to get him off.
You repeated some albums such as XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much of this affects your own music?
Don't inspire me consciously of this, but, inevitably, when you destruct these classic albums, they remember you.
My last album alone, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was, of course, the most progressive old school album I ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I replied King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all the year before.
The current album, Hand. Erase., it's much closer, because we work at Tears for Fears and XTC.
Sometimes you are described as the most busy rock music.
That's how you feel?
You can remove the progressive word.
I think I'm probably one of the most working people in the world of music today, and I don't say this proudly, because, please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I have inherited this from my father, who has an ethic of unbelievable powerful work.
If I don't do anything all day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why the remixing work was a gift, because it means I don't have to do just my music all the time.
Music industry is a hard place to make your career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this as a profession.
I'm decent and I'm not rich, but I'm good.
I love what I'm doing, it's a privilege, but if I had been leaving, I don't think I'd be survived.
Transience will be launched in the United Kingdom on September 25.
Steven Wilson will song at Royal Albert Hall on September 28 and 29, as part of his European tour 2015-2016.
A new contract releases jobs at Skytrans
New Skytrans reangularized a part of the air company's staff who lost his job when old Skytrans entered the fall.
Skytrans, rebuilt from the North Queensland, has granted a contract of 25 million dollars to transport the QGC natural gas company employees, which means that 18 members of the team have recovered their work.
Skytrans, a member of the Wild family, became very active in January, after Newman repeated subvented routes that constituted a large part of the aircraft company.
The claim made more communities confront with a isolated potential, and Warren Entsch, a federal national-free parliament for Queensland, was the representative voice of national-liberal critics.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, renewed the mark Skytrans in March.
Michael Thinee, Skytrans's executive director, said that the aircraft with QCG has already created jobs.
"We have been able to reangularize 18 members of Skytrans's staff standardly as pilots and members of the team," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff with a direct logistic experience in the management of flight operations for QGC clients.
In only five months, we married 100% for work, 78 staff members are employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract follows that Skytrans expands its flight operations from his central town in Cairns, which deserves the Cape York and the Torres Straum, and includes a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 flights back weekly for the QGC staff and for the entrepreneur from Brisbane to the sites in Chinchilla and Taroom, in its Dash-8 aircraft from 36 places, starting from Monday, 26 October.
Tony Nunan, the QGC executive director, said that Skytrans had received the contract following a license procedure.
"We are glad that this contract will contribute to the extension of a company in Queensland," he said.
Skytrans contract maintains his high and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal Parliament and Mama Kelly O'Dwyer receives the advice to make a greater reserve of milk to avoid breaking votes in the room
It seems that more women will be part of the cabinet.
The new of Malcolm Turnbull will be learned Monday and there are powerful signs that more women will occupy portfolio.
One of the views in the accent of Kelly O'Dwyer received the advice to make her greater milk reservation for her newborn to avoid the lactation to intervene in her responsibility in Parliament.
The Council comes from the discipline of Scott Buchholz, who further consulted his labourist apologus to find out what is the most possible approach for a parliamentary who is advocating, according to the current orders.
Liberal Parliament Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter, Olivia.
In accordance with the current orders - the set of rules which represent the behaviour of the parliamentaries in the Chamber - the macs that adhere to vote in Parliament.
This means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip didn't know about this exoneration before he consulted the discipline of a position, Chris Hayes, in this problem.
The works were in two cases when O'Dwyer could not participate in a division meeting and could not fulfil its obligation to keep a talk because the clusters started the laughing.
One of these occasions, her team was asked if the parliamentary thought to make her a greater milk reserve instead of laptop.
Scott Buchholz, parliamentary of Queensland, is the discipline of the .
Later, the two resolved their dispute.
Both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources from Buchholz and O'Dwyer stated for Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins division was furious when he was told to make a greater reserve of milk rather than beat his daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This fact is revealed even when the new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull works on the accommodation of his new cabinet.
Buchholz, liberal national parliamentary of Queensland, was promoted in response to the discipline by the former Prime Minister Tony Abbott as part of the negative effect of the censuring motion at February of this year.
O'Dwyer, with Amanda Rish ́th from the Laburist Party and her son, Percy, is one of the three members of Parliament.
The physician, Phillip Ruddock, was divided to only a few days after Abbott was confronted with a censuring position by which he wanted to remove his function, replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, liberal of Tasmania, was also promoted and called adju discipline.
Nickolic held the first page of the newspapers in the last time, after it was discovered that she sent to Turnbull a message in which she wanted to refuse to contest Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after her daughter's birth, Olivia, in May.
It is one of the three parliamentaries who have become the members of this year.
The wording of the Laburist party, Catherine King, said Wednesday that voting for the mothers who were laughing was introduced when her son was a baby.
"Now she's [seven years old]," she wrote on Twitter.
The disciplinary should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and could be promoted under Turnbull, who declared Wednesday that he wanted more women in his cabinet.
"No one wants more than me to see more women in power, influence, in Parliament, in ministers, throughout the world," the Prime Minister stated before the reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included one woman in his first cabinet and, after pressure supported to strengthen the representation of the female in Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet, after the release of December.
Five things he wants the environment of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will markets respond?
Mal Maiden, editorist at BusinessDay, examines the impact that Malcolm Turnbull could have in the business sector.
March, lobby groups in the sector did not know how to demonstrate stronger enthusiasm when Malcolm Turnbull took the country's fractions as a Prime Minister.
The main reason is that most of what many of them would have wanted to see were abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or simply came into a negotiated suspension due to Abbott's political "crash-or-crash-through" style.
Reviews of interest groups have spoken at unison about their hope in the ability of Turnbull to satisfy public interest, to reach a political agreement and to do good things.
So what exactly is the largest companies of the country and their representatives of our new Prime Minister?
ChAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to overcome the negative publicity.
Turnbull himself established as the initial objective of the free trade agreement with China.
In his first speech in which it was announced in the media, the Free Trade Agreement between China and the CHAFTA represented the central point of his attack by the labour leader Bill Shorten.
In August, Turnbull criticized the "revolutive challenges of economic shawnism" from the Laburist Party on that problem and expressed its concern for the racism temptation of critics.
"In the context of ChAFTA, winners are numeric, much more than losers," he said in the same speech.
The medium hopes he wins this debate.
Don Argus, representative of the environment, stressed that this is a essential point, supported, among others, by the A ́i'an Council (which represents the largest 100 companies) and by James Packer, the billion in the industry.
The Media wishes to conclude this agreement, and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to depart from the negative public and negotiate with the whole seat.
The Minister for Small Undertakings, Bruce Billson, supports the recommendations of the Harper analysis.
This could lead from the beginning to certain differences with the environment.
The evaluation of effects applies to large and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer due to the lack of competition.
It is referred to as ‘evaluation of effects’ because it takes not only the actions and purposes of the company but also the effect they will have on the competition and market.
The way this assessment is edited is extremely important for the result.
The Harper Competition Law analysis recommends a change in the evaluation of effects, which will make greater corporations difficult to remove smaller operators from the market.
The Government led by Tony Abbott was by the A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.S.A.S.A.
Turnbull now understands that he wants the whole cabinet to think about what he's going to do.
CA was sought to show that if Turnbull follows the recommendations of Harper analysis, consumers will need to pay greater prices.
It is ironic that the whole environment is the one who advised the new Prime Minister to have a greater respect for the cabinet processes, which Turnbull seems to be and doing by leaving Bruce Billson, the Minister for Small Undertakings (which is by Harper's recommendations) to support its arguments before his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet may contribute to the prevention of cancer to land
Spanish researchers followed women of age between sixty and eighty years.
Those who eat primarily plants, fish and oil have reduced their "significant" probability of land cancer appearance.
Terrence Howard puts the table of mutuality under the sign of the question
Terrence Howard thinks we've completely misunderstood the arithmetic.
The negative person in Empire declared for the Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think one is equal to one.
"How can it be equal to one?" he said.
If once I do one, it means that two don't have a value, because once he has no effect.
Once one, because the fourth root is two - so what is the square root of his two?
It should be one, but we're told that it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't understand exactly what you mean.
Instead of surprising, Howard's teachers didn't agree with his theory, so this cancelled the Pratt Institute, where the chemical engineering study.
"I mean you can't set your eyes when you know something is wrong," he explained.
Howard found the name of the "Terryology".
The actor testifies that it takes time to cut and resume its prefects, serum, magnetics and plastic fuses to illustrate its theory “one time” and other similar theories of its.
He told for a revision that he and his former wife, Mira Pak, passed at 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The Rolling Stone editor described Howard's creations as “infinitely complex, bidimensional and tridimensional shapes, connected with copper serum or captured with magnetics”.
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive the American patent 20150079872 A1 (‘Systems and methods for construction applications’).
Moreover, the actor of the "After a idol" says that Pitagora Einstein and Tesla would "see it" if she had seen the Terriology.
"You know," he says, "I've been asking me since I was three-four years old why a bull took a round form?"
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard added that he hoped to change the course of learning.
"This will be the last century in which our children will learn that once I do one," he said.
They will not need to grow in ignorance anymore.
In twenty years ago, they'll know that one time I'm doing two.
We're on the way to reveal a new truth.
Universal Matematical Truth.
We'll check for a few 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
March, during the "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star sang a little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, interpreting "Mary Had of Little Lamb" as Spears, then showing its voice qualities with the melodia "The Wheels on the Bus" played with the Aguillera's voice.
On his side, Fallon did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also interpreted versions of “I can't Feel My Face” from The Weeknd.
This week, the name of the Great was still in pressure.
On the same day, it was too in the "Good Morning America", where he discovered the incident of the gogoass lens.
Taco Bell hopes the restaurants "Cantina" in which it will be used to become urban interest points
Would you like to have a nice night in the town?
Taco Bell is a option.
On September 22, the Mexico Mexico Restaurants Restaurants will discover a new location in the Wicker Park area in Chicago, offering a menu of aperitive tapes, a freshly drawn by a local artist and even alcoholic baths.
It is the first test location of the "Taco Bell Cantina" restaurants of the band, addressed to youths, concentrated in the centres of towns.
Taco Bell, who has approximately 6000 restaurants in the United States, has its roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with yellow food, quickly prepared, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With an average Taco Bell pay note of 7 USD, the company used driver-through service and quick services to reach the number of clients necessary to benefit.
However, Taco Bell points out that, to address the new generation that “seeks the most central urban environments in which they live, work and work”, test places must follow a model with smaller spaces and niceer options.
So that you can do a driver-through, you need the ground.
Can you imagine what it means to buy a landscape in a area like Wicker Park?
"Don't allow you," said for the United States TODAY Neil Borkan, the Taco Bell franchise that will operate the location in Chicago.
At the location of Chicago, the new menu will be prepared together with the traditional offers Taco Bell, in a decade kitchen, where "You will be able to see food at your own" before it is prepared, declared for the Press Meredith Sandland, boss for dez in Taco Bell.
Moreover, at the new place, wine, beverages and wine will be used, following the recent example of many of the Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventeen and five of Starbucks coffees offer menus "noon" including beer, wine and pleasure.
One thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic drinks.
Company said that a different location of Taco Bell Cantina would be disconnected in San Francisco sea AT&T Park this month, replaced the driver-through service and parking with a internal court and a window for sales.
These changes of location, atmosphere and attachments indicate the fact that the fast food Restaurants band wants to draw the other type of clients outside those who search for fast food late night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time to a higher quality culinary line in 2012, when he introduced Cantina menus and more beautiful burritos to competite with Chipotle, the project was supported by a public campaign attached to the content of the protein of the new preparations.
If they succeed, the Cantina restaurants will represent another step to a higher level.
Taco Bell said, in 2022, he intended to remove 2000 restaurants in the United States.
According to Sandland for the AP, "A few hundred" of them will be like "Cantina".
They locked the phones at midnight: Elton John makes Putin's courts
The Russian President Vladimir Putin contacted Elton John on Monday night only a few days after the British artist declared publicly that he wanted to meet the Russian politician to discuss the antigay law in Russia.
The British, homosexual declared song, tried without succeeding to get an interview with Putin while it was in Russia in November 2014, one year after the protests of this land and continued two concerts in 2013, in a period of aggression in the history of this state, after adopting conflicted laws, which prohibit "proclaiming homosexual" in the case of minors.
In 2014, in Sankt Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and made the following statement before the fans: "When I'm gay, I've always felt well received here, in Russia."
If I wouldn't be honest about what I'm, I couldn't compil these songs.
It doesn't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express my life.
If we start punishing people for something like that, then the world will lose mankind.
The past Samba, the artist discovered that they wanted to meet Putin to discuss this controversy issue.
For now, there are no clear information about telephone discussions between the two personalities.
Cocos "sing" all in the ANNRP directory
The man of Dorin Cocos tried to be saved from a murdered sentence, "canting" all before the judges and detailing how the millions of euros of the former members of the ANNRP Commission were presented.
Reviewed yesterday at the High Court of Casation and Justice in the directory where a son's courts is judged or Alin Cocos, by the former Officer of DIICOT Alina Bica and by the former members of the Central Commission for the Stabilisation of the Departures in the ANNRP, Dorin Cocos was struck by the lumination of sincerity.
He repeated all the accusations and told the judges how he helped Gheorghe Stelian in the case of the ANNRP discharges, instead of trying to be judged quickly and counted on his cooperation.
So Cocos seemed to know Gheorghe Stelian still in 2006 and that he was imprisoned after more immobilization.
He stated that Sergiu Diacomatu met him in 2010, and he told him to work at the ANSRP.
Later, I found that (Diacomatu, n.e.) is president, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at ANNRP, I asked him to help us.
I promised his money, 2.5 million euros, the money I told him I would give them more transactions.
I also promised political explanation to take function.
"Diacomatu told me to help me, but he needed sustenance," Dorin Cocos showed in the court room.
He further said that by a knowledge, he entered in connection with Crinuta Dumitrean, who then was the Chief of the Central Commission of Refugees, which promised him 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second dossier, I knew that he wanted to get over $300,000.
Diacomatu already had a political explanation, and I gave him five million euros.
The Dumitrean Crinute, a million euros, and Dragos Bogdan, I gave him 800,000 euros.
I'm exactly giving all these money in the transes to make sure the file will be solved.
"I said to them, to solve the folder, to pack the wastebasket," she showed Cocos.
Ask why, Dorin Cocos stated that he received eight million euros for the positive solution of Gheorghe Stelian's second dossier.
For the second dossier, I received eight billion euros to solve the problem, but I collected only 1.2 billion euros.
In 2013 I got Alina Bica.
"I never talked to this about money or lands," she showed Cocos.
He ever seemed "he was noticed that all the members were understood before sitting."
I had no emotions that they wouldn't vote positively.
All functions were political in the ANSRP, but I personally didn't help Diacomatu politics.
"I told him that he helps politics just to quiet him," he completed his Cocos statement.
The European Justice Court of Justice of the DNA
First Victor Ponta was at DNA yesterday, for only five minutes, while he put new documents in the "Turceni - Rovinari" folder.
Victor Ponta fled to DNA with a document of the European Court of Justice
By convinced that the case prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the margin of the file in which it is investigated in private signatures, complexity in tax evasion and cash splitting, Victor Ponta went from its own initiative to DNA, as well as the documents they could be sent by a lawyer.
It wasn't so, the prosecutor had no time, the first walking after five minutes, while he left more documents in the register.
I wanted to submit the decision of the European Court of Justice of 3 September, which explains what happens to the contracts of services.
I say we've been working, the prosecutor says we did not, the European Court of Justice told us to see us both of the work, because, as long as taxes were paid, it's okay.
"On the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, certainly, for all European Union countries, we have no case here," said Prime Victor Ponta at the exit of DNA.
The point has further said that the decision of the European Court should be applied, in the case of we are members of the EU.
Since then, the first expected the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court and call it again to hear, but to give him a answer to his requests, among which it was dismissed.
John is the mandate of the Far TV
In Romania today, there is no legal provision to force you to look at TV.
And you don't even have such a camera since you pay your TV tax once with energy.
But if you're the head of the state, things change radical.
Because, practically, it is understood that, in the case of the President of Romania, it is also recorded to the recurrence of daily realities.
President Iohannis is confunded suddenly in a total silence in the office or from Cotroceni
Only that, at the end of the closest people from the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Johannis refused to have television in the presidential office.
And after not looking at television - to any program, not even on the RTL or Pro Sieben posts -, the president did not hold the radio posts nor read the newspapers.
Furthermore, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the precedent or a priority request.
On the contrary, Iohannis was going to receive only the report of the stirs that put him in a positive position.
And on the hand of this informal automotive, where the only breast is facebook's, is more seriously the blocking to which, through its passion, the head of the State implys the activity of the Presidency.
And this because, since he had passed so bitterly from his installation, Johnnis has not yet signed the loyalty statements of more than half of the presidential employment.
What becomes a more serious problem, as human as well as legal.
Linelist and peace
Those in the presidential enthusiasm are already clear that nobody can't stop "feng shui" from the head office of the State.
Where it's quiet and peace.
What's right, just after the new hour without a minute (no more, no less!), the morning, when the former Sibi's edil asks the officers to present.
A usual that probably hasn't disappointed since the city's primary leadership from Cibin.
And about the fact that Johannis doesn't want television in the office, they have already been born unnumbered legends, being people from the Cotroceni Palace who have come to turn to the variant that the presidents would try to avoid his monitoring.
In particular, there's no radio camera.
Only in this rythm, it should be meditating how hard it is in darkness, because the illuminate devices can also hide audio-video recording technology.
Just good.
Another strangeness from the Cotroceni Palace is the deliverance to the head of the State only of the "pzoitive monitoring" of the president's activities.
I mean, if any knowledge of Klaus Johannis or his wife appears well, the head of the state will receive the prosecution of this.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that it has been prohibited to "negative monitoring" in conditions where, for example, Traian Basescu was renew, not only as the following nights of television in which he was criticized, but the question every morning, with priority, was negative stripes.
That doesn't mean that he helped him to something, but that's what the gest is important!
And at least he can't have a excuse for not being well informed of alternative sources.
Not outside or confirmed
Now, then, the mystery and the mystery why he doesn't want to watch Klaus Iohannis on TV.
However, it would be more important to solve the contractual settlement of hundreds of employees from the Presidentship, whether the formula is.
Which, in order to be able to work here, are required to sign a loyalty statement of the head of the State found in function and which must be ported and signed.
Only since December and before now, Klaus Johnnis did not sign for confirmation even half of these statements, until this had to happen in at least 30 days.
As hundreds of employees, representing over half of the staff of the Cotroceni Palace, have an uncertainty now.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of the State does not sign their declaration personally, they should be given outside.
Only that all of them haven't received any negative!
So, in one case, I can come by any accounting court inspectors, who will find that, over half the year, hundreds of people have received their loans at least somewhere at the border of the law.
That's until you decided, and the president, if he puts it out or confirms it on posts, the decision to be strict.
The authorities declared that a teenager was taking an attack against Papa Francisc during the visit in the United States
The ISIS inspired plan of a teenager to attack Papa Francisc during his visit in the United States was more "aspirational" than operative, confirmed a police source for Fox News on Tuesday.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in Philadel's area in August, when law implementation authorities dismissed the plan.
The plan is the same as Texas Representant, Mike McCaul, President of the Internal Security, stated a source for Fox News during a Wednesday interview.
"We very carefully monitor the threats against Papa for this visit in the United States," McCaul at "This Week" from ABC.
Papa Francisc was not mentioned as a specific target of the plan in a bulletin.
on the common information of the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, where youth planned to use more attackers, fire weapons and explosives, with the aim of “a foreign deminat during a high-level event”.
In the bulletin it is mentioned that the minor has been radicalized through social networks.
The teenager may suffer from a mental disease, declared a source of the law of Fox News, but without giving precise details about the disease of yours.
Moreover, on Sunday, McCaul repeated the potential for an attack from a so-called "single" at the level of the whole nation and mentioned that it was informed by the Secret Services about a "strict place" for the visit of Papea.
And that's a big security risk, so, as the time it comes, I think we'll all be very watchful and we'll protect it when he arrives to the United States.
Matt Dean from Fox News made this material.
The scale from the average period discovered in the tree suffered a violent death, say experts
Irish archaeologists discovered olu details about the strange schele of the average period, found at the root of a 215 - year - old tree.
The fashion of Collooney, Sligo, fell during a furtune that passed this year, dragging the macabra look of a schelet captured between his roots.
The Irish National Monuments Service brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archeological Services to excavate and analyze the remains, discovering such a furious powder.
"He was murdered violently," said Marion Dowd, director of the Sligo-Leitrim Archeological Services, for FoxNews.com.
On the top of the piece, he has wounds caused by knife, and he's in his hand, which suggests that he's trying to open.
The scale is of a 17-20-year-old t’arrest.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We can't know if he was killed in a fight or in a personal dispute," Dowd said, noting that he was buried after a Christian ritual, with his head towards the west.
"Providable was buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd stated for FoxNews.com that who planted the bathroom didn't know about the funeral.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual," she said.
There are history documents that prove that there is a church and a cimiter in the area, but today there are no more visible followers of them.
There is another unusual aspect of discovery: the height of the wind.
"He had 1 meter 77," Dowd says.
For the average society, that means too much.
The Federal Government spent $1.5 million to study what children think about eating
National Health Institutes (NIH) have spent approximately 1.5 million dollars by studying what small children think about food.
The project, called “The Module in which children and little food children perceive” is derulated by the University of Chicago and, now, stated that the small ones are not intended to eat linched foods of others or that they have spent others.
According to the project finance, “adequate nutrition is important for health and long-term, but many Americans have no nutritional health diet.”
There are evidence that suggests that the first food models of children and children have long-term consequences for the whole life health.
Pressure for this study is that they miss research on how children look at food.
“In spite of the complexity and significance of the food selection, children’s psychology have a little surprisingly dedicated attention to study how children and little children understand, learn and understand food, said the finance.
The current proposal applies to cognitive development methods to test the social impacts of the choice and consumption of children and children.
Researchers say about kids have "limited knowledge in food area".
Children covered between three and six years "I know more about food than children and little children", but they are "extremly moftrose consumers".
A action playing in Star Trek: Voyager is accused of indigenous exposure in Tennessee

Super boss: Six women jul between maternity and service
In contrast to any other worldwide, Papua New Guinea, in the United States, there is no centralized policy on payment of maternity.
Two weeks ago, when the executive director of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, announced that she was pregnant with men, but she was intended to take a very short consent of maternity and to “glorify in the period” of his free time, the woman of 40 years was criticized to encourage a surface culture or nothing.
But Mayer, sheself is a symbol of the top woman, to be guilty of unrealistic expectations?
How are other women leaders doing?
Seema Patel, a lawyer and adjunct director of the Office for the application of the Work Standards in San Francisco, just received a job at Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss saw her with an unusual advice.
"I don't know anything about you," she said to her boss.
But if you're going to make your family in the future, you're getting up to get your license from now on.
Patel's employee was the federal one, and she didn't even receive a day of maternity granted as part of her job contract.
At that time, Patel was unmarried and very concentrated on the career, and the family was the last thing he thought about.
But she gave her boss' advice.
She avoided using her medical consent days for four years, so when she remained pregnant with her first child, two years ago, she gathered three months of payment.
Six months ago, when he was born the second child, Patel couldn't apply the same strategy anymore.
The four months of consent that he took was totally unpaid.
Patel says she didn't feel any refus from her colleagues, but she has a problem with work.
"I seem very disappointing for anyone who trys to have a family," she says.
Send a message: Your value doesn't value the fact that you're going to be deceived.
Karen Choi, president of the Capital Group's asset administration firm, says that any employed woman who is and mother must be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month baby, describes the junk between mother quality and work as “a constant fight”.
The secret that you don't spare is to have “a unbelievable family with you” and a bone and a babysitter, accepting that there are things that you will not be the best (“not everyone can be Martha at internal threats”) and just walk through it.
Choi says he's taken a more bigger maternity grant for each child, starting from two months and half for the first and finishing six months for the last.
This makes her a chance, especially in her activity.
When your kid is sick, he's got a fever, a womb, and you're staying all night to take care of him and you know that the next morning you have to take your other children to school, and then go to work...
Then it becomes very complicated," she says.
However, her company supported her and mentioned that her investment portfolio performan had nothing to suffer.
When she entered the financial industry, after university, approximately 20 of her colleagues choose the same way, she says.
Today, approximately 90% of them have cancelled.
Women who refuse to work, then start again, have no more the same chances at the top places, she says.
It is difficult to say: "A short term is a sacrifice, but long-term results are seen."
Anyway, her children helped her give a sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that help me go further is that I want to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates her scientific researcher and Professor Kelly Posner, 48 years old.
Children know that their mother helps to save human life.
Posner, the founder and director of the Centre for Assessment of the Synucide Risk at the University of Colombia, says that it is important that women know that they can have a "measurable goal" in relation to the career and fulfill it.
It's very important that women believe that they can have a vision.
Most of them don't allow them to believe that," she says.
Once he had a presentation before the 200th, among which the officers of the officers, in Italy during a webinar, when he was pregnant in eight months.
She also helped, she said, because she could stop the car and answer the phone after she took her children or answered an e-mail.
The jongle between maternity and a requesting career has been helped by optimistic personality, inclinated to the solution of problems, she says. The ability to bring things to the end even when that seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33 years old, the Executive Director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and the mother of two children, says that to do motherhood and career to work together only through private assistant networks, such as bones, is wrong.
"You should not be lucky or win lottery to succeed," she says, describing the fashion of the system of supporting women and employment - mentioning very small salaries, the deficit sanitary system and the lips of a payable maternity grant.
"As a society, we don't care for each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of the mothers who were just born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while following the courses of the fairness, bore her child when she first was in the office.
With a husband and a child based on a medical assistant offered by the office, the leader in the field of work could take a parental grant for only two weeks and then return to the service.
Lisa Mosko, a modal stylist and two children's mother, says that less women will leave their profession if they will benefit more social extent, in the form of daily care services from companies, maintaining the programmes established by common agreement and accepting that effective work does not mean to stay over the program.
In front of the logistic constraints, says Mosko, the additional pressure is to activate in a field where being a mother is sometimes synonym with the lack of pleasure (the "mama" is one of the most serious insults).
“The picture is a part of our work, it lifts you up or draws you down, ” she explains.
Mosko's "permanent nutrition" because its multiple roles to work harmonious means to keep its aspect and a beautiful geant in m', which, however, sometimes falls another game-two.
If she remembers that even men are fathers, the company could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers as they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, the President and the Executive Director of the New York House Authority, who cares over 400 000 newyorkees and has over 11 000 employees, says that motherhood and career does not mean talking about "equilibrium".
Equality's a little inappropriate.
It looks like a balancer," she says.
Mother of three children, one of whom has only three months, she just took a seven-week maternity consent after she was born this year.
"It was a very important period for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband succeeded to take her fathership, and she succeeded to have a flexible program, meaning to go before or late, so that she could take her child.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning that ends at 6:00 a.m. ('More eftin than therapy's').
At the service, he tried to create a "friendly for parents" environment in which it is allowed to delay for a child, and the response to emails should not be sent unexpectedly from the office.
"The concept and family concept have changed and changed very much," Olatoye says.
"The family is very different from what was 25 or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one who needs to be adapted.
The Russian homorists say they've wronged Elton John about a phone from Putin.
For cines it seemed too nice to be true: a phone from Vladimir Putin, Russian President, to Sir Elton John, song and military for sexual minorities rights, to discuss homosexual rights.
Unfortunately, for John, it was not true: despite an exhaustive post on Instagram where the thanks to the Russian leader that he had addressed the problem, immediately became clear that, whoever had called him Monday night, was not Putin.
Kremlin already said he had no knowledge of that conversation.
And Wednesday, two famous Russian humorists repeated that they, not the president, were throwing out the foreign voices from the end of the conversation.
"We thought it was a little probably that Putin wanted to meet him or call him, or at least not soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague, Alex "Lexus" Stolianov, was given to the President's words, Dmitri Peskov.
"So, it seems that Elton John just waited for this phone, so he immediately believed that it was actually a conversation with the right people we gave," he said for the Comsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.
He said, "Thank you, it was the surprise of the day."
This day and this conversation were the most beautiful and greatest in my life.
As to finish John's standing, the two announced that they would publish a record of the conversation at a popular Russian nightmare.
John's reproachers did not give statements about the pharmaceutical speculations.
On the basis of the story, the comments made by the song in the weekend, in which Putin criticized his "ridicol" attitude towards homosexuals while the war for the rights of LGBT to Kiev, especially criticizing a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of the "progress for non-radiational sexual relations" between minors.
"I want to meet him [Putin], to speak," said John to BBC, saying that although the idea was "probably unrealistic", it deserved a trial.
Then, Monday evening, the song broke the disloyalty of observers when he published a message on a social network, showing that Putin answered his critics taking the phone and calling it.
He said that “he was deceived to meet [president] in front of him to discuss the equality of LGBT in Russia”.
Unfortunately, for John, Putin was not the one from the end of the line, but Stoliarow and Krasnov, known for telephones given in the glume of many Russian and Ukrainians.
Stolianov, who speaks well English, played the role of Peskov and claimed that it would be the interpreter of both.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the true Peskov told the journalists on Tuesday that Putin would have "previously meet Elton John and answer all the questions," but Kremlin had no such request from the song.
Kremlin had reasons to doubt the position of Instagram, he added, "is more especially because it is not written entirely in a correct English".
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written with the same grammatic errors.
Before the Russian duty declared his public pharmaceutical, local media channels were already baptized that John was the victim of a ghost.
Some online users will identify it as a guilty of Krasnov, for the cars made by the phone politicians that they register and place on its YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Telephone calls to publics, then the publication of records has become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliaров, which is considered as the initiator of this kind, deceived his talent to make the Ukrainian politicians fashion.
He was interviewed at the Ukrainian TV by imitating Anton Gerashchenko, the direct minister of the Internal Minister, Arsen Avakov.
He so well imitated Gerashchenko that last year he talked to the former Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomoski, better than six hours in more days.
Krasnov became after the parliamentary elections of 2011, which led to massive street protests after massive fraud reports.
Given Arkadi Dvorkovich, President of Dmitri Medvedev since then, convinced the President of the Electoral Commission, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to grant it.
In the lake many Russian celebrations, among his victims, the former president URSS Mihail Gorbaciov, the chief of Kiev, and the campaign at Vitali Klitschko box and the Russian minister of the Vitali Mutko sports, whom he sent to ask for excuse for his behavious behaviour of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called the president of Belarus Aleksandr Lukaşenko, giving himself to the son of the Ukrainian leader demis, Viktor Ianukovici.
He was so convinced that the one from the other end, whose voice like Lukaşenko, offered asyl.
John's initial affair that she would like to talk to Putin caused a big reaction in Russia.
Legal Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the "propaganda" law, said to the Guardian that John should not defer Putin with a "inevitable subject" and was ready to meet him with the song to explain his position in Russia.
The Moskovsky Comsomolets reported a online survey for readers, where 39% of the respondents thought that Putin and John should meet, and 22% considered that such meeting would give Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die because of air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, more than 3 million people per year die preliminaryly because of the outer air pollution, more than malary and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, represents a wood and carbone burning for the heating of the habitats and for the heating, but the research shows that such an alarmant reason is the agricultural aspects of Europe and the United States, where the main reason for those dead.
The report warns that if no measures are taken, the number of dead - already equal to six dead per minute - will duplicate in 2050.
"These projects should draw a signal of alarm for public health agencies worldwide," said Professor Michael Jerrett, an expert in the health of the environment at the University of California, which was not involved in research.
The most of the dead caused by the rain of the air are caused by small parts, which can be deeply inhaled in the flames.
They cause infarct and brain attacks, which are for three quarters of the 3.3 million deaths annually, while the rest is caused by cancer on flames and respiratory diseases.
The investigation did not include the effects of the internal air pollution, for example from the fires for ≥ 3,4 million deaths per year.
The new study, published in the Nature Journal, is the first that evidenced various sources of air pollution outside and estimated the number of preliminary deaths caused by them, taking into account the road traffic, the centres based on fossil fuel and other sources.
Researchers used a detailed model of global atmosphere to evaluate the impact of air pollution of different populations, including new information on how it affects the pollution of China and India.
A third of all premature deaths was the result of the use of smoke fuel, such as the tree and carbone, for the heating of the habitats or the heating, and of the use of the generation of murderous diesel for electricity, all of them are the new dangers.
The consumption of this type of internal energy causes half of the 645 000 annual dead in India and a third of the 1.4 million annual dead in China.
However, the research discovered that the agriculture of amonics had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld from the Chimic Max Planck Institute in Germany, who led the research.
A five of the dead at the global level are caused by these lusts, mainly from animals, birds and wheat, and from the use of grapes.
Ammonia reacts to trading and industry disappearing gases and produce small parts, as the main reason for the dead because of east air pollution from the United States, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," Lelieveld says.
In the whole of the United Kingdom, 48% of the early deaths were the result of agricultural damage.
Trade-generated powder is still an important factor in deceased countries, which causes a five of the dead, despite measures against poultry vehicles.
This only caused 5% of the dead at the global level, but the number could increase as much as more cars appear on the streets in the countries in decency.
The air pollution by the centrals, especially those working with carburants, was significant at the global level, providing one of the seven dead.
In the United States, it is the main factor, which causes a third of the 55 000 annual dead, compared to 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air powder, especially in the dry regions and with a lot of dust, caused nearly a fifth between the dead at the global level caused by air pollution.
This source represents a major factor in some dry countries, which is 92% of the dead in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"The surprise between the high degree of poultry and the large number of residents tells its word of public health, but it doesn't know anymore about the sources of destruction for premature deaths," says Jerrett.
Realities are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health at global level.
Today, it is assumed that all particulates are the same toxicity.
However, if those caused by burning of fuel are more toxic, as some scientists, the percent of early deaths that could be assigned to agricultures would be less.
Even so, Jerrett states, “the discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not been generally seen as a major source of pollution of air or premature death and suggests that there is much more attention to agricultural sources, both of science and political people.”
Dr. Oliver Wild, specialist in the atmosphere at the Lancaster University of the United Kingdom, said: “The study even highlights the need for air quality control, to avoid these dead, especially in the very popular areas of Asia.”
A statement of Victor Ponta stresses and more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lies, the first Roman speaks of attitudes that remind nazism
Relations with Hungary, already stressed after the announcement of the construction of a guard at the border with Romania, after the frontier of Sarba, have a new depreciation following the statements made by Prime Victor Ponta, who charged the authorities of Budapest to treat them "with battle and inserted".
Hungarian diplomaties have hardly reacted talking about "extremists and lies", but Victor Ponta hasn't left any more and has accused officials in the neighbourhood that I'm "a Russian" for Europe.
Notice that it is not for the first time Ponta trys to intensify Roman-unging relations through delicate or electoral statements.
Everything started from a statement made on Monday by Victor Ponta, in which he tried to argument that Romania could not receive more than 1.800 repeat.
Your problem with our logistics to treat those people as some people, not as he treats our earlier earlier, with battle and inserted.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu put himself in front of a hated and horrible feeling that exists in all society, namely a xenofob feeling.
It's very good to do a debate, but we're going to take the job to solve the problem.
"We'll treat those people like us," said Monday Victor Ponta, quoted by the truth.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta mentioned when he spoke about the insertion of repeateds, but the Czech Republic was recently in the center of criticisms after writing numbers on the hands of migrants found in more trains, in a guest who remembered the procedure used by nazis to identify Jewish prisoners in concentration lagars.
Peter Ssiejarto, according to the Hungarian MTI Science Agency, received by magyaridok.hu, as probably the internal political crisis that had deteriorated Victor Ponta's position, makes it to make the "extremists and false statements".
The Roman injury from Budapest was convocated to offer explanations, reported Mediafax, quoting MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inadequate statements on how Hungary has managed the crisis of immigrants," the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated.
Levente Magyar, State Secretary for External Comert and External Affairs in Hungarian MAE, expressed "surprending" in relation to "Victor Ponta's constant trials to save its converse moral position by anti-ungeous lies", highlights the diplomacy of Budapest.
"I don't want to reply to the challenges coming from outermost representatives - but read the report below and you'll understand the indignation I feel like men and European citizens, the girl of mentalities and attitudes that Europe has seen only in the 1930-40!!", wrote Ponta on Facebook account.
He stresses that, as other European politicians, he has the "obligation" to attach attention and sanctify "the constant behaviour of officials at the highest level of Hungary" which are "a Russian for the Culture and the Values of the European Union" through "the antisemital" attitudes, "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the crisis of re-seeds!"
"Sarma gimpata, aggressive laws, prisoners and brutality will not solve the problem - they will only look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, are political decisions with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other stronger than those who have fled these repeateds!", accused Ponta, saying that he believes in "solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values", and "what we see in Hungary in the last days is totally contradiction with these objectives and values!"
During the series, Ponta was invited to Antena 3, where the main subject constituted it Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta asked what would happen if the exhibition military would take up or kill some kids or women, in a speech in which he made more references to nazism.
In the dispute, UDMR President, Kelemen Hunor, who considers that Roman authorities should not have a "sensitive deal" in relation to Hungary's intention to build a guard at the border.
The leader of UDMR must understand that this solution is not directed against Romania or Romanian citizens, he insists that the guard could even help us to not become a intense transit path of the ships that will reach Schengen, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to subline, to say, that we don't have to histerize, we take all of this as something contrary to Romania and don't have to be used to worry about what the relations are not very good from the two, because it's not the case.
I think any emotional attraction is not okay.
"We must see the rational part, see why we have come here and we have to know and say this, because it is not our opposite, it is not against Romania, Romanian citizens, and does not prevent freedom between the two states, within the EU," said Kelemen Hunor.
The West ignored Russia's offer to introduce Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership in 2012
Russia proposed more than three years ago the initiation of the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, as part of a peace agreement, in accordance with an official higher involved at that time in negotiations between the provinces and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
The President of Finland and Lauried of the Nobel Prince for Peace, Martti Ahtisaari, declared that western powers have not benefited from the proposal since.
Since 2012 until now, tens of thousands of people died and other millions were needed to escape from the torah, giving birth to the most serious crisis of reactions from the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari took discussions with the representatives of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (USA, United Kingdom, France, Russian Federation and China) in February 2012.
It further stated that during the discussions, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, offered a plan that included among others and the proposal from Assad to renew power at a given time, after the start of peace treaties between the regime and opposition.
He proposed three things:
One - we don't have to wear the opposition.
Two - we need to start a dialogue between Assad and the opposition immediately.
"Tree - we have to look for an elegant way to make Assad retreat," Ahtisaari said, reporting the position of the Russian ambassador.
However, he said further to Ahtisaari, the United States, the Great Britain and France, they were so convinced that the Syrian dictator was going to fall, while they ignored the proposal of the Russian ambassador.
"It was a lost opportunity in 2012," continued the former President of Finland.
Officially, Russia continued to firm Bashar al-Assad for the four and half years of war, insisting that it cannot represent a proposal in no peace agreement.
Assad thinks Russia will never leave him.
Moscova recently started sending flight tanks, and military equipment to Syria, in an effort to establish the regime of Assad and to overcome the extremists of the Islamic State.

The reports show that the population of animals and sea plants have sealed in the last 40 years
The scale of the crisis with which animals and sea plants are documented in a study that shows that sea species around the world, including the essential for human food, are in a decline that may be a disaster.
Pressions without more directions at the global ocean eco's level are combined and create a series of difficulties for almost all sea's lives, says the WWF's report.
Coral receipts are subject to serious decline risks (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and seasons, which depend on many other species, have recorded a significant decline, while the whole population of fish with commercial value, such as the macro and the tonne, has decreased with three sferts towards the 1970s, shows the report.
Many coral recepts, usually described as tropical forests of the oceans due to their biological diversity, could be threatened with the extinction of this half century if the ocean acid continues to grow as a result of the increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere, which causes a proportional increase in the sea carbonic acid level.
"The healthy seas represent an extraordinary source of beautifulness and natural surprise and also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," Louise Heaps, the leader of marine policies in WWF-UK, contributed to the implementation of the report.
"In the fishing in ́s, which deteriorate the coast habitats, and without solving the global heating problem, we like the seeds of a economic disaster," says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of the scientific issue published, but also on the Indices of the living planet, is one of the most detailed studies of sea life ever undertaken.
Almost 20% of the total areas of mangroves divorced between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) This researched a large variety of marine species, fish, marine tissues and sea castravetes - a animal similar to a wheat, with aspra skin - pı on sea plants such as mangroves and alge.
The report discovered that the algeous areas were decreased by nearly 30% in the last century, while the total of mangrove areas was decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of crevet fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
During a single generation, human activity caused great damage to the ocean, taking fish faster than it can be reproduced and also taking them into account.
Deep changes are needed to ensure a abundant ocean life in the following generations," said Marco Lambertini, WWF General Director.
Some of the most dramatic declines have been registered in the fishing species for commercial benefits.
For example, 58 populations from 17 species belonging to Scrombidae - macrou, ton and sardin - have decreased by 74 per cent between 1970 and 2010, without giving signs of recovery, states the report.
We are in a course of fishing that could end with people from a vital food source and a essential economic engine.
Fisheries, the destruction of marine habitats and climate changes have serious consequences for all human populations, and the poor communities based on sea will be killed as quickly and strongly," Lambertini said.
"The colapse of the ocean eco's could cause a serious economic decline and could undermine our fight to eradicate poverty and subnutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, Scientific Director of ZL, said: "These alarming numbers prove how quickly people change plants and animals in the ocean and represent a clear warning about the problems we could face as a result."
Sea trailer: extended submarines "paws", which catch the seats rich in minerals and stabilize the sea's floor.
Over the last century, the surface of the copper was decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: exists in 123 countries, almost half of the total surface, representing only five countries.
Approximately 20% of the total mangrove areas divorced between 1980 and 2005, mainly because of human invasion.
Coral recepts: some of the richest and most productive habitats on the earth.
A sfert of the whole sea species lives in coral recepts or near them, but three quarters of them are currently threatened and many can disappear over this century if the ocean acid continues to grow.
Inhabitants in the landscape: very few are known about the closer ocean areas, but the decline of the quantity of fish captured in these inaccessible places in the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by marine changes at the global level.
Steven Gerrard's racist accusations that would have been brought to him by his former companion from Liverpool, El-Hadji Diouf
A passenger from his autobiografie is working "My Story", serialised by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes the Senegalez player saying that "is not really interested in the ball" and that it is the colleague who has been "the least" in the 17 years passed to the club.
As a reaction, Diouf would have answered Gerrard to the senegalez Group Futurs Medias radio post, quoted to the attackant, which would be said that “Gerrard never had his colors.”
Gerrard's lawyers refused any accusation of racism.
In his latest book, Gerrard, who has made himself public and before the bad appearance of Diouf, criticized his former colleague's attitude and degree of professionalism.
"I don't want to lose my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his irosed seasons in Liverpool as examples of how things can go down," he wrote.
"I think Diouf is not really interested in the ball and that he doesn't care about Liverpool," he continued.
For example, the way a big and witchful flegma in a Celtic fan in a Uefa Cupa from Parkhead in March 2003 represents a evidence of his disrespectful and ranchunous behavior.
Diouf proved a conversed figure all the time passed on Anfield, his most famous night in Celtic Park.
The senegalez forward was asked by the police after the scrap episode and modified with the contravalor of his salary for two weeks in the club, a number of 60,000 lires is given to a humanitarian organization at Celtic's election.
In his previous autobiografie, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as a mild and egoist.
"His attitude was completely wrong," then Gerrard wrote.
I felt that it wasn't ready to make all the effort to help Liverpool back to top.
Diouf, who now plays in the Malaysian Sabah club, criticized Gerrard in public, and attacked Gerrard's old friend and companion, Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerrard “egoist” and claimed that no one of Anfield likes the player who led the team to the victory of the Campions Liga in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted by saying that Gerrard is “zelous”.
He said: “Gerrard is just zealous for me.
He didn't touch the results I had in the ball.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the boss, and he lives there.
I am respected in the world of Bal, the biggest experts in the Baltics have stuck me among the first seven players in the World Campionship and among the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't feel apartment.
I'm going to other countries, I'm venerated, while Gerrard is hot as long as he goes out of his hometown Liverpool.
From the hero the professional dancer: the fast way to Alek Skarlatos spread "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Skarlatos does not play only the role of the hero in uniform.
It is also a t'arrest, attractive and athletic type, in the same measure discreet and modern, say producers.
"Buying many categories and we always look for it on the most popular moment," Deena Katz, co-producer of the ABC spectacle.
I swear he'll have his printer after that.
It's crazy.
He's got something special.
Before being competitive to the famous spectacle - but only a few weeks ago - Scarlatos arrived in the international pressure after he took a great danger.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, immobilized a guy armed with a AK-47 in a train full of traveling from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what could be a murder in the table by a possible terrorist.
Following that, Skarlatos, 22 years old, was a conscience in the Nacional Army, who grew close to Sacramento, received a phone from President Obama, a Twitter message from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and French.
Although a few local appreciations - Friday, in Sacramento, it has occurred a paradise in the honour of the t́r - it has not been expected to such positive reactions or to the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"Nothing in a million years I would have thought I would have received this offer," Scarlatos witnessed on Saturday, in a break from the dance repeat with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything looks new and I can't.
Although before the Monday spectacle, he repeated that he was "easy emotional", he became a professional at his first foxtrot, obtaining points that brought him almost in the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who made the jury, said he offered one of the best representations of the series.
Katz and the executive manufacturer from "DWTS" Rob Wade said that they wanted to keep a free place in the spectacle for concurrents invited to the last hundred meters, such as Skarlatos, who grew up in the eyes of the public.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends in the vacation, who had a gun attack in a train with 500 passengers and immediately thought to invite one of them to dance.
He looked for social networks, found family members and sent messages to Scarlatos.
When it arrived in the "God Morning America" to tell the incident during which Stone and other passengers were hurt, Katz worked with the ABC-time program to avoid walking through all the media bars.
He supported his "five-minute floor", then waited unfortunately to find out if Skarlatos would accept to participate in "DWTS".
"A while everything was very uncertain, because that's so disappointed why he does," Katz witnessed.
I was a little late fighting in Afghanistan, and now I asked him if he had a dance manager.
Skarlatos, who is in a short consent from the Nacional Guard, had not even seen a whole spectacle soon.
Ezita to participate, mainly because he didn't want to be just he got out in evidence.
Emission couldn't invite all three friends.
However, producers had a ass in the hand: Noah Galloway, war veteran, with the hand and the amputated foot.
These encouraged Scarlatos to call Galloway, the favorite competitor of fans and finalist of the past season, and ask him about his experience.
It probably was the critical point, together with Katz's unrecommended "super-speaking" and "instant messages", she said.
"Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army will be presented and how the picture of my friends will be protected," Scarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So after that conversation, I accepted.
Scarlatos, a big lover of sport and history, never danced anymore, and Arnold witnessed in interviews that he tried to make him relax and reject the military position quite strict.
But Katz says it's confident that it's gonna be adapted and that spectators will respond positively.
He will receive much love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and what he did.
"How do you not support him?" said Katz.
But that's gonna take only a few weeks.
To go further, I have to dance.
Scarlatos, who's a bullshit and wants to be a cop, says that, now, he's in this whole environment of us.
The program represented the worst fight, which often needed to travel to Los Angeles between the moments in which it was called in the media and the various primary ceremonies.
He said at the end of August, when he returned to the United States immediately after the train incident, he wanted to relax with his family.
"This was about a day and a half," he said.
Totally, I've been home four days.
There is a risk in achieving a media care, but it is not usual to be in reflectors, said the executive manufacturer Wade.
And the competitor wants to make sure that the competitor is running, and it does.
"The pressure is big and we want the participants to have an experience," Wade said.
"I don't want Alek to say, "Aoleu, what am I laughing?"
Let's keep the pumps on them.
McRib from McDonald's return.
It's time for those who hold the whole year sandwich with sweet meat in the form of a mini-coast to be done.
But what's more difficult to find this year?
The NCBC reports that only 55% of McDonald's francises offer this season speciality.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served the McRib sandwich.
"The promotion of McRib in 2015 is part of approximately 8000 restaurants," stated McDonald's words, Lisa McComb, for The Times in a mail.
In the United States there are at least 14 300 restaurants of this fast-food.
But, according to McComb, the individual owners of the French decide whether they will serve or not McRib.
"The participation is not significantly different from last year," McComb said.
The owners/operators are free to offer the menu that they think they want their local customers.
And if you still wonder what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain the ingredients last year, with a videoclip to show reality.
According to the videoclip, the McRib sandwich is prepared of sweet meat, water, decoration and conservants.
The sandwich will be at the end of the year, at the McDonald's restaurants that participate.
There is also a website with locations in which McRib is served (unaffiliated at McDonald's), which may be useful.
People can report on the website if they find restaurants with McRib and can search for the nearest place where this sandwich is served.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the closest restaurant with McRib de Los Angeles is located in Sebastopol in Somma County, discovered last Sunday by Aidan Briggsonian.

Keith Richards understands that new Rolling Stones records would be prepared.
Keith Richards is again in reflectors with a new single album and a appearance in a documentary, but, soon, and the other members of Rolling Stones could be joined in the study.
Richards announced that he and the others from Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood recently met in London and made "clear recording plans", as he says.
Tuesday night, Richards spoke in the ICONS series from iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A potential new album from Stones would be the first LP after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But it wasn't even inactive.
In recent years, they had many stadium tours and sang in more small concerts in L.A., among which representations in Echoplex and the Theatre Fund.
In the last of these, they reinterpretated the classic LP in 1971, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular, Richards was occupied this year, cooperating with the documentary “Keith Richards: Under the Influence” programed to be launched on Netflix on September 18th.
This year, only "Crosseyed Heart", his third only in a five decades carrier.
Randy Lewis from The Times described Richards' new album in an earlier interview with the chist: “Surely, Richards' voice is always a more friendly instrument than different...”.
But Richards' feelings are overwhelmed in all the 15 melodies of the album, and that always means the rock 'n' role.
In the interview, Richards states that she's going to get into the studio most likely after the South American tour from the beginning of the next year.
He did not give other details, but, judgeing after the last concerts, it is still very full of life.
Film Festival from Toronto: Jason Bateman about childhood, maturity and “The Family Fang”
Jason Bateman has already passed through some difficult transitions in his career, with a discrete pharmacist who made them look much easier than they were actually.
Some actor child in televisions such as "Silver Spoons", as adults, reformed in the role of a typical inexpressive in the "Crise Situation" series and in movies such as "Cosmar Chiefs".
The first movie on which he worked as a director was a very acid comdy "Bad Words", in which he played.
The film was nominated at the International Film Festival from Toronto in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with the "The Family Fang", the second film that he regained, a ambitional film in tonnel view, adaptation of Kevin Wilson's popular Roman 2011. The scenario is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, the winner of the Pulitzer Price, and in the film playing Nicole Kidman and Bateman, in the role of the brothers with problems.
The film has a festival that looks for American distribution.
Many reviews of the book have considered it a comedy with powerful emotional tents; the film reinterprets the poet, putting the accent more on its dramatic, darkest side.
An interview granted to our publication on Tuesday, Bateman says he always considered the book a more drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen this book," he witnessed.
In the book, the subject and the subjects are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin had a very fun topic in a very funny way.
So that was always the way I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and excitement.
The world's first Monday evening benefited from introduction by the Festival Programme Director, Kerri ́ddock, who expressed its enthusiasm especially towards the Hogan Family Sitema from the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, which Bateman worked. "I have not met too many fans Hogan Family," Bateman said sec when he went on the scene.
However, the few episodes that he regained from that site brought Bateman, now 46 years old, in Directors Guild at 18 years of age.
His new film story has a family named Fang in the center.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Pluōtt), are artists with a medium-reputation, known best for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their spectacles, for example, by putting on the way a jaf with the lusts or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At matureness, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) are trying to identify their own identity.
Annie is acting with some mistakes, although it is renamed more than for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is romantic and journalist of magazines trying to reach famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear in mysterious circumstances, Annie and Baxter are aware that it's just another truck of them and try to discover the truth about their parents and make new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to observe what of the babies of children who want to develop in adult lives reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very atypical," Bateman declares.
I started the action when I was 10 years old, with parents as managers, and this movie has many elements that overcome the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and active.
"It's a powder that I feel connected and I understand in profusion," he added, "and, even though I didn't try to join it my personal experience, I knew very clearly how to show this movie to represent children with a non-radiational childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and she was the producer of the film, who got the rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write himself adjustment, he was co-operated with Lindsay-Abaire, who adapted his own part "Reality Trace" in which Kidman played.
Bateman testifies that he accepted the chance of regaining the movie and playing in it.
(Kidman, now on the scene in London in the production "Photograph 51", did not participate in the first moon.
The bookbuilder was public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman's movie "intelligent and caustic adjustment" which "too exploited by the genuine diffusion family and separated the mission, sometimes from a life, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be funny and sweet, incisive and usually very dark."
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very asper portrait" and said that Bateman "proofs visible progress and a greater maturity as a film manager with this smart adaptation, but never too fair or mechanical".
According to the Monday project, when Bateman and Walken went up to the scene for the question session, the public evasionated his department on the Walken Multilevit.
About Bateman as a director and actor, Walken said during the question session that “I was impressed every day.
I wasn't coming to believe the easily with which they changed the work of the film recorder, which is very difficult, and the actor in scenes.
His concentration is, indeed, we know.
A certain scene of dialogue, Bateman is on a scale in the family home behind the frame, hidden in the neighborhood, just a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and sees more clearly.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman's actor talking to Bateman's director about the fact that he can't be seen.
"I seem incredibly interesting to regain movies," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I'm never taking them to benefit me as actor.
To have a privileged position to be the one with the creation of the whole experience for the public, not only one instrument in that orchestra, being actor, it's a complete thing.
Make it matter that that... the actor wants a pre-plan.
At the question and answer session, Bateman witnessed that after reading the scenario, he immediately thought at Walken for Caleb's role, but also on the composer Carter Burwell for the sound column.
Known mainly for friendship with brothers Coen, Burwell composed the sound column for two other films presented at the festival of Toronto: the animation film "Anomalisa" - a story of love and isolation registered by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Gangsters de legenda", interpretation of Brian Helgeland about the English gangsters in the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell also built the sound column for Todd Haynes' film.
"I look very interesting in the tonnes with alunged or obtuous tons," says Bateman, giving more interpretations on Tuesday.
To navigate between these tonalities and guide the harmonious public and something elegant from a ton to the next, through the movie.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation that can navigate between the most complicated tons.
With the "The Family Fang", Bateman made a further step, both as a director and as an actor, in a dominated carriage of recovery and decision, a commodity and drama mixture, and darkness and darkness.
As Bateman witnessed when he finished his film introduction to the first Monday, "Okay, badly, he went out exactly as I wanted."
The Festival is like the Oscaruris about Boston Globe investigation about pedophile priests
Did you win $240,000 on the lottery?
A ticket at X-LOTTO value of over $240,000 is unrevenied for a month.
The unregistred ticket at the X-Lotto extraction was bought by the Ingle Farm Shopping Centre from Montague Rd, Saturday, 15 August.
In addition to the winner picture sold in the South, 16 other winner entries have been recorded in all, which shared their only estimated X-Lotto first fund by 4 million dollars.
SA Lotteries-Roa-All who bought tickets at X-Lotto from English Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the X-Lotto extraction on Saturday, 15 August, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, the English Farm Lotteries Kiosk manager, says he's deceived to receive the good news that he who won the big prize has checked his picture at X-Lotto.
"We have tried to spread the news, for one is our winner, and he doesn't have any idea," she said.
Criminal detectives percheck the house on the Beadell Street, Burton, where the last time the man was seen, Daniel Hind.
Hind's sister, Chelsea Hind, said it's frustrating to stay attaining information about her divorced brother, especially because the police offered two versions of this night when it was seen last time.
Her family asked the police to survive residents still since her brother's disappearance.
"I hope they'd investigate the house, I wasn't informed that they would do it," she said.
Ms. Hind says that her family wanted to also, that those who knew what she had done with her brother would talk and say the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four children, and we have many other members of the life, and half of us, we think he's alive somewhere, and the other half of us think it's not.
Anyway, we want him home and end the stories.
In 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 km from the road
In 2022, Bulgarian plans to build 635 kilometers of new roads and repair 17,000 km of existing main and secondary roads.
The end of the works for the Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Calotina, which are part of pan-European transport corridors, is counted among the priorities of the design plan for the approved school infrastructure on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable sex infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it in the European transport network, but also to ensure an efficient transport management on sexes, stated.
Bulgaria is a transit for the trade of cultural goods in Syria
According to the Ministry of Internal Ruyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit for the illegal trade of cultural goods stolen in the Middle East, due to its geografic width.
During a discussion held on Wednesday at a conference on the fight against the leading of the Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova reminded that Bulgaria's national legislation was repealed to comply with the new context, putting the focus on the prohibition of the cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Presse Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of Internal Units, in particular the General Direction for the Conflict against Organizated Crime (GDBOP) were focused on the prevention and illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
It stated that Bulgaria is a rich story, which recent studies have placed on the third place, after Italy and Greece, in the scope of the trade of objects and cultural goods.
Bulgaria's Internal Minister has more claimed that the trade of cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites in the areas such as Iraq and Syria represents a phenomenon that enlarged, described as a extremely serious war crime.
He stressed the need for concerted and decision-making measures to stop the intended destruction of the history.
Director-General UNESCO, Irina Bokova, said that films of the illegal archaeological excaves in Syria demonstrate that the jaf is affected by industrial scale.
Participants at the Conference of Wednesday have repeated that Syria's cultural inheritance is seriously in danger and that the international community must be united to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods from the war.
Rocketdyne Airport says that the new AR-1 engine program could be modified
March, Rocketdyne Holdings Inc Airport stated that it was impossible to finish the new AR-1 p' racket engine in 2019 to replace a Russian engine that will be forbidden soon, but the date could be modified if it did not receive enough funds from the United States.
Vice-President Airport, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to give statements about the fact that the Airport offered 2 billion USD to buy United Launch Alliance (ULA), a mixed company with equal actions for the Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co racket launching.
Analysers say that the requested amount is a strategic movement of the Airport to overcome its Blue Origin Rival, a company holding the founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, which develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for his new Vulcan racket.
ULA says the Blue Origin engine program is nearly two years before the aircraft AR-1 engine, a contrary to which the airport is contrary.
The work on new engines became priority after the US legislators adopted a prohibition on the use of Russian engines RD-180 for the launch of American military satellites or spying, after an attachment to Ukraine crime region from Russia last year.
Van Kleeck shows that Aeroiet tests engine hardware equipment, which is designed with tridimensional printed parts to fit both in the ULA Atlas 5 racket, now feed by the RD-180 engine, as well as in the new Vulcan racket that develops ULA and costs approximately $1 billion.
The aircraft appears that it will be less dangerous and less riskant to integrate its engine into the Atlas 5 racket than to develop a new engine and a full racket, as it is currently going to do with ULA.
Van Kleeck states that the Airport planned the start of the lar-scale engine test in 2017, followed by the receipt of the certificate in 2019, but the date could be delayed when the company does not receive sufficient funds from the Air Forces in contracts held at the end of the first half of the 2016 fiscal year, which begins in October.
It is more aware that the company's whole company was unnecessary to see how the Air Forces would share a financial amount of approximately 160 million USD between rival competitors.
He also said that the Aeroiet was thinking to try other financial options for the engine, but he did not provide details.
Competition from the Air Forces is a public-private partnership and each of the providers must provide a third of the finance, and the Air Forces cover two thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies (Space Exploration Technology), or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both as private companies, have self-financed the engine creation process and say it does not look for unexpected finance.
Beer-producing company AB InBev intends a fusion of 275 billion USD with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the biggest beer producer company in the world, took up the SABMiller Rival company (SAB.L) regarding a collection that would form a coloss that would produce a third of the total amount of beer worldwide.
Such fusion would have a market value of approximately 275 billion USD at the current prices and would combine the domination of AB InBev' in Latin America with the SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with a rapid decade, but with their beer manufactures in Asia.
"The true attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also a few places in Asia and Latin America," said the analyz Andrew Holland from the General Society.
AB InBev and other top beer producers are trying to enter into new markets and strengthen their weak points in North America and Europe, where consumers prefer more beer produced by indigenous players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, the company located in two world places and the producer of more than 200 beer marks, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, stated Wednesday that it was informed of the purpose of AB InBev to offer it, which must be held lately on 14 October, in accordance with British laws.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors confirmed the advancement.
3G, renamed for its policy to reduce the costs on the marketing socket, orchestrated previously the Burger King acquisition, the Ketchup Heinz producer (KHC.O) and the Foods force.
A suitable source of SAB said it was too early to say what it would do, since they did not have any offer.
"In this moment, we are at the stage of waiting and decideing," said the source.
Speculations regarding a merger, which would most likely be worried about the breach of market competition rules such as the United States and China, have been spent for more years.
The time of advance, after a decade of purchases made by AB InBev, follows by a decrease of approximately 15% of the SABMiller share price starting from August.
"This is exactly the time they waited," advised an analysis Phil Gorham from Morningstar.
From the financial point, for the first time in many years, he has logic.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds (62 USD) for SAB Miller action, may even 45 pounds, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of 130 billion USD, which would also include the SABMiller duty.
This would make the most significant M&A transaction of 2015, which has already been announced a year after the 2008 financial crisis from the sum of the transaction, and one of the largest acquisitions in 1980.
SAB actions reached 19.9% to 36.14 lires, giving them a burst capitalization of 90 billion USD.
AB InBev actions reached 6.4%.
Rivalii Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) assured that SAB could search for other fusions as an appeal strategy, as it did in the year when it offered to buy Heineken, but it did not succeed.
Since then, the African battler has combined his cooking glass with Coca-Cola (KO.N), and in the last weeks, there was a banai of a combination with Diageo or a Australian coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
The global market share of AB InBev, Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was in 2014 21,1%, while SABMiller was 15%, according to Plato Logic industry experts.
AB InBev intends a report between net debt and brutal profit (EBITDA) two times from the current 2.5.
It is possible to reach the goal in 2016, the realistic date to which the transaction could be completed, so it would have how to loan to finance an acquisition.
When he bought Budweiser producer company, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with 52 billion USDs, the largest ice money purchased at that time. He allowed the report to grow up to more than 5 times.
A walk like this would allow them to accumulate a obligation of 100 billion.
AB InBev families have fewer than half of the company, while the two main shareholders from SABMiller are the other cigarette manufacturer (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, otheria refused to give statements about the fact that AB InBev had been addressed, but on 9 September, the financial director, Billy Gifford, said within a analysis conference that it regularly evaluated the investment in SABMiller and that “on this occasion we consider that the maintenance of assets is in our shareholders”.
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, the leader for European investment, equity at Allianz Global Investors, who holds action in both companies, says that AB InBev has been confronted with a more larger pressure to return the numbering to the shareholders.
ABI pays a very large price, but the cumulation of income from small debts reaches somewhere at approximately 15%.
But we believe that the profit from this acquisition would be a disappointing percentage, 8%, after 10 years," Dwane said.
In any combination, there are significant weights relating to the violation of competition rules, especially in the United States, where companies have approximately 70% of the beer market.
"The economics that could be done to distribution operations are large, and the funds related to distortion of competition rules are even greater," Erik Gordon, professor at the A Ross School at the University of Michigan.
Such transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 percent of the company in participation held by SABMiller in accordance with the operational agreement.
A change in control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to get 8% more and call a new executive director of the company.
Molson, with the seat in Denver, would have the right to the first and last offer for the rest of 50 percent.
A Molson's word carrier refused to comment if the company was interested in a license, but Molson's actions increased with more than 12 percent, at their greatest value.
Any merger could also have to sell action in China, where the market leader is the association in the participation of SABMiller CR Snow with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao in China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that the combined group could hold 28% of the global market.
AB InBev is held by Lazard, and SABMiller is held by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistanian police accuses an ex pilot of the Air Forces that he would have helped Qaeda
The Pakistanian police arrested a former pilot of the Air Forces, which would have been granted further funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, stated on Wednesday police officers for Re日s, in a rare case that refers to those who contribute to the financial aid of activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was held in the Southern town of Karachi.
It paid for the treatment of the vulnerable Taliban soldiers, at a hospital in East Lahore, the police declared.
It also influenced two soldiers involved in more months in an attack of a bus with members of the Muslim minority and the Ismaelians, who died 45 of them, declared for journalists the high police officer Naveed Khawaja from the Department for the Battle of the province's terrorism.
It will be accused of the finance of terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has more financed the Afghanistan Talibans, we are still investigating to see if he has provided financial assistance through his activities or behind him there is someone else," said the officer.
"Achmed also offered more financial aid for AQIS," said, referring to the Al Qaeda Organization of the Indian Subcontinent, a ram of Al Qaeda based a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for the Pakistanian police forces, which is contrary to activism, corruption and crime.
After, in December, the Taliban puzzles massacrated approximately 150, in most of the children, at a military school, the soldier swore to get the activism.
There have been hard attacks, while the army has also gone further in tribes outside the law of the border with Afghanistan.
But military groups have a amendment and many have appeals from Pakistan towns under control of very weak police forces and insufficient funds.
Ahmed, 52 years old, was usually preaching to a moschee in the good area of the Carachi Locations Authority.
His public prejudices were moderate, but, in particular, encouraged the radicalism, the police declared.
He studied at the Pakistan Air Forces College in Sargodha and spent the Pakistan Air Forces in 1998, declared another official of security for Reʹs under anonymity.
Later, he entered the VP and chemicals industry.
Rapper Rick Ross rejected the author rights request for "Everyday I'm rights"
Newyorkez Rick Ross can't recompense his author rights for the words "Everyday I'm justtlin"," a American judge decided, refusing to complain against the LMFAO musical group, who sold tricks with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflin".
A decision published on Tuesday by the Federal Court of Miami, the District Judge Kathleen Williams said that Ross' slogan, a prominent part of his early hit in 2006, “Hustlin”, is a short expression for which the courts have mentioned more times that they cannot receive author rights.
Williams' judicial decision weakens the process for the violation of author rights that Ross, whose real name is William Roberts II, did against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the electropop of Los Angeles, located by Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin" for their own famous melodie in 2010, "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shufflin".
The hip hop star said that LMFAO melodia is “a manifest trial to capitalize fame and success of Hustlin's melodie”.
He also gave Kia Motors in court for the use of the "Party Rock Anthem" melodie in a public campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright, selling tricks and other products with the shufflin slogan.
In the judgment of Tuesday, Williams says "Hustlin", as a melodie, is protected by copyright law.
But Ross' three word slogan is locked out of usual words and can't have author rights, she did.
The Judge compared him with other famous verses of music in the past, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh", "hola back" and "we get it poppin", saying that it is "a short expression, which all courts have declared it in uniformity as impossible to place under author rights".
The judge did not decide whether LMFAO's melodia is an unselfish copy of Hustlin.
The process is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO lawyers could not be contacted immediately for statements.
As it is William L. Roberts, II et al., Stefan Kendal Gordy et al, at the American court of Southern District, Florida, No.

Dr. Carson approaches Trump in the latest presidential survey of the Republican Party
According to the latest presidential survey for 2016, the politician no. Ben Carson approaches the bombing leader Donald Trump in the pre-republical elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush was low in seven-point surveys.
After the support of 27% of Trump in the latest survey of CBS/New York Times, Carson, pensioned neurochirurg, arrives at the second place with 23%, followed by Bush, by the TV view of Mike Huckabee, by the Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, each with about 6%.
The love of the Republican voters in the preliminary elections has grown from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, Ohio John Kasich, and the former executive director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two, however, at the numbers of one number.
Jeb Bush, who was Florida's former, and who was far away the Bush family standards, decreased with seven percent points in one month, while the Wisconsin Scott Walker's officer decreased with eight points.
In the last survey, Walker's output is 2%.
Carson has drawn a greater exhibition than Trump in the range of university resolutions (29% towards 21%), while Trump is before Carson in the preferences of voters without university diploma (30% towards 19%).
Trump is designed more men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of the investigators said that they were determined what candidate to support in the preliminary elections of their country.
Those who said I know with who the vote would support Trump twice more than Carson.
It is still too early to say for 63% of the Republicans for preliminary elections.
The reviews of the CBS/NYT from 9 to 13 September will be made public before a public presidential debate.
Carson's ascension in this survey reflects the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders before the leader for the nomination of democrats at the presidency, the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The last follow-up of the CBS presidential nominations shows that Sanders went up with 10 points and 22 points in Iowa, either in New Hampshire, in the range of democratic voters for preliminarity.
A rename specialist in ethics shows that sexual robots should be prohibited
A rename specialist in ethics in the robotic industry has launched a campaign in which it requires the prohibition of sexual robots development.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, a robotic expert at the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic disumanization of women and children.
"Sexual robots seem to represent a more important subject in the robotic industry, and the models of which they are inspired - how they will show, what roles will be very destructive," she said to BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sexual robots is not one against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not near.
It's inspired from class, race and gene.
Political power inspires the deceasing of it," she was for Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about this.
These robots will contribute to the growth of sexual exploitation.
Although sexual robots now are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that that is the first step to something more left.
It's a new and emergency, but we need to stop it from the face.
In fact, the industry seems to take ahead.
A few years ago, True Companion produced a bullying company who launched Roxxxy, "the first sexual robot in the world".
However, anxiety regarding the potential risks of artificial intellectual is not unusual, even in the large representatives of the industry.
Even in this early morning, the Executive Director of the Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk that in five years, something really dangerous happens.
An interview granted by BBC in December of the past year, the physician and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that “the conclusion of a complete artificial intelligence might mean the end of human race”.
Great Britain occurs the first renewed in Syria - RT UK
In the next days, the United Kingdom will receive the first reactions that have fled from the way of the Syrian war, announced the Internal Minister Theresa May.
These will receive assistance in the extensive reinstallation programme.
Reactions in the search for asyl come from the camps found at the borders with the battle devastated by war.
These are the first of the 20 000 resources that the United Kingdom plans to receive in 2020.
A speech in the Common Room, the Minister of Internal Affairs stated that it was "fighting quickly" to ensure more accessories.
In the process of receipt of vulnerable reactions in the United Kingdom, it is important to already be put to the assistance point and the extent they need and deserve.
I know the honourable members and the general public want to find more details about the number and the date when they are estimated.
May mentioned that it had to do more plans to ensure that reactions have appropriate provisions when they arrive.
I need to highlight that the level of extension needs a careful and medical planning to ensure that everything works as necessary.
I and the Minister for Syrian Reforms, Richard Harrington, will continue to keep the current room in this regard.
But I'm glad to say to the Camera that we're waiting for the first renewal in the next days and we work quickly for the planning of more visits in the weeks that will follow.
Prime Minister David Cameron took his wrath to the parliamentary and military people when he developed the plan for re-revisions, many thinking that the number was too small.
In September, Cameron stated in the Communities Room that the United Kingdom “will rise to the height of its morality” and will receive 20,000 rehabitants from the Middle East camps to the following general elections.
He added that reactions will not receive automatic asyl completely, but a humanitarian status that allows them to apply for asyl after five years.
However, the critics noted that the numbers were only 12 repeated daily, and the former liberal Democratic parliament Pa° Ashdown stated that the measures were "der's".
Furthermore, Ashdown discovered that children included in this scheme should be deported when they are 18 years if they don't get asyl.
In addition, considerable public personalities have also condemned measures in their range.
A common letter, large names such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said that the answer to the crisis is "too small, too late".
"This is an age that should be shared with our European age, not simply divided on the armies of countries approached by conflicts that enlarge people from their homes," they wrote.
Rubla is replaced by the global uncertainty fund - RT Business
The Russian Ruble strengthened on Wednesday, transactioned by 65.66 to the US dollar and with €.98 to the Moscow Bursa at 10:00 GMT.
The Russian currency generally won seven percent of its rate lower than 71 rounds for a dollar on 24 August.
Analysers say that the return of the roof has occurred due to the reaction of investors to the current global market disorders products of China weight, the possible increase in the rate of US Federal Reserve profit and the excessive reaction to the eftin oil.
Brent Counts grew up Wednesday with 61 cents, reaching 48.36 USD per baril.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) translated 72 cents more, at 45.31 USD per baril.
LIFE PURPOSITIONS: The most likely rate of profits will grow in the United States at the end of 2015 - US Fed
"It is possible that the volatility of saying its word, feeded by uncertainty about China and the time of increase in the rate of the federal debt, which will continue to give the tonne for oil and roof prices," said for Bloomberg Piotr Matys from Rabobank, experts in monetary policy strategy on the coming markets established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the strengthening of Russian currency.
The main Russian oil company Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are linked to the US dollar, began to buy roofs.
The global markets with the mouth soul will decide on Thursday of the Federal Reserve, whether it will grow or not.
The markets consider that it will not be done what could represent the first increase in the nine years of the US profit rate and have been translated to the larger debt Wednesday.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together in the drone traffic system
NASA already works with the US and with companies such as Google, Amazon and Verizon phone company at the depth of a database that allows drone pilots to reserve airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has been established at EU level yet.
Cooperation comes as a result of a very expansional disturbance in relation to the possibility of a small colision between the drones and the commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes the potential negative effect in life colours.
“Issue thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies by delivering products or catching data in urban areas with large density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco,” mentions the research.
Make a common set of protocols and air rules, the haos could be installed.
According to this O'Cat's baronease from the Lorz Chamber, the concern was enhanced on the foundation of reports on events on the limit of the production of an accident and the operation of drones of the ball stadiums, nearly the nuclear centres and the Eiffel Turn.
"In the last two years, over 400 calls made to the metropolitan police have been linked to drones incidents," said O'Cat.
What is the solution: building a system that follows all drones, especially those that fly to a height less than 150 metres, whether they are carried by commercial pilots or amateurs.
"When more small drones perform commercial flights at juice height, other than the pilot's visibility level, or even completely autonomous flights, a certain air traffic management infrastructure is required to separate the flights, in order to ensure complex operations, such as the delivery of colt in the city," she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as the design of the airspace, methods of preventing unfair and wind, congestion management, travel planning and redirection by similar methods of rules for road traffic, such as signalisation and benches.
They were trying to have a functional prototype p' in 2019.
Drone industry will explode in the European Union in the following years.
"We already see small and innovative SME companies in the United Kingdom who use this with significant effects in the energy, agriculture and media industry," says Lord Tariq.
In 2014, the Civil Aviation Authority granted only 670 authorisations for commercial drone operations in the United Kingdom.
The European Commission considers that drones industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU in 2050.
Dislike button: why he wants Facebook to know what hurts you
"A Look Back" works similarly, gathering the most important moments ( on Facebook).
But what will this mean for many users within Facebook borders, which are now more than the population of any country?
First, of course, a empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
Facebook's big value - approximately 240 billion USD after last statistics - is due to the unimagined quantity of data about consumers that it holds.
Each interaction, posting, appreciation and friendship you do are collected and building a remarkable complex image found in a permanent update, about your preferences.
This is primarily valuable for publicity agencies, who can use all these information to choose carefully what to see Facebook announcements, selecting those who are most interested in their products.
A empathy button holds another set of data and, with a view to, opens a door for another type of publicity agents to use the platform.
While a sports company looks for a national team of bal, charitable organizations and promotors want to address those who, for example, "empatize" with the reaction crisis.
Also, this will probably change what you see in the News.
Facebook uses incredible intelligent and sophisticated algorithms to restrict that huge universe of content you could see, in the smaller flow you actually see.
This algorithm is essentially depending on what you have considered interesting in the past and, especially, on what he has made you.
There's no doubt on Facebook fear that many interesting posts, but unfortunately, do not enter the algorithm, because people don't feel that they should appreciate them.
However, if Facebook understands more about what you feel unfortunate or makes you feel unfortunate, you might decide to remove this kind of posts from Newtati.
Facebook has seen experiences in the past to understand how what you see in News affects your emotional status and, especially, how this is transmitted from one to another.
Environmental repeateds call this "emotional contamination" and even though it sounds left, it is probably just a simple Facebook test (and published with their agreement) to understand better how their platform works and if it can adjust the algorithms to distribute more elements.
What's going to be with the empathy button is on Facebook width.
The real challenge is the way to decide to add one button to its services to a single company can produce so many speculations.
The reason why this happens may be that the decisions taken by Facebook - or that it includes the visible buttons we see or the invisible algorithms that work hidden - have deep consequences today.
Now we enjoy a significant part of life in the digital world, which we do to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another that leads to a constant fight for survival in Darwin's yellow world and social networks.
The decisions he takes, including with regard to new buttons, will be the most possible to overflow in this course.
I think a lot of people can empathy this, and soon they'll have a button for this.
Biometric breasts can anticipate crises to autism
During the ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team found that the signs of the body can anticipate these events, sometimes violent, before it occurs, giving the assistants the opportunity to take measures.
Children with autism with which we work can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say that it hurts the head or that "he's too shout" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body sends us, and we need to do this in a black and intrusive way.
For example, simple visualization of colors in an application can show the level of agitatation. The red can be used to warn about a change of behaviour, and blue for lack of interest, giving the assistant understanding that it is flexible and needs stimulation.
Data from brass can be collected in time and saved on a safe server, helping careers to understand the picture of the way it responds to different activities and that would be the most possible intervention.
I have to say very clearly that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magical, they need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with producers to continue developing this, to be specific for autism.
The research was conducted by Jane Carolan, the client service manager from Virral Authistic Society, which will present within the Autech Conference on autism and autism from Manchester on 1 October.
When you work with the suffering of serious autism, as we work, you see different spectacular things that can lead to their life's quality of assistance. Now, applications for iPad give, at your own, a voice of people who have never spoken.
Robots help your children to learn to play your hide.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistance technologies can actually change life and we feel that it is part of our mission, as a loving autism organization, to ensure that all of us have this information and are also part of the debate in which we want to support the future with autism.
Fran's going to attack Isis in Syria "in the next weeks"
In the following weeks, the French war aircraft will launch air attacks on the targets of Isis in Syria, announced Wednesday, only a few days after President François Holland declared that the intervention was "necessary".
The first air attacks of the juadist group, the Islamic State in Syria, "in the next weeks", stated the minister of Jean-Yves Le Drian Wednesday.
The French air forces deal with recognition missions in Syria of 8 September, and the attacks will follow “in the next weeks as soon as we have clearly identified targets,” Le Drian said for the radio post France Inter.
Le Drian stated on Tuesday in Parliament that the State of Islamic has made "the very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the North Alep region.
"In the sea's river there is an extremely powerful offence, and if it is possible, it could destroy the Syrian Army, or the Syrian national coalition, or the rest of it," he said.
Fran_ is part of a United States coalition, which a year bombards Isis positions in Iraq, but the Holland has changed the strategy last week to expand the actions in Syria, in the political pressure, in the Southern threat to Fran_
United States of America, Canada, Turkey and Golf States have already been involved in attacks of Isis military in Syria.
The locking characteristic of the iOS 9 advice will make the phone more faster
The newest version of iOS 9 is launched Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and anxious for online editors - is the ability to easily block announcements during the web navigation.
The new function will allow users to download thirds that block cookies, reclaims, pop-up windows and other types of publicity during the use of the version for the remote Safari browser from Apple.
At tests, it was demonstrated that after the claims were blocked, news sites such as New York Times were loaded twice faster, according to Reʹs.
The locking of claims also helps users to maintain the use of data and the autonomy of the battery.
Users will benefit from more claim blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular tool for the locking of accusations for the desktop, started its own iOS web browser that limits the accusations; the Creator intends to start in the future a weather for Safari.
Persons who use claim blocking programs occur a few constraints.
Apples are still shown in applications (from this you win Apple money on iOS).
More more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent their visitors from using such claim blocking features.
However, the grade of use of them on desktop computers increased by almost 48% in the year.
The challenges for online media, which are largely offered free to consumers and supported financially for many years through publicity.
A report says that the blocking of claims could cost online editors nearly 22 billion income generated from reclame only this year.
To activate the blocking of claims in iOS 9, users need to download a application for blocking the claims, then to set up Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to activate a blocking content.
Obama is talking about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the kings of Spain
President Barack Obama occurred on Tuesday on King Felipe VI of Spain at the White House, where both discussed various subjects, but which probably have reduced the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and Kings have addressed the subject of fight against the Islamic State and the more accented crisis of immigrants in Europe - which already confronts hundreds of thousands of people who have seen their origin to move west.
"Spania has been very trying to face this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are many times involved in very dangerous travellers and the problem of trafficking," Obama said.
Of course, the problem was complicated in the last months.
Obama also focused on the importance of cooperation, especially in the context in which Spanish territory Catalonia will vote in the elections that will take place in this month.
"In terms of external policies, we have firmly engaged in maintaining the relationships with a powerful and united Spain," Obama said.
The Supreme Commander told King Felipe that he would like to visit before his mandate was completed in 2017.
"We'll get you with the dismissed arms," Philip answered.
First lady, Michelle Obama, made the queen a tour of the White House and they had a discussion with the tea.
That was the first visit of the king's cousin in the United States from the surroundings on the throne.
After they left Washington, they had to visit South Florida.

The arctic roys are great enough to get a carrier
Many studies have highlighted the species that have become more vulnerable because of the climate, but the global warming has proved good for others.
One of these advantaged species is the arctic country.
According to researchers from the Dartmouth College, the warmest temperatures in the Arctic region allowed countries to appear before and grow greater, leading to the deceasure of their population.
A new study, researchers from the Centre John Sloan Dickey for Internacional Intelligence from Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their observations from the territory to illustrate the effects of the temperature change in the land.
Their analysis predicts an increase of 50% of the land's survival rate of adults in a 2-degrees increase in Celsius temperature.
The countries are small, but they represent important members of the arctic trophic band and the eco.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B - aims to help biologics anticipate better how a growing country population could affect the carrier with which they feed, the birds and insects that feed with them and the plants that they pollen.
To build their demonstration, scientists from Dartmouth combined their results from the land with the results of experiments that have investigated how temperature affects insect disorder and predicted the position to be sealed by sellers.
Although the growth of temperature makes the country greater vulnerable to the coleopters, it also offers them a timely start in the early morning and makes their larves to be faster and more vulnerable, which is, of course, an advantage.
More countries are a greater population, which can be deceived, but only as they can support the food sources of insects.
The ability of the countries to transform their collected survival rates into a collected reproduction rate depends on their ability to ensure their blood for food.
The antidepressives taken during the task do not affect the child
Three new studies show that the administration of antidepressives to pregnant women has no effect on neuronal or behaviour of their children.
The results indicated that selective inhibitors of serotonine recovery (SSRI) represent an increased risk of postpartum blooding, but researchers have concluded that depression is a higher risk for women and their children, therefore treated.
"These studies are a further set of evidence of the administration of antidepressives during the task," John Thorp, adjuded editor of the International Journal of Obstetrica and Ginecology, published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, the evidence now seems to show that the risks of depression is greater than the higher use of antidepressives.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the disturbance of children whose mother had treated with SSRI, analysing data of 51 404 children from the Norwegian Corporation of Mother and Child, looking for the effects of the use of SSRI for disabilities of the motor capacity at age of 3 years.
Researchers discovered that 381 SSRI mothers used during the task, and 159 of them were treated with medicals a long time.
Although the exposure to SSRI was associated in some measure with a late delay in the engine delay, researchers wrote in the study that the association “is not so significant to give a clinical importance to delay”.
A group of researchers at the University of Adelaide from the Adelaide has conducted an examination of data for 49,000 women from Danish National Cohorta to discover the effects of the administration of SSRI's behaviour of children at age 7.
It discovered that depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behaviour problems.
In 210 children whose mother was treated against depression with SSRI, there was no increased risk of behavior problems compared to 231 children who were more predicted to behavior problems such as hyperactivity, attention and socialization problems.
The same group of Australian researchers also discovered in a separate study that mothers are more predicted to blood after birth if they are treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 indicated that the risk of post-natal hemoragy increased by 5%, between 11 and 16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe hepatic or postnatal anaemia was doubled, reported researchers.
Researchers said that although the study linked SSRI administration with increased risk, there was a large number of variables - from the medicines taken during birth to the limited amount of information received by researchers on the specific medical effects of women - which could have been affected on the potential of blood.
"It is possible that women who have taken antidepressive antidepressives in a progressive stage of the task to be those with the most serious stage of the disease, and that is the reason for growing risk of postnatal blood, not antidepressives," says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at the University of Adelaide.
Only on the basis of this study, we recommend that women stop the treatment of depression during the task, but to be almost monitored to reduce the risk of potential blood.
Matthew is charged for crime in case of killing students from the University of Technology Virginia

The big Juy from Albemarle, Virginia, made Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. on Friday, 33 years old, from Charlottesville, for murdering Morgan Harrington, saying officials.
Matthew is also accused of raping with the intention of violation.
Each head of accusation receives the maximum chain of life.
Harrington, 20 years old, was divorced from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say that the news of the accusation was easier for them.
"We've been working decisions and unrelevant for this purpose for six years," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.

Jesse Matthew accused of qualified murder in case of death of a student at the University of Virginia
Harrington went to U-Va. on October 17, 2009, together with friends, to a Metallic concert.
The group was separated when Harrington went out of John Paul Jones Arena from Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't go back.
Last time it was seen trying to take a taxi around 20:30 in front of the area.
Harrington was clothed with a black trick with Pantera.
After her disappearance, Harrington's mobile phone was found in the arena parking.
Family and friends started an extensive search of Harrington, which was consistent of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a professor. The people from Metallica wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the trick that he carries was found a string of apartments in Charlottesville.
Apoi, in January 2010, her body was discovered in a isolated sand, in a southwest farm of Charlottesville.
During Harrington's disappearance, Matthew worked as a tax driver in Charlottesville, but it is not clear if that period overlooked the date when Harrington disappeared.
Police says that a significant progress in the delay of the case of Harrington was represented by Matthew's arrest in the case of Graham's disappearance last year.
The officers who knew the investigation said that these cases were linked by DNA evidence.
The investigators have not made public details on the new evidence that they decided to put Matthew under charge for Harrington's murder.
The lawyer, Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in the case of Graham, refused to give statements.
The announcement of the accusation is due to two days after the completion of a year since Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both were young students who disappeared when they went out to Charlottesville.
Graham, 18 years old, from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a middle of the center, near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later, after a search at national level.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be judged for qualified murder in the case of Graham.
In the first days after Graham's disappearance in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence of the medingments and views organized for the student divorced from U-Va.
Harrington says she was compassionate for her daughter's speculations and critics in the media that must be reduced to the silence of the new chapters of accusation against Matthew.
"In all this time, there have been discussions of the kind "Why do you bear a short fucking?" and "And are you looking for it with the lightning?" But this kind of questions and judged are not valid when it is clear that we have to do with a dealer on the wind's tracks," Harrington added.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was condemned for sexual attack against a youth in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 years old at the attack, told the jury that, on a night of September, when she returned home down from the store, a stranger came behind her.
She took her into a reverse area, kidnapped her and knipped her, and then attacked her sexually.
"I thought the end came to me, that I had to tire in silence," she witnessed.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew took her away, she said the woman again.
A prosecutor told the jury that Matthew could have been afraid of the ships of a car that comes into a nearby park.
He was sentenced years later, after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew's going to get a watch in October.
Matthew will come for the first time in the Harrington case in Charlottesville Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said the most likely will come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the pool where his daughter was seen last time.
"I've made a step more today," says Dan Harrington.

Don't support terrorism anymore!
The Syrian President Bashar of Assad granted a rare interview of Russian pressure, in which he speaks deeply repeated and accused O's support for terrorists and that he's "in vision" to immigrants.
"A planner for her and O supports terrorists from the beginning of the crisis, when he said that this is a re-panic," Assad said in an interview granted by Russia Today.
The leader of the ́c understood that his western homologies say about Syria's terrorism is like the Islamic State, "but because of Syrian state or Syrian regime or Syrian President".
As long as this propaganda follows, they will have more repeated.
So it is not about the fact that Europe has not accepted or not impressed it as re-eye, it is about not to treat the cause.
If you're worried about them, you don't support terrorists anymore.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the nuclear of the entire issues of the repeat," said the Syrian leader.
Assad continued the accusations to the Western States and regarding the treatment they showed to the girl of repeat.
It's like the O's now planning for re-eye and taking it in view with the Mitralary with the second eye, because those repeateds have actually stopped Syria because of terrorism, in principle because of terrorists and crimes, and in the second way because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and the destruction of infrastructure, you won't have the basic resources of life, so that many people are going for terrorism and because they will punish their existence somewhere in this world," says Bashar al Assad.
"If I ask any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing that he would say would be "We want security and security for each family and every family," he highlighted the Syrian president, as political forces, or as it is within or outside, "the Syrian people should join around what they want."
The President of Syria thinks that the dialogue in the country should continue "to reach a consensus" which cannot be implemented "as if we infrastructure terrorism in Syria".
"We want to benefit from this opportunity to ask all the strong ones to join terrorism because it is a way to reach the political goals that we, as the Syrians, want through dialogue and political action," Bashar of Assad further said.
It also talked about one of his great alliance, Russian president Vladimir Putin, insisting that in the context of the Ukrainian crisis, it was transformed from O's friend to his enemy.
Bashar of Assad compares Syria's comparison to the Russian, accusing once again the O'O for the reality of both cases.
Note what happened in the west press after the Ucraine shot.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed into a friend of O's enemy and was characterized as a tar.
It is portraited as a dictator who removes the Russian Opposition and has reached power through non-democracy means, despite the choice of the democratic elections, and the O'self renewed that the elections were democratic.
Now, I'm not democracy anymore.
"This is the Western propaganda," the leader pointed.
Not at the last time, this included Russia on the list of friends - and regional partners - with which Syria is ready to cooperate against terrorism, Iran and Iraq, "when they agree with the same type of terror."
Instead, Bashar al Assad criticized Turkey, another great neighborhood, as well as President Recept Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said "I can't even do a move without coordinating the United States and other western forces".
Moreover, the presidents of Syria accused "the international coalition", led by the United States, who struck against terrorism: "When this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State began to expand."
In other words, the coalition has succeeded and has no effect on the territory.
At the same time, strong, such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western Tarses that provide a covering for terrorism, such as France, the United States or other, cannot fight against terrorism.
You can't be with terrorism at the same time.
"But if these strong ones decide to change their politics and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in the buzzard, you will enter - then we have no purpose to cooperate with all these strong ones, because it is a real coalition and not, which will fight against the terrorism," said the leader of the lac.

Card of Tars with the biggest yeftin and how Romania stands
Oil cotation has caused big losses in the last year of workers in the extraction of title, energy company shareholders and tariffs that are very dependent on this resource.
But there is also a positive effect: the benzine has been enormous.
A compiled map of Bloomberg seems that, in October 2014 - July 2015, nearly all 76 bills were calculated, the fuel price has expired.
The most important price reduction is observed in Venezuela.
In this way, the engine was 97%, so you can feed 24 US with less than a dollar.
The opposite pool is Saudi Arabia, where the price is fixed by the state.
The cost of the engine varies from the top to the top, depending on the raffination conditions, changes in taxation and fluctuations of the currency.
For a more precise comparison, Bloomberg transformed the average price from each state into US dollars.
Situation in Romania
The Bloomberg data appeared to be $5,49 in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a benzine gallon (approximately 3.8 litres) was $5.49.
So we're classified at the 27th place in the case of taxes with the best fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position in the top.
The latest quarter of 2014, the benzine was also efficient to Romans.
Then the average price of a galon was $6.14, which means a price reduction by 10.6%.
All of us, the ships around are better.
In Bulgaria, a benzine gallon is about $4,92, and in Hungary $5,20.
The people put the trip of immigrants in midnight: What Merkel promised
The German canceller Angela Merkel promised on Tuesday night that the Federal will grant additional exhibition to the 16 federal lands in receiving and distribution of thousands of people who enter the south of Europe.
After an approximately four hours meeting with the presidents of the 16 federal states, Merkel said that "the most important thing now is to create a ordered and transparent process to make the girl of the large number of repeateds," noted the DPA agent.
She added that the Federal will create 40,000 places for initial society, as well as distribution centres.
"I'm needed such pivot points," she highlighted.
Intressantly, I have to provide a massive impulse to make the girl of the crisis, he advised Merkel.
The country premiums have requested more assistance than the 6 billion euros agreed on the federal coalition after more than a week.
Prime Minister of Turing Bodo Ramelow from the Stanga Party requested a number of "mindest double, and for commitments, to be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
At the random or, the Prime Minister of the Renania-Palatinat country, Malu Dreyer, insisted that its entities were rapidly integrated in the German society.
"We need a national agreement between all players, not only the federal, states and municipalities, but also the institutions, syndicates and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also requested that birocracy in the manipulation of his repairs and migrants be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed the processing in 48 hours and Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
Premier Minister of the Ba - Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
By now, Ba'a was the biggest poor gate, with the most often came after the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a powerful actor on the federal scene as the leader of the Cristin-Sociale Union (CSU), a key component of the Federal Coalition Federal, has entered into public conflict with Merkel after the canceller announced a policy of the doors to begin moon, remembers DPA.
Mircea Lucescu scandal after the humble infrastructure with Real Madrid
Mirce Lucescu was a nervous car at the end of the race with Real Madrid, which Sahtior Donetk lost with 0-4.
The Roman teacher seemed totally determined by arbitration, saying Sahtior lost intrusion was defavorized.
Before I said one thing, I want to be respected.
Unfortunately, in major teams in Europe, we are always deprived of arbitration.
There's two complete ways.
News are given to us a green carton immediately, while the top teams are not.
Moreover, the first penalty wasn't in any case!
The Lunge hit Dario back without touching his hand.
A similar level of game was not supposed to be influenced by arbitration.
"Record that the arbitration has lost the game," said Mirce Lucescu at the press conference.
"Ma'am, but what amazing is so bad here?"
They were kitchens of the man's tranched.
A murder of a sadism out of the commune threatened the residents of Târgu Frumos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, at the first hours of the day, the pigs of Târgu Frumos could see territory scenes on the market.
The three tombs, the criminals have "combined" from the kitchens what seemed to be the body of a man.
It was tranched, but they missed the head, the internal organs and the genitals.
Finally, it was to prove that it was the body of an ex-official, who was translated by his wife, the professor of geographic.
"Isai's zirl" was talking to the gentle one who helped the criminal, without knowing, the way of the sacks with the end of the body.
This stories make your fucking hair.
The one who warned the police yesterday about the fact that a woman whose three sacks were scared, after you kissed out of the body fuser found on the market, was a taximeter in Târgu Frumos.
Like in the American movies, the man helped himself to transport sacks full of human kitchens, who were hard to smoke, but not to know, the criminal being a customer for a course.
The Taximetrist told, in the ambition of the "The Zirl de Iaşi", the shocking scenes through which he passed, helping without wanting a killer to hide proofs.
He was driving with his hands of the bags where the bodies of the man of the geographic teacher, which he traced.
She came to Târgo Beautiful to hide the evidence of crime as far from her home, from Roman.
Maybe he has mines.
I didn't have where you know.
Mother Mihai, like her friends practicing the taximeter in Târgu Famous, has been watched at night in the small town where she lives.
He saw American movies throughout his life, but he never thought he would ever be he who would stand on the basis of discovering a sad crime, and he'd see with his eyes bounds of body.
It tells us that on Monday night to Tuesday, it is usually like the arrival of cars that transit the locality regularly.
It is almost about the intersection of roads to Roman and Pajcani.
The Taximetr indicates that the killer observed her in the retrovisual mirror, the cottons with the body cooks exposed by the indicator that shows the proper locations.
She came the night with Massaro's course from 1.30.
The car left it at 10 meters of the paskans' crossing from the Pajcans, exactly at the boat where the kilometer is shown.
The sacks were packed with the indicator.
After the car went out, I gave the car 10 meters in the march, to it.
I discovered the portbag, and after I put a sack, I asked, "Lady, but what is it so bad here?"
I saw she was an old woman, and I told me to help her.
I thought he was taking meat to the market, often, maybe he had a meat, I didn't have anywhere to know.
I've been thinking that she might want to kiss someone with that hateful meat.
She tried to lift a sac alone, and I repeated to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the sack, where he was connected.
"He specificated me to take her to the big market gate, when I took her from the car," she began to tell Mihai.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He concluded that the woman didn't say absolutely nothing, and, therefore, he didn't have any interest in asking her something.
I didn't talk anything, because I was nervous that I was driving my hot in my car.
And when he dropped the bags down from the car, I noticed that he was smoking and worse.
She dropped the baggage bags down.
When I came back into the car, I put two meters back to return, and I realized I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
I left the wallet locked and moved the car out and here so that the mirror could disappear.
At the car I didn't see if someone was helped to run the bags, because I had the backs and I didn't see well in the watch.
"There were two plastic sacks and one rafies," the man completed.
Seeing the woman's strange behavior, she says she began to make her curiousness.
In my mind, I realized something wasn't in it.
After he gave his bags down, I went to hospital, to Primature, and when I returned, I forgot specially to see what the woman's doing with the baggage.
She traveled between the baggage after the guard, where the tombrons are inside the market.
Then we left again.
It was a little aggression because a microbus from Italy and a car came.
I saw how the woman went to these drivers to go up to them, go away, but probably the drivers didn't want to take it, because they had international courses, and they didn't take passengers from the opportunities.
The woman was very aggressive, walking around and here.
At a time, the woman entered Peco, and, curiously, I asked a employee outside what she did inside.
The employee answered that he went and spent his hands.
Then I asked him where the police quarter would be, because I saw her a while ago.
I looked for them and found them coming to the market.
I kissed the woman and I told them it was something suspect.
"Therefore we went on the other side, a course at Belcesti," Mihai completed.
He told us again that the woman became aggressive after she left the baggage at the tombrons.
At me, the suspicion went away from the fact that he discharged the bathroom, and I was wondering what he did with him.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what they were doing there, and they looked at me, saying that I was watching her that she had a suspicious bathroom.
Then, the woman went to the tombrons and bought them the bathroom.
"I returned to the place where he hid the sacs about 3 hours when I gave statements to the police and the prosecutors of the place," he completed his taximeter report.
Professors in Germany, who investigate the case, say that the teacher of 64 years, Ana Zaharia, was surprised by the rooms to take views of a benzine from Roman at 0.55 p.m., walking with the three sacks in the car.
She reached the Beautiful Târgo at 1.30 p.m.
According to the investigators, she would have killed her husband, who was married for four years, with a cup, and then put him in the house.
The man named Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was officer in the reservation.
Saturday evening, the woman put the bodies in two plastic bags, which he carried to the car, and hid them.
On the evening, he transported another one, then decided in which direction to go, and chose the car București - Iaşi.
Last night, the prosecutors did not know where the woman hid the husband's internal organs, nor the genitals.
But the head was found covered in a newspaper and puzzle, in a bar in the woman's apartment.
She was pensioned, as her husband.
In tonight, the prosecutors didn't find out from a woman that was why she killed her husband with so bad and sadistic blood.
Most likely, the teacher will be psychically expertised, and the body will be examined by legal doctors to determine officially the cause of death and other relevant details.
The premium took the national roads of the job race, after years ago, to be appealed to the national budget in the electoral campaign of 2004.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL), and to be applied, the Government needs a decision.
Some sources say that the transfer of the administration right from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a meaning because this is in the establishment to grant the General Bankist Plan (PUG).
The premium took a 11-km network of roads.
In any case, a legislative amendment adopted in July 2015 forces the municipality to take the national roads transiting the job.
No opinion can be released from the National Roads if the law is not respected, so it was necessary to approve this.
The national roads have passed in our administration from today.
"Beneencies, the decision will be too necessary in consequence of this decision of the Local Council," stated Mihai Chirica's interim leader.
The national roads tranched by the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The Nacional Street 28 battles Iașel on the arters: Siseau Pecurari, Moora de Foc (to mafor), Moara de Foc, Structuring Silvestre, bd. Nicolae Iorga, bd. Fridays, Path of Chişina, Shooters at the outcome of the work to Tomesti - Albi.
The other national road, DN 24, includes the Bucium sixth, bd. Socola (pÃ© to semafor), Bucium street (pÃ¦ to Baza 3), the Path of Chişina, bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, bd. C.A. Rosetti and the outcome to Cârlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
Continuing the description of files in the "dosar" of the political symptoms of the youth of Mircea Eliade, which, as condensated, would have been presented by the size of a quotidian article and must be spread in the series, I think, evocated friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the oldest accusations captains used by the Great Savant Roman.
A less immoral description would, hope, be useful in the real debate that the latter law, said "antilegionary", would be supposed to cut it into the Romanian intellectual environment.
Analysing the various versions that were talking about Eliade's regulation in Legiune through the "Axa" and Radu Gyr Cube, Florin Türcanu brings in discussion in the volume of Mircea Eliade.
The historical prisoner (Bâreuriști, 2003), another hypothesis, which is the most interested in understanding the recovery of the postal contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after playing the Czechish "balcony scene" in August that year.
Based on the documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure during the security investigation, in 1941, documents stored today in the SRI archive (FD, File 573, f.15) and on a follow-up note of 1938, Florin Turcanu states that "Eliade will not enter their group, but thus "legionary family" called Lumini, a group of intellectual "cubicles", especially writers, led by the Radu Gyr Poet."
As regards the globe of the light, there are no types of verified data, the exiles considering exists to this "legionary" family, what is needed to be discussed is, then the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
By leaving to a surprising part of the SRI to provide these secret dossiers to Mr. Turcanu, it is more evident that at that time, the purpose of secureness was the "Commandant" Radu Gyr, mentioning Eliade, in accordance with the notes of 21 March 1938, in the context in which Armmand Célinescu, the Minister of Interne, took me free to take all the measures necessary for King Carol to impose its Royal Dictature, suspending the lives of the parliamentary and eliminating the main political force of the legionaries who began to take up an unexpected popularity (The whole party for worm takes out the third in the elections of 1937).
The arrest of Eliade was carried out as follows of this note, quoted by Turkish: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, in the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the lead of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr."
As regards me, I see this note as a underlying biocratic coverage for the repression of 1938 and it is probably that such superficial notes were made up to the great majority of the legionaries or the assets in the public space that had to be arrested, but which had to be linked by an important legionary leader.
The olographic statement of Radu Gyr, recorded above, arrested in February 1941, after legionary rebellion, does only confirm it retrospectively on the first, the biocratic covering method in any police regime, authority.
It would be interesting if Turcanu would have offered more details about the content of the record 573 quoted.
Was the record of Eliade or Radu Gyr?
Because anyway it must be a folder built on the basis of the security documents, but then taken by Security to be used or against the other one.
There is an equip here, as well as in the use of the "member" term of the Movement, which only someone who knows the integration of the internal organization based on a religious basis knows that it is a pre-member stage, of evidence, in which the person concerned behaves as an active, in the trial period of three years before being "camarad" with acts in line.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as the clubs or the intellectual clues, the seats, the groups of discussions with countries, adolescents or students of gravity around a cube, were his "family", they were not the proposed cup, as a form of political and action organization.
This kind of notion is completely escape from the unvisied reader by making the "member" status of Eliade (which may be pleasable) to be understandable and used at letterram to design the political regulation in the cub.
Of course, calling for subtility interpretation of this genre can not hide the public activity of Garza's exhibition and neither clear compassion for the Captain who animated Eliade during the period 1935-1940, whether in the case of Nae Ionescu or not.
The public support of a cause you believe does not mean, however, as necessary, and the proposed political regulation as well as, of course, intellectually, that keeps a type of superiority towards the activists as such and does not enter into the policy than when they are directly offered high privileges.
As long as I could make a view of Eliade's kind of thinking in that period, when he was "the leader of the young generation," I'm hard to believe that he'd accepted hierarchy rigors in a legionary cube.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendent yet!
To not mention, but in the past, the fact that, in any "dossier" legionary, what it receives is the public activity antisemed and violen, both worthy of being stumatized, but inexistent in the case of Eliade, for our tests.
As regards the correspondent of Eliade-Gyr from 1968 to 1969, Mircea Handoca, an enthusiastic aspirant of Eliade, trys to sanctify Florin Türcanu's responsibilities (although based on some archive documents, even if it had been deserved more discreet and contextual) with an argument yet discussable.
Myrcea Handoca, in the volume of Noi glossed . Mircea Eliade (Bârest, 2006), finds that "no one of the correspondents between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr does not contain any allusion to this income".
He didn't even have the way in 1968, when Radu Gyr couldn't risk any allusion in a letter that, obviously, was intercepted by censure.
What I think he wanted to highlight Myrcea Handoca is the fact that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectful, admiration and affection without doubt of Eliade's ascendance.
There's not really the most crazy suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been Eliade's boss.
Intelligently, the poet obliged to write to the Patria Glass, devoted his place by signing to Eliade (which knew very precisely what mission had that publication that was occupied constantly with the denigration of the exile of the right), in signing, after "Your old friend", to what to stay and is visiblely and happy when this answers adequately after nearly three decades of divorce from when "the time's time's expelled them.
There is no doubt that, besides the "mission" with which he was pregnant (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he might be quiet at least to see his mother and friends) and that he, possibly, fills the sec and by short propositions, separated from paragraphs, to suggest their character of foreign body, Radu Gyr shows its interest only for herself.
Nothing about the isothern allusions, the suggested political complexity or any evocation of the years of youth in another register than the cultural.
It is difficult to believe that Radu Gyr would be higher than Eliade's legionary line, but at the consolidation of this version with less circumstances evidence than those offered by Florin Türcanu, we have in this corresponding memory cups that test the mutual price of individuals who have marked, but stonely, our culture, and who, besides the full trials of life, retain the tone of civilization and interble education.
Human and cultural documents important and, why not?, model for friendship and mutual respect besides the destination of the authors.
At the beginning of the 1970s, Eliade finally refused to re-evaluate the status obtaining the American citizen and, under the pretext offered by health problems and invasion disasters, announced the RSR authorities through the ambassador (with which it has a sporative compatibility used to get passport for his sister), that it cannot take the invitation to return to the wedding.
The following was predictable: it is repeated to index, it is mounted in Israel "Toladot business", the books sent to the family and friends (Fragments of a journal, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped with censuring, never seeing his mother again.
Among the friends in the nurse only with Noica has a sporadic coincidence, although, in a way surprisingly, such as a personal archive from Chicago, a lot of particular or Romanian institutions are more able to send messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr hasn't been allowed to write her after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Czech Republic tried the second operation of Eliade's convincement (with official invitations, Noica's demers, translators, etc.) Radu Gyr has already passed forever.
New intern, foreign players
Because of the penuria of autohtone volibalists, Penicilina Iaşi testeasiá in sport tours in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Outputs participate in preparation tours under the command of entrepreneur Dan Gavril
Retrograded in the first half of the year of the Division A1 of Women, Penicilina Iaşi kept its place in the first exhibition due to the retraction and then the deficiency of the School of Miroslava, promoted in the first exhibition after a bargage tour even in the common exit.
The news took a little bit of the leadership of the outside group, which remained without the main trainer (double leave of Rareș Puni, became second to Sciin ́ Bacau) and many missing players, some retraces such as Cristina Lungu and the liberal Diana ́neanu, or left, like Ana-Maria Berdilă (the campion of the Volla Blaj) and the sisters Maria and Juliana Fica.
In fact, for the restart of the planned campaign on 10 October, there was still a time to complete the lot.
First, a new trainer was found in Dan Gavril's day, coming from the LPS Steatra Neamtz master team and who worked at the past years in Penicilina, which was to sign a short contract with the grouping of the Vasiles State.
Apoi were brought two players from City, Miroslava, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconice, being tried and a few foreign players in Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, closer to transfer by being the grass player Katarina Jovanovic (af Amiens, Fran日) and Montenegro Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of Monday, Peniciline's lot led by Dan Gavril performed a cantonment at Gura Humor, after participating in a tour in Lugoj and along with Cupa Banat, where the outcomes made a victory (3-0 with the University of Cluj), but they also suffered two errors, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMUiova.
Vie week, in September 23 to 25, Penicilina will participate in another tour, in the iowa.
For the new campion, we're trying to get a valuable team.
We have a comprehensive and experienced trainer, but the player fund in Romania is quite decreased, and therefore we will call to foreign volleybalists, especially after the decision that teams can use an unlimited number of players outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of sports from the clubs in Romania.
"We hope to reach the end of the competitive year at 5-6 places, even if it's very hard," said the Vasile State, President Penicilina Iaşi.
Emotional appointment.
Games gathered after almost 70 years
George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, age 69, were born at the end of the World War II, in Germany, after their polandic mother was almost released from one job.
Because she was too sick to care for her, the women were sent to Poland to adoption, and the two brothers were so separated not only by the one who gave them life but also the other.
Ten years ago George and Lucian didn't know one about the other.
At age 17, George discovered the documents that showed that it was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the 1960s, he asked the Red to help him get his brother, but they didn't find any track to lead him to Lucian.
Abia in 2015, the grace of the program, "Restoring Family Links" of the Red, the gems met again, and the time was one more than emotional.
The BBC repositories surprised this episode.
Ten children in Iaşi brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sports
Two gold medals, a silver medal and one bronze were won by the children out of the German Open Championship of Stuttgart, a international sports dance competition organised by the German Federation of Dan Sportiv and the World Federation of Dan Sportiv.
From Iaşi, five pereches trained at the Dance Energy Club and danced about 9.000 sports from 20 countries.
These 10 outside children participated in five categories (June 1, June 2, June 2, youth and amateurs).
Those who returned home with medals were the pereches: Razvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Târzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia  Stefana Gologan (bronz medal).
And other three pearls succeeded to occupy primary places: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia John Josub Cujba and not at the last time the pereche of Andrei Emily and Raluca Elena Ionicz.
As a trainer, I wanted to reconstitute the results obtained in March of this year, this reconstitution is needed both for us as well as for sports as for you.
The fact that we have been able to hear Romania's name twice this year at German Open and return home with four medals, gives us a huge hope and trust that we can raise both the club and the sports at a higher level.
"All of these would be done only with some important elements: involvement, respect, confidence and very much work," Andrea Ramona Manolache, the entrepreneur of children from the Dance Energy Club.
Romania was represented in this year of 34 clubs in ́ra, obtaining a total of 9 medals, so qualifying our place 4 of the 20 participating countries.
As mentioned, from the nine medals, four came to Iaşi.
6 methods to escape stress in a minute
Too few of us let us escape a weekend to the mountain to escape from stress.
Some of us have time, others - finances, and the other both suddenly.
There's the solutions to everyone who wants to get a little stress.
They do not include high costs or special time assigned, according to lyla.ro.
Daily cares are inevitable, but depends on how we do their girls and what attitude we take from them.
Instead of moving inside and feeling like an implosion is happening in your mind, better I'm sure you're taking the following relaxation tactics that don't steal you more than a minute.
Respire
Respiration exercises are not only the solists or yoga practicers.
They work for every man in part, and the rehabilitation of respiration in a stressed moment helps to release endorphines in the body, process that leads to a relaxation status, reports Livestrong.
Be Child
We know that we've passed the childhood's wallet and we're not allowing us to stumble when we've got a boss.
But that doesn't mean we can't go into a corner of the office room or wherever we know we're alone (also behind the cladding) and we're not typing how we have our flames.
You can escape nerves and negative energy accumulated during a day with some healthy swimming.
Imagine a beautiful place
We know that the recommendation deserves a replica during a psychotherapy session, but it doesn't hurt psychology usually use it.
Imagination of a beautiful place, which inspires us calm and decay of zilnic frenacy, can lead to the deterioration of nerves.
It's, in fact, self-sciousness, a procedure that can even change life, as well as in the race.
Everything depends on what we suggested.
The best thing is to think about an idiotic place that enhances our soul.
Listen to Music
Put your castles in your ears and you're relaxing music.
Attention, it's not about preferred music, because if it's heavy metal, it might be heavy to be weak in relaxing.
Listen even to the relaxing melodies, which are lines and do not contain verses, to take the balance at the time you learned the plant.
Children on the portfolio
Sounds strange the advice to decover a nerve portfolio?
Well, it's not!
Because it is not the fruit in itself, because it doesn't contain miraculous substances or Xanax to total us (local, too total).
It's about aromatic!
The mirror of the portscotch, during the decoding, stimulates the brain to produce endorphines, the hormone of good age.
Mangay a Animal
Those who have animals nearly, whether it's the householder, or that it's the one who's locked on the workplace, take a few seconds to meet him.
According to the National Centre of Infections in the United States, the animal mangaiation can lose the blood pressure.
hour and rock with vineyard and chitarrhood
Two musicians involved in instruments somehow rivals, but cooperators in this accustic project, Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous parts of the Roman foll combining life with the cytarr.
The acoustic project belongs to Christian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe musicians and is named WHEN Violin Meets Guittar,written hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found us, and from that moment, we were very pleased to sing together, having an unlimited practical record."
We thought that it was the moment in which a kitary was met.
Cristis: "From the first meeting, we realized that it was very good to hear what we sing and that, in view of the human component, things work."
Each of us learned from the repository, and what is very important is that the sounds of the two instruments are possible.
Florentin: "I know there's a crowd between classic music people and the rest."
I think a lot of people can do classic music.
And the second time we stole a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rocks, and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the point between the genes, we want to offer a kind of music that could do to those who were only his classic and rock music, and those who were just rocked to love and classic music.
And we had the surprise to tell us at the end of a concert that they never imagined they would do that and they would like it.
Cristis: "When we find young people -- and we get out of what more -- who know who Pink Floyd was, we seem to be amazing."
Students in Iaşi have been more in traffic than at school on the first day after vacation
Hundreds of outsides were "captives" last morning in the hell trading in more areas.
The premium announced that from today the Mangeron bulevard (splay to the left) between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Red.
The Primation Boss did not comply with their promises to carry out works for the liquidation of traffic once the school year.
One of the assurances that the municipality gave them, at least twice in the last weeks, refined the turning of the Internacional Gaza area.
Although only a few provisional elements were required to be mounted, and the last time of work was the end of last week, the turnover was not performed yesterday.
The driver nerves were maximally expanded on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, taking into account that another promise of the Primation was deteriorated: the movement of the customs activities from Nicolae Iorga to the Tehnopolis "the latter p" at the end of August", in the context of which this transfer is still discussed since 2012.
Currently, Mihai Chirica's interim leader says the problem of the International Gara is more complicated.
The direction will be made at the right time, we need to take account of the tramways in the area, need a view of the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tramway to go in the girdle, but we'll solve it in a way," said Chirica.
One of the solutions, according to this, would be the stop of the tramvay with a semafor before turning.
Problems were also in the intersection of Podu Roş.
The coat of cars on the St. Lazarus street spread to the SRI seat.
"I've been waiting for a good minute to get out to Podu Red," said an outside.
By the Podu Roș had to tramway to the CUG in September, if the rehabilitation project "Decision and rehabilitation of the functional art of South" had been completed in the initial execution period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complete the initial.
"We have drawn European funds for our works, for example over-largement, on the initial variant, the Nicolina passenger was stuck," commented Chirica.
The latest time for re-introduction of tramways is October.
During yesterday, the outputs signed problems in traffic, especially in areas such as Pecurari, Centre (Târgu Cucu, India, Armenian Street) or the intersection in Base 3.
The government could return as a boss to CJ.
In the morning you'll know sure.
Judges of the Court shall decide tomorrow whether the President's suspended Council and shall maintain the legal control and prohibitions.
The Magisters of the Court of Justice have solved a new term yesterday in the "Album", in which the President of Judean Iaşi has also been charged.
At the end of the yesterday meeting, the judges have decided to complain during the morning on the measurement of the judicial control currently imposed against the Government.
It finally wants to live or revoke this measure, which holds it away from CJ's boss for more months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if this is noted and of the above instance, Christian Government will be able to rename its CJ Chairman's function.
The Government was sent in Judgment by the Ancient ruption (DNA) Directory, accused of the promotion of the manufacturer and intellectual after, in terms of curories, would have been tried to mask a audit control in which a series of irregularities were found on receipt in a public contrast signed between CJ and Laser Co.
The Government would have tried to hide the fact that the institution that led would not have received more instruments for the promotion of the Iaşi Judge, although Scripting these materials figured as receipt by CJ.
Others from him have been distinguished from the justice and three directors of the CJ, but also the administrator of Laser Co.
There are still 3.500 outputs to vote on September 25.
The premium is ready to distribute other questions, if the 12.000 will be epulated.
The outsides have only ten more days to express their opinion on the replanting of the tea on the Great Stephan Petonal.
According to the municipalities officials, approximately 8.500 of the 12.000 issues distributed to the centres of apartment and in other three additional points of the city (Copou park, a planned Alexandru the Good and Primaria).
A record number of outputs was presented Saturday before the Primation.
According to the representatives of the civil group "Ishus loves the teas", 530 outputs voted in 140 minutes, or nearly four votes expressed every minute.
Instead, during the day of moon, there came approximately 440 outsides.
The volunteers of the group say that many outputs advertise signing and people ineffective public consultation.
Therefore, they made a call to the Internet users yesterday to shoot a group information show and pluck it into the blocks.
The volunteers also recognized that at the additional point of the park Copou the last formulaes were completed by Sunday outputs.
We'll offer a formula from the quarter centres where it's not too completed.
"Eventual additions we will do when all 12.000 formulaes will be completed," said the municipality's words, Sebastian Buraga, yesterday.
"New tea checks" will be completed on September 25, and if the major vote of the outside is in favour of the replanting of the trees, the Primation will plant your money in this hole.
Outsides can express their opinion at the centres of apartment in Dazia, Beauty, Tatterrasşi, Nicolina and Pecurari, as well as in the additional points above.
The Primarian boss decided to throw the teas from Stephan the Great at the beginning of 2013, which took a change of 60,000 lee of the municipality.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civil group "Iash loves the teas", a online community covering about 13.500.
In the environment, a request started by the civil group for the replanting of the teas was signed on yesterday night from over 9.100 supporters.
STUDENT RECORD registered at USAMV Iaşi!
I'm 920 in the year I.
University has 920 students in this year in the year I.
Responsants of the University of Science Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" claimed that this year was the most admissible candidates in the history of the higher education institution from the end.
We are very thankful for the results of this year from admission.
We have the largest number of candidates admitted in the university history, nearly 920 students in the year I. I never reached a number like this.
"We had and candidates with greater media, we occupied our places from the budget to the license and master," said Professor John Ţenu, prosecutor with the diplomatic activity.
It also stated that the University has registered a significant number of students at tax, occupating 20% of these places, a significant number of more than in other years.
Although the results were also published in the Roman language study lines, the admission continues to the English study programme from the Veterinary Medical Faculty, which was borrowing 50 places, where the tax is EUR 5.000, and now the Ministry's response on the confirmation of the documents of students and studies needed.
At the tomb session, 120 dossiers were placed at the 14 bullets and 209 were released to the concurrence in the "tax" regime at license studies.
The most files were submitted to the Agricultural Faculty, in number 75, in Horticulture were 23, and in Zootehnia, 22.
At the master's 18-shop session, at the 150 tax places proposed by the USAMV, seven of them in agriculture, five in Horticulture and six in Zootehnie.
The drivers fear that they enter the car wheels in the wheels of the Tudor Vladimirescu pool
The pool over the Bahlu of the Tudor Vladimirescu bullevard remained just as cool as when "The Horn of Iaşi" wrote about the problems he presented 10 days ago.
Our daily repositories then signed that on the axis that delimits the two senses of pass the asfalt was left, having adequate groups, some even 20 metres, which seems the beton areas representing the primary powder infrastructure.
The asfalt also began to be stuck on the other side of the ax, indicating that the advances would be accented.
At that moment, Mihai Chirica's interim leader states that the powder has no problems, being recently made a technical expertise, in order to initiate a rehabilitation project of powder and tramways, in value of EUR 5 million.
Prime Chirurgian states that the area affected by fissures and groups will be signed, so that asfalt reactions should be performed quickly.
The only measures taken, however, now have been mounting a pops and a signature bench, without even making a simple floor.
In this period, we focused more on the discovery of schools and works necessary for this purpose.
"It's a pointal expertise for the pool we're waiting for about a week with the details necessary for the intervention, I appreciate that we could go to the remediation for at least two weeks," said the interim primary.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my big son, Stefan, started school.
It's prepared, how he's trying to improve it.
I don't know if I'm going to do or let me get meat of melancolia; inclinate, passive, to the second variant.
First, because I feel that they've been only three weeks, not three years since I took him for the first time, with emotions, to the degree.
Although it easiers, no normal parent seems to grow up children.
Secondly, because I remember perfectly the same day of my childhood; then a village that, in the bed, has not ended even today.
I wasn't exactly what it usually calls a conscious student.
In contrast, I would say.
But my school has always been my.
So much, I've chosen to continue to frequency her, even if I was a teacher.
When I decided that is what I wanted to do all my life, I knew it wasn't a easy meal.
And no one with any table.
That's because, like each of us, I've given the whole soil of teachers: better or worse, more compassionate or insuffisable, more fair or imbecil right.
Unfortunately, there are people with other calls in this brass.
I think they're toxic, because they're leaving enthusiasm and even the mind of a t'arr ready to form.
I had the pleasure to give, how much I was student or student, over a few, little, decades of appreciation.
These meetings may be decided if they are at the appropriate time.
Who believes that the role of the cathedral is the banal of transmission of information is bitter.
This can be done to anyone; informally, it can be informed the student very well about one, that we only live in the time of transparency.
But a good teacher models the mind of the students.
He's sharing them, he's planning their thinking.
Stay at the cathedre isn't a privilege, as I think so much, but a big ambition.
Youths are very moftross, needed, unforgiving, and always willing to look for the hibbles of those in their faces.
That's how it's the age, the temperament.
In teenager, we all thought we knew everything, we had a conviction about everything.
When we get mature, we get to understand that we have only doubts.
That's why a teacher's role is to take the teenager out of the category and make him think.
I mean, he's determined to doubt, ask questions.
To discover the answers, whether they and the provisions.
To be involved in everything he does.
To direct it discreetly to the profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially that the student most times thinks that the teacher is his enemy.
One who's just trying to catch the wrong leg to sanctify him.
Or, that justifys him, the unintelligent pure, rebellious, due to life full of age's calls, looking at the one in the cathedre with suspect.
It just doesn't have how to accept the natural attempt to order it.
Adults are not allowed to pump at the point, they do not accept to impose restrictions.
Anyway, if I'm impressing that, they'll be recompensed.
And, unfortunately, when there is a strict cathedral, which is imprisoned by endurance and not communicating, the students recompense the given object.
There are thousands of such adolescents who rat meetings with large writers, in a model, because of the lack of tact of the teacher of Rome.
There are thousands of such students who have the impression that the history is a data collection, that matematics are all that can be more obsessive to their uncovered mind.
I always encourage my students: if you give a teacher that you don't kiss, who doesn't know to communicate as a man to you, don't let him share you from what he should be right to.
How was it that I became myself?
I had a very good teacher in the VI-VIII class.
He discovered my mind to some texts that have spoken to the pubert since then on his understanding.
I've met a college teacher who opened my library door.
I looked at him as a man in the other world: he had the walls of the house covered with browns of books.
I lost myself in his library, and I dreamed to have one of the same.
Now maybe I got it, but if I didn't get it out of my way, maybe I decided to make myself abalist.
Or the engineer or a lawyer or who else knows what.
I don't think such meetings are funny.
I don't believe in danger.
It is essential to give over the man who takes you from me and turns you patient to your own call.
And this is, most times, the teacher.
Now, my experience helps me talk about what it means to preach.
Only that it can't be delivered.
There's no teacher, so there's a mathematical teacher.
How can you fix the ineffective concepts?
You can, at least, without prejudice to send pitrified truths.
The cathedral can guide at least the reading, that's something else.
But especially, there may be no miraculous meetings between a reader and low books.
I'm meetings that can change the lives of the one.
There's meetings that can discover the mind, which can lift up, in the case of someone, the soldiers on the eye.
Therefore, the teacher must first be able to make students understand that there is no divorce between life and life.
In contrast!
A big thing, Al. Paleologist, one thing only appears paradoxal: "How much, so life, not inverse!" and he was right.
That's why a good afternoon prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in any way.
Fortunately, we always have a lot of things to learn.
And we, teachers, or especially we, teachers.
The most often, a great truth is only repeated from inheritance: not only the disciples have to learn from their teachers but also the inverse.
In the ideal way, the teacher should be a teacher, and the teacher a student.
Which, like any valuous, looks like the teacher when he finds his own way.
It's just right.
But the teacher was the one who learned the scene.
I don't think there's a greater happiness for a pure blood teacher than to endure so much divorce.

At the Detention Centre of Detention, the student is 15 years old and is in class I
The Ministry of Justice, Robert Cazancuc, said, at the end of the year of school at the Detention Centre, that the most student is 15 years old and is in class I, and the greatest is 25 years old and is in the XI class, indicating that they could have another life if they went to school.
We have chosen to participate in the school year's discovery in a center belonging to the National Penitentiations' nationality to try to draw attention, and thus, some less realities.
The best student, 15 years old, is written in class I, and the greatest is 25 years old and is written in the XI class.
"There are complicated subjects that the society is concerned about to deal with at this point, we all are concerned about our own concerns and problems, but we do not need to pass through the lesson that you are over 100 young people from the Detective Centre offers," said Minister Robert Cazancuc, Monday, at the school anniversary festival.
The Minister of Justice has drawn attention to the fact that the League of Education, motivated in many cases of lipse of material opportunities, may lead to tragedy, claiming that young people in this centre would have had another chance in life if they could follow any child's school course, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to learn what the law means and what consequences may have to be unrespected.
"The role of the penitentiary system is not the continuous isolation of people who have violated the law, put it behind high walls, but it is trying to restore and prepare them, for when they return to the community to have more chances of reintegration," added Cazancuc.
The Minister claimed that it was necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, routes, but it must be invested and in penitentiary systems because, in many cases, the detentions are at the limit of humanity and because it will be difficult to speak about the reintegration of convicted persons in the light of money and staff.
We cooperate very well with the Ministry of Education and thanks to this partnership, each year, in the penitentiary system, are more than 2000 students of school education courses.
Obviously, we won't change the night that hasn't been done for 25 years, but there's important steps we're doing.
"In all these deadlines we need to support the society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we do our obligation, that through your work these young people have a chance and does not represent a danger for society," Cazancuc said further.
The Ministry of Justice hated the success of both students and teachers, noting that the success comes only by the efforts associated with all.
"And because it is today the Holy Holy Holy Holy Festival, I would launch all students and teachers the invitation to visit the muscles in Sovietia, Marristis and not only to understand what the fight for ideals means," said Robert Cazancuc.
A Russian vote with the ears
Doctoral schools captured with two plagues to be defined!
Petition of Prestigious Universities in Iaşi and ́ra
Furthermore, 200 researchers, universities, personalities and students signed a request launched by the Academic Society in Romania in which they requested the Ministry of Education and Research Science Assessment, Sanction and even determine the doctoral schools in Romania "which allows and promotes academic taxation".
Among the signatures of the request launched on 10 September, there are also diplomatic frameworks and professors in Iaşi.
Among the signatory universities of the environmental petition is, for example, and Professor Liviu Antones.
At national level, the petition has names from the ministers of Education, such as Mircea Miclea, people of culture who are also universities, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Legal of Education provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this fact has not been done at present, determining such specific sanctions for doctoral schools that flagrantly violate the ethical standards of scientific research and does not produce relevant and re-effective performance at international level," it is stated in the initial petition.
In this request it is particularly requested to comply with the National Education Law, to evaluate doctoral schools, to suspend the right to work for any doctoral school in which more than two plagues have been found, in order to evaluate and remediate.
The latest requirement is to suspend the right to function for any doctoral school where there is no minimum number of doctorate leaders provided by law to meet the criteria set out by the National Research Council in 2011 for the eligibility for grants of IDEI projects.
Do you respect at least a general without doctor, or a politician, or an information agent in the Middle East?
"Why does not there be any other else in Europe who will give secret services organized, and major militaries who give it to self-emergency institutions, where the quality is verified by the environment of ́empics?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, President of the Romanian Society, the initiative of the petition, from Jaşi.
This can be completed by all the desires on the Internet page of the Society, and the final signatures will be submitted by organisation to the Ministry of Education and Science Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but ten thousand who want to be involved.
The "Petru Iaşi", founded by young non-political managers in the IT, was launched in the Copou Park.
The President of the Initiative Group "For Yaşi" has granted an interview of "The Zear de Iaşi"
Yash will have a dedicated party to the town's development.
A group of non-affiliated political operators and managers currently launched at the end of the last week the Party for the same organization that will propose candidates to local elections of 2016.
Currently, the party's nuclear is formated from IT specialists, but training initiators say that in the organization all people who want to be involved in the modernization of the city.
The launch took place on Saturday, in Copou Park, and at the event they participated more than 200 sympathys, almost all young.
The special invitation of the action was Nicuşor Dan, President of the Association Save Bucuresti.
He was the surprise of the local elections in 2012, when, from the position of independence, he was able to gather 10% of the votes for capital primary function.
"The people I've seen at "Pentru Iaşi" I think they're very good to access the public administration of Yaş."
I believe in this initiative, I think it has the chance, I think it can have more chances in a smaller community than that in Bucuresti.
"I'll be along with "For Iaşi", Niuşor Dan said.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iaşi to work in a foreign IT company?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are more emotional and emotional.
I was gone in a lot of short travelers, I lived a year in Cluj.
I came back every time, because I felt that it was my house here.
ZDI: Why have you decided to make a political party now?
Andrei Postolache:Now we have come to a certain maturity, we are a group of people we have started to know for a while.
We met in professional contexts, we started discussing how we could involve ourselves.
At the beginning, we involved more timid, in smaller things, with projects in NGOs, various building or charitable actions, and, somehow, things have developed natural and organic, and now it's going to be the time when we've reached the decision that we have to be involved more than that.
ZDI: call three concrete projects for the activity of local public administration!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimum information on the primary activity so that the departments, institutions and regions will cooperate as best.
But more importantly, it can publish transparency data on detailed activities: bugs, reports, projects, etc. We talk about informal organization.
Second, it would be transparency because this leads to.
If you have a project in a certain apartment, public consultation of the people affected is important.
If we talk about it, we don't have to forget the transport in common, we've got the bigest buses in the bus.
You have to buy new transport means.
ZDI: Today, the picture of a city is very important.
How would you promote the Iash?
Andrei Postolache: You're going to the plane and looking for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industrial events in which you can "come" the city.
You have to want to do that and know to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we brought customers to Iaşi.
What's the brand of the Iash?
Andrei Postolache: My appearance is that we must be a town of the town, somehow.
We already have the IT industry, and we have to expand it, go to medical, enter the robotic area, in the 3D printing, continue in this spirit and join such elements.
I think the brand should be in science area, I mean here the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Yash has already a mark that does not have to change, namely cultural cities.
I see the two elements in the balance: culture and.
ZDI: How will you compensate the experience lips in the public administration, as well as the traditional partial lips with which you still win elections in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: The operation is a form of management, which means organisation, planning, communication, work with people and project dilution.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional, we don't care about it.
We want people to be involved, we'll talk to everyone, we're not just Facebook, we're not online party.
We don't want to have "volontaries" brought with the bus.
That means we're based on people who really want to be involved and helped, and we think they're a lot of people like this.
ZDI: should the primary of the Yaș be more concerned about promoting the city's image at national and international level, or is it necessary that anxiety air continues to be built-in?
Andrei Postolache: One without another doesn't work.
First, you have to solve today's problems, the urgency.
Or, if you don't do your town , if you don't get money into the city, at a moment without money, and you can't, for example, do roads.
You have to be both done at the same time and you have to be competent to you.
Not the primary needs to do everything.
We need to cancel the model of the primary father, who comes and bats with the pump in the table and solves everything.
No.
We're a team.
The primary is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attach people from the IT area who can explore the party?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, to have an imperfect reputation, to be clearly integrated and honorable.
From this point of view, we have no other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 100,000 people, or, why not, 300,000 who want to be involved and do something for the city.
Interview conducted by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache works in the IT industry for nearly 15 years.

The Rabla Tracker Program has failed
The Director-General of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Oltean Mircea, stated that the programme for stimulating the renewal of the national trader and agricultural machines, started in 2011, named and Rabla for trader, was a failure due to bureaucracy.
The Rabla Programme has been linked, there have been no trials in recent years, but it has proved that it was a mistake, because documentation was very workful and complicated for a row farmer, and approvals were too long and then the world has cancelled.
That program has been able to sell somewhere at 10 bucks.
"The need for treatment for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 kitchens," said Mircea Oltean.
Accordingly, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces a few hundred annual tractors, being the largest in Romania, and that the large competition is exercised by foreign companies, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It's a very big competition with those coming outside, all the world producers looked at Romania, knowing these things I told you, and have special policies.
"There is a large aglomeration, all producers exposing, coming with all kinds of variants," stressed Oltean Murcea, which stated that IRUM Reghin produces around 500 agricultural and forestry treatments.
By the Rabla Tractor Programme, started in 2011, those who holded old tractors or other self-propulsed means, such as the combines, could preach and receive a valued ticket of 17,000 leahs.
The red flag was thrown up.
The internal scrutin of labs seems more spectacular and more political, since the new chosen leader becomes his top of lance in the vineyards of elections.
So the red-aprinked flag we'll live and die under his falls.
That was a song yesterday, Jeremy Corbyn in the London Sanctuary House pub.
It has been a witness of many facts and swears - let's not change his color now.
Readers who don't know the melodic line of this non-official name of the British and International Left (The Red Flag) can search for it on the Internet and would not have been excluded to have part of a surprise.
With the discovered heads, let's swear with all of us.
The author of these rows is not even a admirator of the red signs (and not of those who flew them) but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn will be able to join the left yesterday with the morning, this loving poverty between him and the base of the Laburist Party will have part of a happy-end.
I don't think it's going to happen like that, but it seems to be premature to talk about the big and inevitable electoral breakdown, over five years, of a higher leader.
But now, we can refer to procedures: we have assisted a democratic exercise of an impressionant anvergure.
Not the British labs have invented the system of vote directly for the leader of the party, around the western left.
French socialists practice a more complicated system, based on reasons, which allows all members and compassionates to express; they also organized a preliminary competition for the designation of the candidate to the presidency in 2012.
However, the internal audit of labs seems more spectacular and more political, while the new chosen leader becomes automatically his top of lance in the vineyards of elections.
It is, of course, an issue of political system, personalization of power being more pronounced in British than the other part of the Channel.
Moreover, the voting was great in all three "circles": the members of the members of the staff, the members of the members of the members of the party and, finally, the group of the members (which received the voting bulletin after a summary of registration procedures).
This last group provides interesting information about the perceptions of the left segments of the British society, especially the formats of young or old, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to be more involved in the future by the signal offered by Corbyn's victory.
There are no sociological investigations from which I know too much about the attitudes of this laburist "external circle", so the precautionary speculation is allowed.
I think we meet a lot of similar attitudes to those of the potamos (Spania) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with the notice that they will park the traditional channels of the left.
If we intend to identify an "anti" vocation, it reflects first by refusing the central line, New Labour (for many, only a dissimulated form of the multi-hulit thatcherism).
The second component would be rejecting the leaders considered guilty of the two successful electoral failures, one of the arguments that they did not go enough to the left, that they did not delimit the fast of the time of Tony Blair.
The second reveals - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum for Indonesia.
If we abstraction the separatist message and we strictly focus on other political issues, we see how the Swiss nationalists have captured energy from a favorable public sector of the social state and animated by the aspiration of the equality, the addedness of the disarmament and the hosts of military implication against the courts, but it is still towards the new topics of the left: Propertyology, gene, assistance for poor countries.
So the Scotch labs lost an electorate to have, at least in principle, a privileged, but that I can now recover (see their enthusiasm towards Corbyn's campaign).
Like energy exists over all in the United Kingdom, but the old leader couldn't touch them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his call outside, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, "Aristocrat" laburist.
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than the anti-left of the southern area of Europe.
The term "anti" is too hard: "anti-establishment" seems to me more appropriate.
For your week we'll find more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps as a leader of a position.
We'll see if no Red Steagul will be in the Common Room (not for the first time), after the new leader's place will be occupied, first of the banks of a position.
Anyway, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is the first one - and in this regard he has even reasons to be concerned.
Manufacturing capcane with or without good science
While I wrote the article passed by my head to check on the net story of the former fighter and "Commandant Syrian Rebel Laith Al-Saleh" became part of the second place dedicated by V. Marin's "jaadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categoryes - "rebel" and "jaadist" - could do me from the beginning).
I didn't.
In the last week article (Europe, between repeated and "repeated"), I commented in parallel to two photos - the poor Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean coat and the actually: the two faced it on the Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as re-reactivated.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh we took it from the article "Syrian Guerriers are coming with the Value of Research" (signed by Viorica Marin in Truth of 3 September).
Monday night, I put a link to my article on my Facebook page.
March, entering Facebook, I found, among others, a handy trace from the friend (not only by FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscribe, but a precision. Laith al Saleh is not a jiadist."
In contrast, he's fighter against Al Assad, for democracy and that.
"It's so that you can do and manipulate the gross in the table!"
I have to recognize, I felt naspa.
As long as I wrote the article passed by my head to check on the net story of the former fighter and "Commanding Syrian Rebel Laith Al-Saleh" became part of the second place dedicated by V. Marin's "jaadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categoryes - "rebel" and "jaadist" - could do me from the beginning).
Because I trusted the truth, his journalists.
Instead, I had no other comment on Marius Cristian's dinner tracing, but "I have to believe in the Truth"
After that, obviously, I've taken the poor money and I feel debt to readers with the correct presentation of the Syrian story of Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest we found it in a material of a ́a`ldated Press (Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe - Syrian Rebel leader looks for Europe) signed by Nicholas Baıtis and Dalton Bennett on 17 August 2015 on the island Kos in Greece, where they noticed it, among the hundreds, maybe thousands of repeats, on a man who was trying to do things in the haos of the majority.
The man was the Syrian Shoper Laith Al Saleh from Alep, which "is usually to be at the command", while "he led a 700 rebellious unit in the Syrian civil war".
Moreover, Al Saleh, age 30, had "a house, a wife and a normal life before the fight that covered over 250,000 lives and put a third of the Syrian population on the roads."
In the interview given to the correspondents by the Press, Al Saleh reports that "all people want to leave Syria."
My city is the most dangerous city in the world.
Almost 70% of the town is a town.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (a extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, and I wanted to fight against everyone.
Besides the fact that it was given out in a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a meeting and more synist - with a man in which a Syrian enemy repeated": "I have seen a lunetist of the powers two days ago."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very disappointed.
From the more material we find that Laith (which means lion in Arabia) was actually in the way to the Netherlands, where he had a bear - was high officer in the Syrian army and then he became revolted and arrived in O° after he was severely wounded - hopeing to get asyl and then to deliver his family - the wife and a poor man of three years (approximately an age with the civil war in Syria, which was exhausted in March 2011).
Following this, Laith Al-Saleh would not have excluded a return to Syria to continue fighting for the Syrian Libere Army (Franced by O".) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (who loved the Russian), the State of Islamic and the Nusra front of Al-Qaeda.
A freedom - whoever wants to fight in Syria against not one enemy but three!
I gave more over a Serbian material of 22 August, from which I didn't understand a great thing, only that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists that come once with them: TERORISTI SE KRIJU MEJU MIGRANTIMA calls the title of a news from http://www.telegraf.rs/vest, where they are associated with Al Saleh with a bar, holding a Syrian steady in mâ and that re-entered in which the truck with "THANK YOU".
On 7 September, then, on the BBC site himself, Mike Wendling took attention to the case of manipulation with the helper of the Syrian puzzle: This viral photography cla_to show an IS fighter posing as a refugee - This viral pool claims that it makes an Islamic State battery putting in a repeat.
We find out that the poza (in fact: photos - the with Laith with bar and gun and the with the THANK YOU trick) was posted by a user on Facebook, which would be his user and asked for excuse in time.
Only before this, just on his wall, the picture with the two photos would have been divided by over 70,000 times, gathering a few thousand comments.
That's what, too late, the horse left!
In Romania, on September 9, Carla Dinu from Hotnews took the story with BBC manipulation, but the title was wrong: "A photo has become the viral appearing a ISIS lumpator.
Obviously, not the photo is, but the interpretation was a mistake, in short: manipulation.
