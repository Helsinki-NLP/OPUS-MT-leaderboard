At the end of the exchange, the bourgeois of Prague wascula in the negative
After Wednesday morning, Prague's bourgeois corrected its losses.
Transactions with CHEZ actions reach almost half of the common daily exchanges.
Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, Prague's bourgeois renewed with her fall of the guard, when she lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall of action at Wall Street.
The reaction of the market towards the result of the vote of the American Representative Room, which will adopt the American Financial Sektor Stabilisation Plan, is also admissible to us.
Shopping of action in Asia
Asian bourses will be a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if the indicators will succeed during the day of the loss.
The Hang Seng of Hongkong's boss lost four percent during exchanges, but later, he removed a part of losses and reduced the decrease of about 2.5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises after the movement of Chinese actions from Hongkong's burst lost 3.8 per cent, while markets are closed in Shanghai.
Sydney's bubble action lost more than five percent, but finally it was possible to reduce losses to 4.3 per cent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Bourse lost 3.6 per cent.
"The hesitation of salvation action in the United States will affect the world's financial markets," notes Joseph Yam, the head of the Hongkong Monetary Office.
Although Hongkong is part of China, he himself sets its monetary policy, which is independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong have the same level as in the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American Islators should quickly repeat negotiations and adopt the proposal for support of the financial system.
Otherwise, it would be possible that other countries would be undertaken.
The bloodbain of the United States Actions
Monday, the United States Representatives Room rejected the financial system support project, which would have had to dedicate up to $700 billion (approximately 12 billion Kč).
The islators thus refused the call to support the project of President George Bush.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the whole economy.
The American actions v held on Monday, a blood bath and the main indications of actions have known the biggest fall of the last 20 years.
Dow Jones lost nearly seven percent, having known a fall of such an invergue for the last time in 1987.
The vote was already lost, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
The Congress ceda: the US Government can inject $700 billion in banks
The United States Congress leaders and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial aid agreement to the US financial system.
It will be voted at the beginning of the next week.
The American islators have made a decisive turnover in the speakers on the adoption of a salvation plan in the form of a financial aid of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion billion) granted to the US financial system.
The success is not so sure.
In fact, before the final version of the Law and submit it to the vote, the Congressmans must conclude a number of details of the Agreement.
The financial system support plan will be examined on Monday in the Room of Representatives.
It is on Sunday to the Agency Re日s Barney Frank, the President of the Committee on the Regulatory and Financial Regulations of the Chamber.
According to sources, Wednesday as soon as the plan should be submitted to the vote at the Senate.
According to the economists, the announcement of the adoption of the safeguard plan should be a primary psychological factor to raise the financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which the market aid may be effective, it will follow a "disillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great progress.
We have set our different opinions on the form that the market stability package should have," the Democracy Nancy Pelosi confided to the Bloomberg Agency.
It states that the final vote could be made on Sunday.
On Saturday night, representatives of the Islators met the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson in order to give the Government a final form.
This should, with financial companies, buy incoming immobile assets that cause financial undertakings to lose significant losses and threaten the system's stability throughout it.
"We are on the point to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has significant initiatives on action markets that fall.
According to the Democratic Senator, Harry Reid does not evade, the islators thus make the Congrès a final agreement on Sunday.
They therefore want to calm investors before the beginning of trade in the Asian financial markets, which are held in the first timezone, where the Congrès decision might affect the exchange of Monday.
However, it is impossible to clarify with certainty when the two American Congress Rooms will vote, or if negotiations cannot remain locked at the last time, by such or by such a problem.
The islators hope that it will be adopted during the coming days.
However, the Law will still make changes.
The total amount intended for the system shall be divided into two parties.
The first 350 billion dollars, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
However, if the Congrès has the impression that the programme does not carry out its function, it has the possibility of blocking the grant of the remaining amount, in two steps: 100 billion additional dollars, then, to end, 350 billion dollars.
Mr Bush welcomed the progress in the negotiations
Although the Chairman can put its vito on this decision, the Congrès has the opportunity to put it in minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the programme, which consisted of funds for the recovery of bad immobile tickets, which the value falls, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were not able to pay their hypotheques, was maintained.
"All work is done.
The Chamber of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday on the vote of the Law, and the Senat Monday," indicates the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in negotiations.
His password, Tony Fratto, stated that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Short parachutes Limitation
The Chairman of the Committee of Senat Christopher Dodd, the Chairman of negotiators, said that the islators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributors against losses, the deficiency agreement, the implementation of the plan on the time axis.
The new law also provides limitation of such sustainable parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the programme and establishs a committee, which will ensure the supervision of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and have made important progress to a agreement that will walk and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides aid for immobile owners, who have problems to pay.
The Government should negotiate new accounts in the case of hypothecs she will buy, while reducing the debtor's threats and allowing those to keep their homes.
Mark: A Psychological Aid
According to Patria Finance David Marek's economic leader, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its performance will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that it is ignored what will be the mechanism and the price of the recovery of assets to problems.
This point will be determined to strike on the share of losses between the financial sector and the government," said Marek, this week, to the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is adopted now, or at the beginning of the next week, it is not, Marek, so important as this.
"It is much more important than the congressmen agree, since this week, that they support this plan and that they will dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, which provides the adoption of the plan, is most important at this time," Marek stressed.
An extreme fight: MP3 players against mobile.
You will be advised, how to choose
While almost all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It's the result that it's better to buy only a phone.
However, there are sufficient reasons for seeking an independent reader.
The choice depends fully on the way of use and requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a nice gamma grammophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, such musical products are not out on vinyl disk, and, in view of the quality, there is no objective reason for this.
Yet, if there are in your stairs of winyl disks, with rock art, jazz or blue, you are probably dreaming of such a grammophone.
It is the same as music during movements, namely compressed music, to say it simplifiedly - music in MP3.
There are also categories depending on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to expenditure eight thousand corners for a reader, as a Pink Floyd fan would have a problem to support listeners bought for twenty corners on the market.
Here are two extremes, among which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The duration of the bacteria's life is also decisive
Some high-game music players are capable of many more things than simply reading music, but this is unknown, obviously, of most mobiles.
No current device is universal as the phone.
Near the first functions, telephone calls and SMS sending, it is able to read from music and movies, to record these last, to have a variable quality camera and, for example, to use the navigation.
And if we take into account the artphones and the caterpillars, you'll have a small player in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator is aware of the meat and no television will take photographs, we are probably assisting a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not inconvenient.
More the number of functions you use is large, more the interval between two reloads will be reduced.
And reading music is one of the most important energy goinfrees.
The mobiles are rarely able to read from music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this number is just lower.
In this regard, music readers (in particular the most radiators) are just more perfect.
In the case of good market mobiles, count that they will play music only for a few hours.
If, in addition, you can call for time in time, seek, to be up, a second reload for the work - this is even valid for the dearest devices.
The problem will not be placed for MP3 players who are able, after a reload, of a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the less perfect.
Another problem occurs in recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a USB universal plugin, as far as all cannot be directly connected to the computer, without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know to take it without reduction, given the small sizes of memory cards used in the mobile.
With regard to players, you do not need, except iPod, any software.
It suffices to fill, through the USB plug-in, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the player, or then according to the user's judgment.
Some devices only show an index with a tree structure, in order to explore it from Windows, others are capable of both (ever, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more knowledge
In the choice of a specific device, especially interest in the life duration of the accumulator, the ability of memory, quality and type of output of it and, of course, the easyness of the command.
If music is primarily for you, and in the day you're going to listen only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, it suffices any mobile reading the MP3.
Practically all mobiles are able today.
You do not even have to take too much attention to music formats that the mobile or player is able to read.
All come to read the MP3 and the large majority of the music that will reach until you have this format.
It is part of the most extensive formats and other than it, the large majority of the devices can also read from WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less hard.
High-game mobile also allows online music buying.
It suffices to visit the corresponding operator's web pages (or the other provider) from the phone phone and buy the song or the album in question.
This service to him alone should be a convinced reason for seeking a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is mixable and, in most cases, limits to rapidly done radio tubes.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whatever GSM, Internet, or even online) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you have only to get out the mobile from your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 reader at home.
However, it is also important if you always have listeners or a handsfree with connection.
If that is not the case, you can use the integrated engines, which have almost all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main benefit of music mobile is their price.
The less dear costs usually less than three thousand.
For a price of three thousand crowns, a walkman can already be very convenient.
But in most cases, you will be limited by the absent of output for listeners.
The price of the best phones and best tools, also provided for an input for listeners, is not exceeding 15 thousand.
The readers, however, have the advantage of having a easy command.
Anyone who comes to ensure the command of the most root players - which do not necessarily correspond to the less dear (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command with that of a cassette post, carefully used in the past, or a grammophone, is evident.
There is no risk of risk in the form of a mobile internet which has been taken by hazard, followed by a large data transmission factor.
Select the device
Even less dear mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have a store for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand corners.
But take care.
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the dearest ones even get out with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and you still want to buy a good MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, a Emgeton, or an iriver.
In accordance with the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not cost more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are part of the most needing auditors, choose instead specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are provided by independent command keys for MP3, and this is so that the command's appreciation is approached to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one who went the most far in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the accumulator (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by a MP3 reader produced by one of the above marks.
A first operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators offering the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, we miss the same thing - a operator, which would force classic operators to reduce prices.
He may not miss for a long time.
We have already called on Mobil.cz on the fact that Czech operators are part of the most dear in Europe.
The Czech Office of Telecommunications, which reported that the price of a SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
Thus, after the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming resource regulation, a paradoxal situation can occur - the SMS sent from foreign will be for some clients of Czech mobile operators less dear than the country.
How is it possible that the prices in Czech Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to enter the fight.
This can seem paradoxal, since we have even three mobile networks and a penetration that exceeds 100%.
In contrast, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this case, Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Czech Office of Telecommunications (CTU), who stated several times more than in Czech Republic, there was no place for another operator.
It is probably true that a classic operator with his own network appears to have a lot of chance (thereafter, now he would only find difficult frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - a operator.
This is just the entrance of the operators on the mobile market that has caused a significant decrease in prices, which will then also react to classic operators.
However, before even the input of festival troubles such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those we hear today were allowed to hear in Great Britain.
However, it appeared that it remained from the place for such operators and that they could have real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we had informed you of the launching, in Poland, of the Mobilking Operator.
In only six months, this operator succeeded to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator of the country.
Let us update that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta Financial Group, which has between them the U:fon in Czechland.
The benefit of the operators is the opportunity to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be effective, they really need much less clients than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, relatively high exemptions from construction, exploitation and maintenance costs from the mobile network.
So in the world, the operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer calls and good market SMS, which is often contrabalanced by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile proposes at least two times less SMS than its competitors in Great Britain.
However, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, weakness on a target group can also constitute a good puzzle of publicity.
In fact, this operator is particularly concerned about men.
"The true men choose Mobilking - a operator who pleases and who they can trust," said David Seibert, the Mobile Entertainment Company CEO, operating this operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept could also walk with us.
Miroslav Čepisk, Vodafone's password, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most operators are based.
More than it is relatively saturated by the view of the service offer."
In Czechland, no chance, the mobile operators say
However, it is almost sure that if there is an operator in Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We discuss the extension of this project to success, but negotiations are not very promotive in Czech Republic.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our area," said in a telephone entrepreneur for Mobil.cz Jana Studičková, a password of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the operators in Czech Republic were, in any case, not favorable to this idea.
In contrast, they are trying to make their best possible so that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, who would so take a new step to become a real competitor of Television in the field of business customers, has not hidden its intention to launch a mobile operator for a long time.
"We have much to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunication services but also mobile services.
And the most early will be the best.
We have already conducted negotiations on this occasion for several times with the enemy of Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have succeeded in negotiating," the Pavel Kaidl Group's password said.
So the future may be promising.
According to non-official information, we may be able to accept the first operating operator from the end of the year.
But in the meantime, its creation is accompanied by a total silence.
"In this moment, we do not consider that there is a place on the Czech market for a operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to other very specific.
For the moment, no subject of a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," Vlastimil Srszeň from the Telephone O2 press department mentioned in its statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile Martina Kemrová's password states in a rare understanding with the O2: "We haven't registered for the viable and bilateral project intention, which could be based."
And she says: "It is almost excluded that a operator appears in the T-Mobile network at the end of the year.
In order to work in such a limited period, we should now have a specific agreement."
Vodafone rather guides its attention on the compliance of requests for its own licence 3G.
Miroslav Čepisk said, "We are open to negotiations with potential operators, especially in the field of spending and infrastructure shared.
That is what, we, means most of the customers' views.
The main Vodafone strategy in this area is the covering of a partner to establish a common network for a quick mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily comprehensible, the entrance of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease of prices and thus to a decrease in their benefit.
What, then, is good to facilitate the event of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to hear as the larrons in hell. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:phone also testifies.
The most apparent pressure on the CTU during the creation of the U:fon was the one exercised by the T-Mobile company.
It shows accessible information to the public from the web pages of the CTU.
Today, the U:fon is ready to use as an argument to not accept an operator.
Martina Kemrová noted that: "The competition on the mobile market was more recently enhanced by the marketing of a fourth mobile operator.
In view of the character of the mobile market in RT, it is evident that the introduction of an additional player, and particularly its services, would be subject to high requirements."
However, given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the infidel reference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems competitive.
However, it is not only the attitude of the CTU, which, in contrast with Great Britain and other developed countries, has not, unfortunately, the power to intervene in the economic competition in Czech Republic.
This belongs to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But this last adopted, faced with this problem, its typical position.
"The introduction of a mobile operator on the mobile market would be possible with the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the operator concerned on the location of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded for the present time, since the offer of potential interests has not provided sufficient interest for classic operators," said in response to our question Crisian Chalupa from the UOHS external relations department.
Such statement would not be surprised by representatives of operators.
But from a office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care of that that no one benefits from his position on the market, such a statement is more than deteriorating.
More than Christián Chalupa ↓ says: "In the foreign, where the operators are normally present, it can be found that their market income has contributed to a decreasing price of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure in the meaning of a honest market and price decrease is not apparently part of UOHS interests.
What is actually shocking is the nearly touching concord of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, if this is actually a hazard, is natural.
Similarly, a strictly identical price of essence to all service stations is probably due to the hazard and hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not mentioned signs of anti-competitive behavior, therefore he has no reason to intervene in a way or in another way.
None of the operators have dominant position, therefore no one has a higher responsibility for their behavior on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to operators are probably missing even the telecommunications regulator," it stated in Chaloupa's statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of discouragement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTU, which is a single market in the view of the economic competition.
None of the Czech operators have dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts propose another vision of the things: to ensure that the creation of a operator is possible, it is necessary to keep the network operator at every time.
And the mobile operator has a lot of logical monopol on his network.
That is why he needs to play a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least anxious for the UOHS that three mobile operators do in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar restrictions in negotiations with all operators.
Return responsibility on the CTU is a quite close tour in communications, through which UOHS wash the hands of the business.
We have already met this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to renew the Telecommunications Law, recently adopted, to enhance the powers of the CTU on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised to improve the situation.
This, the representatives of the UOHS must well know, but their interests are apparently different.
When no one looks, it can work.
This means, the operation of a kind of pseudo-operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains inconsiderate.
It is businesses which have their own price list of mobile telephone services, but these are only partly.
In most cases, it is a question of firms careing for multi-level marketing.
Specialized mobile telephone services are, for example, offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms are generally available only to elections.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company made before the operator is a classic company client who commands a large amount of SIM cards.
As a major client, it receives special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trade conditions of all Czech mobile operators are prohibiting such revenge.
"If what you mentioned, it could be a transition of the contractual conditions we would consider and that could result in a breakdown of the employment with the company concerned," answered our question on this issue Martina Kemrová.
Nevertheless, it is quite short that a step of such activity has not been reached until the responsibility of mobile operators.
Notely, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
However, the operator does not speak against such a procedure.
In fact, the activities of these firms are unnecessary benefits, and, at the same time, by opposing the real operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepisk indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of unnecessary customers.
Furthermore, these are obliged to admit that the SIM card is not registered under their name, so they cannot be fully disposed of it, in the way of mobile operators' customers."
But this is exactly what should be strange in the CTU.
Moreover, there is another question to the UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a operator?
The UOHS has relatively large powers to be able to deal with such activities, and if it does not want to satisfy the explanations of operators, which claim that they have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibiting it.
When we're not the most dear country anymore
As we have already mentioned several times, the entrance of mobile operators has made a significant decrease in the price of services.
However, practically in all countries where there were operators, classic operators were attempting to prevent their creation as soon as soon as possible.
The arguments used by these last were practically the same - a too small, even too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at that level that, in developed countries, the regulatory agencies, who were not defending the interests of mobile operators, but those of their clients.
Thus, by formal measures and by informal pressure, they ended the creation of a first operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory agencies are addressing this issue as a warm land powder, which is released by sending it to a close target.
Following the experience we have, we cannot dismiss the impression that confusion in their skills is more profitable in these cases.
But let's not throw the manche after the cognay.
If the cousin information is true and an operator will soon appear with us, the Czech mobile market may be moved.
If one of the operators accepted the creation of a mobile operator, the UOHS will only be difficult to remain incapable of rejecting (discrimination) other interested ones.
And we may stop calling more dear than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymne has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four performances of the new version of the Czech National Hymne.
On Sunday, at the day of the Czech Nationality, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new records of the National Hymne Kde homev my (Where is my country?).
The hymne has been recorded again by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bałohlavek.
We have four versions - with a man or female sole song, a heart-interpretation and an instrumental version.
Le chant is a sure couple of Catherine Priest and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the hymne arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Belohlavek views the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymnes.
As he had previously granted to the Czech rozhlas (the Czech radio), he chose to interpret the only versions of songs with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to take care of the two songs, as well as the heart, with a good word, so that you might understand the words, that they can sing simultaneously," he explained.
The Czech National Hymne will celebrate its 175th anniversary.
The song Kde homev my first retired in 1834 on the Places of Stavovské divadlo (The Theâtre des states) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), the Czech original room of Joseph Kaietán Tyl, accompanied with the music of František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
After the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple became naturally part of the national hymne.
It will remain one of the seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
How to sound the "new" himn
Private transports (MHD) will introduce, Wednesday, the puzzle into their billet system
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, it will be recorded in the history of Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Pragical Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers and buss will ascend to the metro, the first passengers, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have a electronic cup in their pocket.
At this point, this last is accessible for approximately 100 000 people, owners of the Opencard puzzle card.
The passengers can buy a cabinet 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time make it record on their cart in the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (The Transport Agency), which is located in the Metro Muzeum, Mostek, Nadraží Holešo, Angel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kacherov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility of buying cookies on the web pages of the Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online magazine can permanently forget the tickets in the metro stations, where they are still stuck in long wheels for the purpose of paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their cup on the Internet and record it on their opencard map in one of the 13 Mästská knihovna ( municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is a guichet with a formed staff available to passengers, which will help those who are interested in the purchase of the Internet and, in addition, record the cup that they bought on their map," said the password of the Martin Opatrny project.
Besides libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vessel of several metros stations.
What do these distributors say?
They are red, reminding the machines to compose the tickets and passengers may have already observed them in the Rostyly, Booovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská meter stations.
"Aujourd' Today, the city has five, but from here the end of the year, there should be four-eight," Opatrny said.
An auto will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
It suffices to introduce the Opencard puzzle card and the buyed cocktail will just record himself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from the morning not only in the capital but also around the city.
To know in periurban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the communities of the Central Bohemia to access capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pražska integrovaná dorera (included transports from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and regional validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the Philip Drápal banks of the Ropid Organization, which designates the time of transport in common pragios.
Periurban buses are equipped with card players integrated in the driver's box.
Therefore, during the shipment it is necessary not only to show the box card to the driver but also to place Opencard on the location specified on the side of the box.
The driver also controls the validity of the stored coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the stored coupons, there is nothing more simpler than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal completed.
The passengers who do not take periodic buses and who will not remember the date of the expiry of their cocktail validity can reconnect to the automatic distributors, initially used to record the cupons on the map.
This is about the device's will show information about the validity of their document.
The Sudetes claimed a referendum to the United States
In 1945, the Germans of Sudetes requested the integration of Shumava in the United States.
This includes a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská decká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the United States patronate.
In 1945, some German groups of Sudetes addressed the president of the United States with such a desire.
This includes between one letter preserved in a private archive, which is currently deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská decká knihovna.
The Germans of Český Krumlov in the letter prayed by the American president not to allow "schumavská junga" (south Bohemia forest region) - attached by Hitler in accordance with Munich Agreement - to be transferred to Czech Slovakia.
"We understand the situation and we really want to be sure that the words that declare that the American troops come on the German territory, not in oppressors and enemies, but in liberators," it is written in the letter, signed "Persons, to whom the sort of Shumava holds heart."
Since the racing in Tjecoslovakia is not promising - by knowing the Czech national character - that brutality, actless attitude, incomprehension, oppression and service, the writers of the letter ask the American President to take the protector of Shumava in his hands for now and forever.
"We can't believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign State to us, who oppresss and destroys minorities and has not contributed in nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the fourth million inhabitants," it is written in the letter.
The reason for which the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire of vengeance of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had doubt of the German opinion of Shumava, it should only be organized, the letter authors, a referendum in the region to establish whether its residents want to be part of the United States, or to live under the United States patronate.
Although the text contained in the letter can appear a little naive, some surrounding, it illustrates well the expectations of the Germans of the Sudestes of the time.
While the Czech Germans were at least concerned about the question of their exemption from the Republic, very few of them agreed to have such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and the Great Britain would go to Southerns a certain type of autonomy.
Others believed that they would just stay in Czech Slovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Czech Bu ́o, confirms it.
It was the war that was, as German of Tscheška Bu日, engaged in the marine in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the prisoners and placed in the Holstein region capture camp, tens of Czech Germans came to consult him to learn the Czech.
"They believed that once they returned to them, the cheese would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the German captives who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war considered that, after the Decrees of Benes, he would be expelled from the Republic.
You don’t think - you pay!
A emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most precious road security action in the Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign than to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The Office of Minister Aleš Rebiček believes that it will decrease the leaders of a dangerous behaviour to the flight.
This costing campaign 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on trading.
It should decrease the drivers of the rapid and alcohol at the flight.
But remind them too of taking the tissue before starting.
In particular, she wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorists, pittons, without forgeting professional drivers.
What's going to happen in the places?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also shows the "s" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don’t think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is inscribed in majuscules on the registration plate.
Then, in a flash of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
What must symbolize that we can pay from life an instinct.
The spots will "hanter" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by analogue campaigns in the Anglo-Saxons countries, where images can be seen commonly with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
It considers that it will lead to a decrease of the rates and the number of dead on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
The strategy of sugar and foot against drivers
"What works with drivers is the sugar and foot system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by winning time when they burn a red fire.
The fool is the threat of an adventure or an accident.
The risks must be reminded of the drivers," said Martin Kořán, the psychologist of the transport of the Hotel Na Homolce.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and particularly negative advertising, we consider psychology.
The panels indicating the risk to the drivers are already less effective.
"When a statistical panel watching against a danger is installed, it will probably be quickly combined with the environment and the drivers will not notice it anymore," Kořán said.
Olmert would make peace exchanges nearly all occupied territory
Ehud Olmert, the president of the provisional Government of Israel, claimed to refund practically all the territory occupied in 1967, including the West-Yorday, Jerusalem-East and Golan's heights, in exchange of peace with the Palestinian and Others.
He made this statement in an interview on Monday by the Yedioth Ahronoth Day.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all territories (occupated), or even all", said Olmert to the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we must give the Palestinians an analogue percentage (of Israel's territory), since without this, peace will not be done," he said.
He admits that the possible refund would include Jerusalem-East.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem, and especially doesn't want tractors and bulldozers to cut off his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will deny parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted by allocating the two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and tens of injured people.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mount of the Temple, the holy and historical places" within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain the sovereignty of Israel throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It won't work," he stressed later.
Retrait of Golan heights
Olmert also stated for Israel's retraite of Golan's heights, which constitutes, for him, an essential condition to conclude a peace agreement with the peace.
However, this would also need some efforts from the part.
"I don't propose to conclude peace with the solely based on a Golan retraite," he reported.
"The people know very well what they are going to deny for Golan.
They will have to reject their current relationships with Iran; they will have to reject their relationship with Hezbollah (switched movement); they will have to refuse the continuous support that they grant Hamas terrorism (closed movement), Al-Kaïda (terrorist network), as from Djihad (Santa War) in Iraq,” said the Prime Minister.
Let's see what comes after it: The stewards in the car are illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long car is prohibited
In the context of the tragic carship of the Student Agency near Padoue, Italy, the question is whether stewards and passengers can move within the car during the road.
"If we want to respect the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is opposed to the Roadship Law," said the Karel Hanzelka Transport Ministry's password.
In question, during which 22 years of age was lost, apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the way of the car.
The young girl was at this moment unfortunately sitting near the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats available.
However, the car can have an accident, or even brushing, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What it is important is if the car is in accordance with its technical figs equipped with places to stand or not.
If this station equipment is not approved, passengers must stay sitting.
Long remote cars Student Agency have no places to stay; which was confirmed at Curuálně.cz by the director of Radim Jančura.
"It is a question that we have discussed with the Ministry and at the beginning, he prohibits the movement of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got that passengers could go to the toilet during the road as they had their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores stewards
"There is no unique legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription is involved in this role.
On the other hand, no legal prescription also prohibits the transporter to offer services.
The road transport law only knows the term of vehicle receiving; it does not define its rights and duties," Hanzelka's password is more ambiguous.
Joseph Pokorny, director of the Department of Traveling Vehicles, considers, in contrast, that the law is adequately dealing with the problem.
"All depends on the fact if the car has the permission of offering places in his approval.
Everything lives in there," he said.
Cars are divided in cities, where there are places of standing and a limited maximum speed, interurban with standing places and higher authorised speed and longer remote cars with the maximum allowed speed and seats equipped with security circles.
Like in the plane, a expert says
Jaroslav Horien, expert in the BESIP (Road Safety) in the transport, does not view the movement of stewards to board as a major problem.
"The situation can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
There, it is not sure when a turbulence occurs, and the hostage of the air can cover the head."
"And, if the car would have breast-feeded, the laws of the car would obviously be valid.
Similarly as in a city bus or in a tram.
The carrier must handle the safety of stewards by internal requirements," he also considers that the problem is not resolved in the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only car transporter to offer stewards services.
He's getting two hundred.
Even after that accident, the director does not consider their office as a risk officer.
"Now, as soon as I have the impression that this is a risk-mechanism, I will remove it.
The passengers can receive their coffee and journal at the shipment.
This would also reduce the costs," he said.
The security concern is the reason for the abstention of stewards in its vehicles to the director of Asiana Alexeï Litvine, which, compared to SA, provides a very small number of lines.
"We have no hosts, we've been opposed to it since the beginning.
Soon or later it will end by a death accident," he said, there's a year ago, in Tyden.cz.
A big tragedy has arrived
A young host of the Plzeň region, who worked for the company for two years, died while he was on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using clignot and locked the road to the car.
The carrier of the last to try to avoid it through a brushing manwork, but he loosed it on his right side.
Jančura says that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards were sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is impossible to reserve these places, they are locked."
The company has a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the damage of the young girl's family, the Agency will not expect the court's judgment, but in respect of the financial compensation, it also takes account of the guilty.
A change in law?
Not Viewed
An amendment of the law, which is being developed for more than one year by a group of 30 experts in the Ministry of Transports, could provide precision on the movements of stewards on the car.
"Or, she did not have any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it is not too interested in bus, but rather in the point system, at the maximum speed on the airport and the use of the phone at the flight," said the expert Horein.
"The Ministry of Transports does not consider the activity of stewards as a thing that would endanger the safety of passengers," has concluded Hanzelka's password, indicating that car safety control is under the power of the police and the Office for the safety at work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois are based on Francfort.
The major words were not missing in the letter addressed by the WestLB Director Committee to the employees in the house.
From a union of Düsseldorf’s financial institutions with the Deka-Bank de Francfort, "the central institution of the financial markets of Sparkasse's financial group" could be, the Court of Justice of Monday.
WestLB would provide a double "competitive block" of a sustainable productivity in such a case.
However, such a relationship could be the crucial failure of sending to other concentrations in the banking sector of the countries.
This is what it does when a direct committee is trying to demonstrate its capacity of action in difficult times.
Because WestLB, wounded, is always a strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission but also the Federal Authority for Financial Services, which has recently recently understood the Government of the North-Westphalia country that the time was counted in searching for a future solution.
However, it has been a question for a while - too from Francfort - of a relationship between the Deka Bank, who knew Sparkasse clients of their investment funds and WestLB.
Certainly, the Chef of Deta-Bank Franz Waas reported in the presentation of the numbers of the finest to that he did not see any sense in the fusion of the landstrasse house with a land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deka Administrative Board, whose half is supported and by the banks of the countries and by the grouping of boxes, has charged the Director Committee to conduct speakers with the WestLB for common trade activities.
It could then act on the debt of the financial market, or parts of it.
Nevertheless, the speakers are only going to start, as it is said in the financial place.
It is not the first time that Deta-Bank, who, with its 3000 employees, accounts for one of the most important employees on the financial place of Francfort, enters into the game about consolidation of the cash cash sector.
In 2003, it was believed that Deta-Bank could join the Rhenania Palatinat and Halbab Bank.
However, nothing has been found out of this nutritional book.
As soon as the plans were made public that the Government of the Hesse Land had spoken against all Hellaba's participation in them.
Afterward, the two other houses did not join themselves.
The Rhenania Palatinat country bank was broken at the Bade-Wuttenberg Land bank in Stuttgart.
But there were always new treaties on the grouping of Deka-Bank with the banks of countries.
Finally, Günther Merl, president of Hellaba's Director Committee, spoke against any commercial combination strategy with its bank.
Anyway, the feeling that the grouping of different public institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election in the Land of Bavière has passed, a BayernLB union with the Bank of Bade-Wuttenberg could first concrete.
For Helaba, this is not especially a good news.
If the pressure obliged to new merges had to increase, the possibilities of partners would escape him quickly.
In the south, she would now be a younger partner, although she had even better resisted the crisis than Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The grouping of Hesse-Thuringe boxes and boxes, with 85 percent of the capital of Helaba, took a lock at the beginning of the year on all Union with WestLB.
The NorthLB would remain at the river.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one of the faces.
Another aspect is the question of how the different trade models of each of these banks can be added.
In June, Merl stated that the decision-making issue, which means the future capacity of the banks of the countries, should be assured, had not been resolved until that time by the German grouping of boxes of ships and vessels.
At the end, a WestLb's departure could have occurred, the depth which is obviously not desired here.
This is also what it is questioned in the letter of the Directorate Committee in place: in any case, it would be a global resolution for the establishment.
In what way all of this will be placed in the same pair with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank still be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the weekend of the Italians.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanied her as a little friend, and so nothing is like it, he said.
After them, near a tone of five litres of beer from the Caiser mark, there is a good bathroom barbu that shows about 200 visitors of the beer's festival which deep sounds can produce.
Elena board tape Luca, then embrace her.
From Bologne, they came to Verona.
From there, from the road garage near the new Garage Puorta, four buses take out at 23:45 tonight, `Destination Monaco, festa della birra', planned at 6 h30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for the Italians, in one of the bus traveling Brazilians.
In a parking corner, the South Americans sing hour and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also brunching, explains MarcoGuard, it's not for the Italians.
The bus belongs to Marco, which carries a long double bowl of fashion and lobsters at the wide silvered mountains.
Since five years, they are going to the beer's festival, three had already been thrown nothing than this year.
They go there night, stay at the festival, and come back at 22:30 a.m.
And the night would involve unusual costs, explains Marco.
The travel costs 75 euros, including the pot of welcome with a beer Kaiser, brased in the Bavarian cleanness law, disease insurance and a responsible for the German speaking group - Marco has made a language course in Francfort.
And the buss are already running the night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer yet.
Soon, everything gets calm in the bus, the travelers sleep.
This is better, they will still need their forces.
Pauses will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a lot of other buses with Italian registration plates make a little pause again before Munich on top 8.
On the morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six and thirteen hours as planned on the parking near the Teresa place, nearly 50 other buses in Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others raise themselves, Marco holds a last talk, explains the attack plan.
First: it covers the small yellow casquet.
The following is written at the left `Feast of the beer', in Gothic, and on the side of the Internet address of the Marco Travel Agency 'knowsersiviaggiando.it'."
Second: 'When the doors of the head of the beer are opened, we are short', Marco cried in the morning.
`Courir!' Return and book the places at the bottom of the tent.
'Don't forward, elsewhere we are locked, and not all the yellow caskets on the same, we must divide them into the room!'
The shope, Marco cries, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the consigne!
`Monday to security agents that we are doing good!
When you leave your places, they are departed!"
Third: 'Tonight, come back here for ten hours and half the pile!' Do you understand?
And that's where, it went to the beer's festival.
On the road, somebody kidnapped the yellow trees to find the road, panels, and even to a electoral show of a large popular part of the Bavaro.
We're trying to be ready to return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'week-end of the Italians'.
There are no precise numbers; 50,000 people are walking through the Alpes and running into the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would come from Italy this weekend.
The Municipal Police is strengthened by seven South Tirol police officers, by Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian red cross which makes statistics on countries where the Italians occupy the first place before the British (60 interventions) and the Austrian (approximately 80) with approximately 200 medical interventions.
It is especially appreciated by the Italians, that is the tent of the Hofbreu brassery.
Insomnia nights for Hypo Real Estate Actionaries
The German financial system is relatively stable, the Federal Ministry of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician uses the word 'relatedly' and that he thinks that the German ban sector would not be avoided by crisis movements.
This has actually occurred this weekend.
The financing of the bavarian real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE), near DAX, receives a billion credit from a German bank consortium to protect the market turbulences.
A person in the confidence of the situation said to Re ·s Monday that the aid credits are granted up to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate should now pay interests on the fraction to which it would be right.
The money comes from both private banks and from public law banks.
In the background, it's the Depfa-fire company who supports losses.
The state financing was a very short-term journal article, refinanced for long-term projects for which he had loaned money - which is not more possible since the fact of uncertainty towards markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95% to 2.37 million euros, and the own capital rate was also of 1.6 to 1.45%.
The current benefits and nets from financial transactions were, in comparison with the same period in the year, the benefits from the allocation of fixed credits and mobile values, as well as the resiliation of provisions in the credit operations had fallen over 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only because of significant benefits from the recovery of accountability costs from the former Depfa group, as well as from the recovery of interests, the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the deficit of profits of about 16 per cent has been measured.
Following its privatisation in 1990, the older state financial was a bad scope on immobilious industrial credits, which had later been branchized at the Aareal bank.
Since the classic state financing was not sufficiently rentable, Depfa was then more intensified in infrastructure projects and in the financing of projects between private investors and State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the company, Hypo Real Estate must take place in deteriorations that should have a essential material effect on the calculation of the wins and losses of the group, even if it is sufficiently flexible.
The fact is that dividends have been amputated.
For 2007, they were trunked to two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state investor and infrastructure investor since Depfa's race.
It is stronger than other refinancing institutions on the interbank market because it has no customer deposit.
With the failure of the Lehman Brothers Investment Bank two weeks ago, the allocation of credits between banks was again considered as tari, the banks accumulated their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs an annual part - approximately 50 billion euros - of Depfa's credits with a short-term refinancing means.
According to a Hypo Real Estate, the need for the group's financing is covered with the medium-term loan and the protected undertaking from the influence of international financial markets in the wide range outside the current walking state.
Other sources say that refinancing would be ensured by funds until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the HRE Georg Funke Director Committee explained, however, that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer take place for medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Establishment for Financial Services Surveillance (Bafin) are from the principle that the ability of the Hypo Real Group on the market is now guaranteed.
The bank's actors and creditors are only to expect it.
However, in view of the dynamic and impenderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
In addition, it is not impossible that it fails to finance throughout its extension.
But the opposite cannot be removed.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest, still at the doors of insolvency at the end of the evening, this salvation for at least temporary will not be able to ensure the spirits.
The course of action increased from 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
The courses of obligations, however, are particularly good.
While the debts to the first head are almost moved, second-plan loans currency fails.
The most touched are the older Württemberg Hypo investment funds and those who have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate Bank seemed to be previously an alternative speculation position, and their value must now be considered dependent on the stability of the international ban system after the net duration of the crisis and the crisis of the institution that has caused the crisis to be introduced into the establishment of the Depfa bank's racket.
As the emission institutions, governments and commercial banks are still ready to support the system, a resort of resorts in time can be assumed.
Or it will happen that no one will hope at this point - that the financial crisis may be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in view of the renewed sounds of partial nationalisation, the probability that approached security has become a simple hope today.
This should preserve insane nights, in particular, to long-term creditors on the decision to know whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use that to make a report of losses for the next years on the next tax on the income of the capital of automaticly recovered winners.
Sylvana and bottle secrets in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, must be presented for the first day at the High School of Tachibana, girls begin to laugh: Germany is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word thanks to Mangas - in her new Trade Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first course day in Japan.
What was I excited.
I was afraid of the way to go to the oil.
I was in Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I took the train 40 minutes to the High School of Tachibana.
I have to find the way alone, for lucky I didn't lose myself.
The beginning of the courses is not as strict as we are in Basse-Saxe.
They appear each other after eight hours, until at nine hours less than twenty, a table tour starts with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course started, it was to me to present me.
I am not like to love talking before people, especially before a 40-time class.
As I haven't had the uniform of the olive yet, I put an old cup of my mother's household, as well as a chemise, blue cups and black cups.
So in this holiday, I presented myself before the pupil, and I tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - I call me Sylvana, I came from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy to have started to speak the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all made low, laughing, and make signs, and I have always heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him thanks to my hands.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary to the survival of Japanese dogs and means "mignon, chou".
Then I quickly slipped in my place.
The girl near me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was a honour that the corresponding duty to sit near her.
The rest of the time was quite quiet, but when the gong reasoned, I was stuck in the rules.
Everyone talked to who better, laughed and asked many questions -- in this case, it's pretty difficult to understand Japanese.
During the pause, they all went out of their Bento.
My accommodation mother also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something different than the German mistressable.
I had rice in aromatic herbs, small saucisses, a concomber and algas salad, fruit and a kind of meat around Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan.
The things have a strange appearance and a go completely new.
What's sure is that everything's really good.
All right, unless the salted salt may be confessed, brirrr!
The Bentos are not only breakfast at Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and then is especially carefully prepared - in the hope that she can make a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read that in my hands.
I'm interesting in knowing if I could watch it here too.
"Why is Japan particularly?" My friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to pass a year to Tokyo.
Then I always answered:
"Because it's fascinating me, what?"
Finally, reading mangas is what I've prefered for years.
And to better understand the mangas and cultures that are there at a moment, I also started the Japanese.
For me, it was really pretty that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a low for traditions, usuals and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the other hand, Japan is the country of the most recent trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
The rats also have feelings
A rat or a cafard run away from the danger, does that mean that he feels scared too?
The neurophysician Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
But how can we verify that he proves the same thing when he behaves in the same way as we?
In the online magazine "E," contributions have been made for several years by scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles of answers to the question "What do you think you are true without having the evidence?"
I think animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else still could prove it as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in that case, at least we can hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As we turn to other species and address the questions of feeling or generally consciousness, we penetrate in difficulty practical areas because Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in front of a danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he makes death, fucking or attack.
Human beings behave in the same way, therefore some scientists deduce a subjective v.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our v* subjective to the difficult animals.
One of the aspects is that nearly always associated circuits include the Prefrontal Side Cortex (as a result of its participation in short-term memory and management and executional functions).
This wide range is much more developed in human beings than in the other primates and is completely absent from other creatures.
Thus, at least for these aspects of our consciousness that declines from the Prefrontal Cortex, among which the conscience of whom we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that human being is even different from other primates.
Another significant particularity could reside in the human language nature: a large part of its existence is linked to the language, which often means that his conscience depends on it.
In that case, animals could be excluded.
But even if the conscience had not to depend on the language, it would certainly affect it, so animal conscience, whatever way it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our conscience states.
That is why it is so difficult to determine what consciousness can be done with other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, doesn't let it be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed by our own experience, then his observation puts us great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the contents of the v , but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be easier scientifically accessible.
We could examine the processes of consciousness of animals without taking into account their content, and this is exactly what happened in the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualisation.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the nervous correlations of the conscience are more regarded than on the causeal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in the performance of visualization.
But what's the result of emotions?
I conclude that a emotional system such as fear is activated in a conscious brain of its own activity.
So what we mean as "fear" is the mental state in which we find when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its followers, such as the body's reactions) has live memory.
So observed, emotions are closely linked to the cortex regions that characterize primates, especially the Human.
Subtile degrees of feeling, associated with our voluble nature, are declined, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, distinguish and category states for immunity to others other than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio seems to think that feelings from primitive activities are born in the regions of Cortex’s body sensation and the brain’s troy, such as Jaak Pankseep, but more on the brain.
Since this network was not much in the course of the hume evolution, it could actually participate in transversal feelings in any kind.
From a purely theoretical view, I can't oppose it, but I believe that it is insignificant.
Pankseep claims that what looks as fearful to men and rats is likely feeling like that in both cases: how, though, can we verify whether rats and men feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cafard flew from the danger, but if he feels afraid?
In my eyes, similar behavior is not enough to prove similar vs.
Certainly, the helpful nervous comparison: Races and Men have similar brain troys, cafards by opposite do not even have a brain.
But is the brain troy originating in feelings?
And even if we could prove this to the man: how can we show it at the rats?
I think rats and other mammifers, maybe even cafards (what you know?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to show it.
And because their feelings are likely to distinguish completely from ours (which consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behaviour than emotional feelings of rats.
In all cases, progress is nervous in the measure where the same thing is weakened in rats and men.
As I don't explore the language and consciousness of rats, nor feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It could be judged as a short term, but I prefer to progress rather than constantly against a wall.
I'm actually a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, President of the EUFA: a time of gratitude for Poland and Ukraine
Prime Minister of Advocate Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The Government considers the EUFA decision at Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to guard, in relation to Poland, the European championnates," was announced by Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnistie for our country.
The work just started, and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the calendone of the construction or destruction of stages, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after time.
The number of stages for the European championship may be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose time anymore.
We must work at the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian Ligue Grigorij Surkis.
"The EUFA has always looked for us."
A more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The PZPN Polish Football Liga was suspended by the National Olympical Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The Committee meet on the request of the Minister for Sports Miroslaw Drzewicki.
"A real danger that the PZPN is not able to act in the rules," Drzewicki said of the Poland press agency PAP.
"We have assured the President of the EUFA in a court that the preparations of the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division Ligue have already been condemned in the seasons for the manipulation of obligational relegation; at the end, the beginning of the Ligue has even been deteriorated at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indigne contra-attack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her private life in an interview - and now she's worried about her ex: the Hollywoodic star Meg Ryan raised the wheel on her former adulterian Dennis Quaid.
He ecumes - and contra- attacks.
A war of the Late Roses for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two hollywoodian actors are delivered to a disgraceful battle - seeing and south of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan was expressed in an interview for the American Journal InStyle on the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis has been confidential to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have learned the extension of the troop only after divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thinking is in Ryan's press relations for its new film "The Women" - the history of adultery is reported.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on her confidential husband's qualification fell: it would be "Monstrueux", he said in "New York Daily News", 54 years, that "Meg remembers the story of our relationship and manipulation."
It would be more "rerettable", that "the pain and the divorce that behave a divorce for each child would be repeated in public" for their 16-year-old Jack's common son.
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid married and will soon become the father of jumeles.
This was his answer to the grip case: "In any case, my life continues.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that goes to the best."
The prices of aircraft billets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were less dear than the year.
In Germany, a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
Flights and hotel nights would be beneficial - this is the result of a study of the financial services provider and American Express traveller.
The company analyzed its reservations data for the first half of 2008 and established, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, a clean decrease of benefits in the second quarter.
After the hotel prices have increased for years, the hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities in average of 6.9 per cent in comparison with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities.
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6% lower than the year.
The trend was particularly clean in Paris and in Rome, where the travelers paid from 30 to 37 per cent less than a year ago.
The causes of all this would reside for American Express in the low course of the dollar that led to a "the desire of traveling to the American tourists".
Financial places such as Francfort or London would be even more touched by the recovery of hotel prices like industrial sites such as Hanovre, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, the hotel prices are increasing in 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
Thus, in the field of flight prices, the trend was increased in the first quarter:
As a result of the cheroz price, economic passengers have a average of 7.1 percent of more than in 2007, long-cour flights, very consumers of fuel, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of economic currencies have fallen in average of 12.5 per cent compared to the trimester, in case class and in first class, however, price variations have been largely less pronovalued.
In Germany, prices have experienced a more important fall than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 per cent.
The German internal flights were even divided by two.
The reasons for this price fall would be a flexible economic growth, explains the firm.
The request would fall from the land in many segments of the aircraft market.
On the other hand, there would be an accent pressure on the competition of the "Open Heaven" Treaty that liberalize the aircraft between the United States and Europe.
The sign of the stressed situation is the elimination of non-rentable aircraft companies, as well as the high number of aircraft companies that would have deposited the balance during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, SV Hamburg becomes the first of the classing.
In Borussia, Luhukay has not always been able to find one officials.
De Christoffer Klein. Increase. Agriculture in catastrophe for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player only returned in the game later and his upturn failed against the target framework.
His message was exactly formulated, he went out of his lips convincedly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," shepherd Hermann Rieger in the clothes of the Hambourg aren.
It wasn't a big thing in the clothes, the mid-time was over, and most of them were crazy in their place.
Rieger has been the HSV physiotherapeut for nearly three decades, and has played a great reputation as many protagonists.
And that's why his request was received in strategic places.
Cornelius Jol's assistant entry bought and lifted the powder to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the entrier's head of Hamburg Martin Jol.
So the orders have been similar: and let it run with this second purpose!
The implementation was missing.
"All wasn't very nice to see today," Marcel Jansen admitted later.
Bastian Reinhard would have "should also be more detained."
This 1:0 (1:0 at mid-time), the Hambourg team has to take it to a successful hit of the head by Mladen Petachta (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"This was a victory sala," resumed Marin Jol.
Hamburg SV celebrates this Monday its 121 years.
Last Saturday afternoon, the supporters would collect themselves, the blue heaven above the aren and the provisional classing tables on the giant ́ran, which indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without real festival.
"We know to take the back," said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubted that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the implicit character of the first Ligue than the domination of its HSV.
The team with her coming lately involved - the Neves and Silva Brazilians, the guardian of Objective Pet® as Jansen debated by the FC Bayern - forms certain dougly, but it does not yet.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol requested.
After the vote failed
At Wall Street, fear.
The first news of the failure of the salvation plan made the Dow Jones temporarily fall 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in the whole history.
Later, Dow Jones got a little crazy.
About 20:30, the most important bourser index in the world covered 10.579 points with a decrease of five percent.
Nasdaq's bubble index was 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points.
The most perspective of Dow Jones were at that date of American Express that lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with about 12 percent loss.
No title could be reported of benefits anymore.
Bank Goldman Sachs' actions accused a decrease of almost 10 per cent.
Just a few days ago, the large investor Warren Buffet was associated with the company.
In the framework of the safeguard plan, the means must be mobilised to purchase what is called hypothiatry papers.
However, the sum should not be paid once but gradually.
In contrast, the State should recover options on financial society's actions that can be altered coherently to the development of the course in order to reduce the burden for the Public Treasury.
The courses of actions in tourbillon in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not affect the concerns of investors.
The course of the action of the Great German Bank Hypo Real Estate is throwing down the Dax.
The United States Dow Jones is deployed despite the salvation of the financial market provided by the State.
Spectual lows of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank courses led German (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The action of the Bavarian Immobiliary Finance lost at a time three quarters of its value despite the operation of the Federal Government and private banks, the Commissary Bank accused a decrease of more than 20 per cent.
The Dax just dropped below the importance of the 6000 psychological bar and covered 5.839 points with a deficit of 3.7 per cent.
Throughout the world, the markets of action have fallen in genoux.
In New York, Wall Street would open with sensitive losses.
Investors feared that the 700 billion dollars of the Government of the United States could not be sufficient to reduce the financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809,25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 per cent.
The United States representative room intended to vote on the safeguard plan, and the vote in the Senat should follow on 1 October.
The other European bourses also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 had a decrease for 3.2 per cent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the Japanese main index Nikkei falls at 11.743.61 points after an increase of 1.26 per cent.

In the MDAX, Arcandor's actions fell after the announcement of an increase in capital.
The Private Bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed to 23 million new actions.
The multinational commercial and tourist has also shown that action will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
The shadow material influences the flight of spatial sonds
Since years, a mysterious phenomena has left researchers in perplexity: the shadow material affects the speed of spatial sons while they are called gravitational support manworks.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativeness is not completely correct.
Since almost 18 years, the "Ulysses" spatial sonde has flighted in the space.
As a result of iron fuel drives soon, the death criogènely threatenes.
Since years, a mystery phenomenon has caused a disaster among researchers - the anomalia of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manwork of space sonds, which provides additional elan in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, for example the Earth.
So the songs can economise many fuel.
The American-European research song Cassini-Huygen used this astuce, just as the Ulysses sun-sound.
This is what surprises researchers have been surprised for years: flying objects have not always behaved 100 per cent of the way it is reached by the general laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The sonds become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, the physicians cannot explain this effect.
They baptized him by the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that the theory of the general relationality of Albert Einstein, which describes the force of attraction of the material of space covering, might not be completely correct.
The American physician Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton always thinks hard to make Einstein fails and trys to explain the anomalia of gravitational support with what the black material is called in the universe.
"The black material could be responsible for this disaster, which is also near the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers know the existence of black material only for about ten years.
It seems to have an attractive force from her whose effect is observed on other heavenly bodies.
Instead, it is completely in-, it doesn't send or reflect any electrical radiation, especially no light.
According to the calculations of scientists, the black material would also represent a good fifth of the entire universe mass.
Tourists removed in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their ravisors, the tourists in Egypt should be released and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed it.
Sudan ravisors had required a ransom of several million euros.
Pensling the fusillade that frees, six hosts would have been killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were removed.
The redemption negotiations would already be committed.
The Germans are without stop in the kidnapper.
WE ONLINE determines the most important cases.
European tourists in Sahara are free.
This is what the Egyptian state TV, the Arab TV chain Al-Arabija and the Italian media have concerted.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian TV chain bulletin Sky TG 24: "Our concitoyans and other otages have been released.
We are checking their health status," Frattini reported.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians and their eight Egyptian companions are well and safe, announced the Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the excursion in the wilderness should already be on the road to the Cairo.
The circumstances around a fusillad before the release of otage remain still fluid: thus the kidnappers would have nearly ended up, the words of a Egyptian security agent, before the Sudan army kills six of the kidnappers without crying.
"The problem was resolved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
It was only to collect the otages, when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Some Sudan soldiers had cut six ravisers on Sunday in the border area between the Sudan, the Chad and Egypt, and had stopped two of them.
The charges had requested from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money should be delivered by the German woman from one of the otages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, in terms of a German mediator, freedom of otage was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the article, the ravisors wanted to release women's otage after the payment of the ransom.
The men are kept until the ravisors found a safe way to escape.
The German ambassade in the Cairo has made all comments on this story.
Abuse of a grandfather who led to suicide
A court was informed that years of abuse involving his grandfather led a woman to suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57ans, from Stithians, in the Cornuales, was arrested six years after having admitted eight guests of accusation for indecisive facts.
The Supreme Instance Court of Truro mentioned that he regularly linked his beautiful daughter, Stephanie Randle, during his child, from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Mr. Randle, age 34, suicided with her in Mutley, Plymouth, 1 April 2007.
When she lived in Coventry, Trerise had joined her and banded her before forced her to sexual acts, while her mother was working at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornuales.
His beautiful girl went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Mr. Randle, who was voluntaryly assisted in National Trust, was dealt with abuse that had been involved twice a week.
The general prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said to the court that friends had told that Mr. Randle, who was a good surface and cyclist, seemed "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "he lost every hope for life."
In April 2007, his true father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she suicided with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the nice father of his daughter who had otherwise, edited a letter of recognition that ended: "I attached him and the bands regularly."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are really weird as a feticist, your victim must have certainly been terrified, especially at the age of 7 years.
"This depleasing saga ended by the suicide of the victim.
And what's more amazing is that if she did not do this gesture, her story would never have ended in the court."
He: "I stress, especially as his father and his mother described, the effects of your crime committed on Stephanie for years.
"Not these, she would certainly be a happy, promised, and successful young woman today."
Conduit for the loss of official data.
The Ministerial officer of the Cabinet Office, who had forgotten secret documents on a train in June, will be condemned by the Officer Secrets Act, said the BBC.
The man of the Defence Minister was moved when he forgot two highly classified documents on a Waterloo train.
The documents passed in the hands of the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
This is the less serious sentence of this act, without any intentional intention.
The corresponding of the BBC, Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Defence Minister and the Office's Cabinet."
The salaries that cannot be appointed shall be accused of violation of section 8.1 of the Act, namely the clause for the protection of the information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the Ministerial officer be placed under the protection of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Secret Services Associated Committee
The documents he lost contained appreciations on Al-Qaeda and on the resources of security forces in Iraq.
It was informed of the decision, Monday morning and then transferred from him to a secret place.
Building companies in front of the B&B factory.
The British building companies could have to pay more than 80 million £ to cover Bradford & Bingley's backing.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.5 million Bradford & Bingleys.
The interests of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect the money of the rental, including 59 building companies.
The Director-General of Building Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles said he was "irritating" to know that companies and their members were to pay the cassed pockets...
The loan of £14 billion will be recovered when Bradford & Bingleys' hypotheches will be removed.
However, the interests that are going to grow at the same time will be debited each year to 700 financial companies that collect deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed the BBC that 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is irrelevant to see that institutions who have had a behavior have now to pay some of the factures of institutions that have been much less.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is claimed that each company should pay a proportional amount to the deposits it holds and that the intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury considers that the interests of the loan will be acquired in 2009, at £450 million.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million £ to fix the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Trade Committee of Building Societies, said to the BBC that this decision seemed unjust to him.
It is "irrelevant" to see that institutions who have had a behavior in the recovery of the real estate market must now pay much less than the institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, date of the first annuals.
"We must examine all aspects of this matter during the next weeks, to evaluate the options to adopt in order to avoid that building companies and their members pay this salted facture," Mr Cole said.
The interests for 2009 covered seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the whole year will be paid, which could otherwise double.
Since the building companies are non-actionary organizations, their members finish by paying the facture either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for accounts.
Milk increases up to five pennys per litre
Jersey's people must pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced she was going to increase the price of her milk by five penny per litre from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price that results in a increase of two penny in February, and follows a research carried out by a consultative company.
Detailed sellers must decide whether they go to their turn, increase the price to consumers.
. Before the fevmentation, the large price of Jersey milk was for the last time, in 2002.
An ex-Pm of Bangladesh saw the care
A court in Bangladesh rejected an ex Sheikh Hasina care request, which could so be arrested when it returned to the country.
Her lawyers said that the court had given her his caution because of its exam for extortion to a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729,000) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many of its addresses.
Khaleda Zia, the everlasting rival of Sheikh Hasina, has been relaxed in caution this month.
Sheikh Hasina should come back to Bangladesh for a few weeks, but her party, League Awani, requested that the provisional military government of the country give him its entire freedom.
Correspondents highlighted that the terms of its release are contradictory because if it is permitted to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why it could not remain free at its return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now call on the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request saying that she did not need caution because she had been authorised to go outside for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will present a call against the Order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this guarantee to return to the country to prepare elections in December
Sheikh Hasina should come back after 17 October, said a former leader of the Awami party.
It was arrested last year after the military intimity government had taken the power, but was released in June to take care of the foreign.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, does not make the objects.
Anxieties for the Afghanistan Antipolio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent immunisation campaign against polyo, due to violence related to the Taliban, stated the United Nations.
United Nations last week, a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
But she says that she did not contact the children of the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, South.
A port of the United Nations word said that this happened despite the Talibans' promises of not attacking or obstructing thousands of years during vaccination.
BSkyB loses the ITV Judicial Battle
BSkyB lost its proceedings in accordance with the Court of Concurrence Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its ITV rival transmission.
The Court of Concurrence ordered BSkyB to reduce its parts of ITV by 17,9% by less than 7.5%.
The Commission said that the participation of MSkyB in the past had prevented competition and had allowed him to influence ITV injustly.
BSkyB purchased its parts in 2006 after an agreement aimed at preventing NTL, now called Virgin Media, purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the BSkyB purchased parts of ITV seemed doubt about the effective independence of ITV, which thus encourages the Competition Commission to investigate
The Virgin patron, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and official of Ofcom were all contrary to this purchase.
BSkyB replied that the force to reduce its ITV parts would not be reasonable, and it was contrary, especially because BSkyB just rejected its voting rights.
New investigation in the case of American prosecutors.
The United States General Lawyer appointed a special officer to verify the issue of the licence of nine American prosecutors in 2006.
All was born from the case of the General Inspector of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical to the officers of the White House, the islators and the former General Prosecutor, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the tesis of lawyers who support their licensement from political causes.
The Special accusator, Nora Dannehy, will now ask if the officers who were interrogated during the investigation lie to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Severe potentially, unbased, conduct have not been completely confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General, Glenn Fine, in his report.
The nomination of a special ability to force witnesses to submit was one of its biggest recommendations.
The dispute begins by the radiation of nine American prosecutors formulated by the Department of American Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the Department stated that the prosecutors were licensed for medium-sized performances.
However, he concluded that the licensed prosecutors were not more criticized than their other practices, which urged some observators to assign these licences a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republic of the Congress, while others would have asked about fraudulent votes against the Democrats.
The American prosecutors are investigating and pursuing judicial institutions for the Government.
It is certain that they can be licensed at any time, but they cannot be for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, the General Prosecutor Alberto Gonzales, has been accused of being involved in this license case, and finally he released.
A number of ministerial officers of the Department of Justice also gave their release.
The report of the General Inspector was very critical to the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, explaining that he was "the first responsible" of these licences, and ended by "abdicating" his role as leader," noting that he was not involved in this matter.
Other ministerial officers, including the former Bush Officer, Karl Rove, have been critical to have failed to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epope must be honored.
The Rock Star Meat Loaf must be honored at Q Awards for its epic song Bat Out of Hell.
The song, who will receive an oscar during the ceremonie in London, next week, said to be "honored" of this.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title of the hit of the Meat Loaf album in 1977.
The night of the price release is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a selection limited to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of the Q magazine, said: "There are songs that past things like time and kind, and Bat Out of Hell is certainly part
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires a great voice like the of Meat Loaf.
It starts with a instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was commercialized in the United Kingdom, as single in 1979, classified at the fifteenth place.
Furthermore, his Bat Out of Hell album remained nine years in the classifications, and it was sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his true name, has suffered health problems in recent years, even undertaking an operation to heal his heart-healing, has become irregular, after he has fallen on scene in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngite committed it to concerts.
Then we found him a coast in the voice branches.
A Dark Street in the town, often forgotten, and Pout Etre Soon in Vente.
New York has hundreds of avenues, bullets, streets and other parallel routes, some famous, other only functional routes.
. Even some veteran taxes and long-term local residents are not able to give indications to return to Extra Place, since they have never heard it.
The street is located in the East Village and parcorates the north of the First Street to not confund with the Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
From approximately 30 feet width for 120 long, it resorts to a dust rather than to an active artery.
No panels indicate the street.
It is impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
However, this street has admirators.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of the recent luxes on the First Street.
He would like to repair Extra Place, and create a more liquid passage to stores and boots, which should be opened in the new immobile.
Other admirators, including long-term neighbors, said that they were charmed by this accuracy just because one of the last and the oldest streets of the household patrol remained.
But the Department of Preservation and Immobilization of the city that manages the street does not have any interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood owners committees, the representatives of the city of Avalon Bay and Avalon Bay have prepared a proposal that allows the immobile manufacturer to buy the street.
But the Committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and requested a new proposal to submit the next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee No.3.
"There are only few spaces belonging to the city, and we would like the city to keep extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to replace and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to repair the small street and sit there, some would otherwise be used by a coffee where the manufacturer would concede the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made at the meeting of this month.
Michele de Milly, the door of Avalon Bay's word, said that although the company is going to explore the street, it does not necessarily mean that it sees to be the owner.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relooker this abandoned hall, and return it," she said, emphasising that it was the city to propose the sale."
Seth Donlin, a door of the Reservation of the Immobiliary, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, also highlighting that the Agency's mission was to develop property instead of to manage it.
Compared with his most colored neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a historical printing.
Some believe that Extra Place has taken this name since 1802, when the inheritance of the great closed inheritance of many Philip Minthorne's children has been divorced, leaving this small boat of land, which remains since abandoned.
The back input of the CBGB, a closed rock monument in 2006, opened to Extra Place; the street is probably more famous through the photo in cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was great," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
She was filled with iron, hairs, barries, posters, feeds and branches."
Some residents, including the bloggers who had already spoken of evolution to the Lux of the East City, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain.
Others announced Extra Place as a real rareness - a very similar fragment to the city that should be made in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, conducting a blog named Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contestations: A Record Nostalgic Ameryment on A City in the Extinction Process") reports the story of the City and Extra Place, which was held in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small-sac-sac-shake, day shadow as night, and delimitation by the doors of a round-rooted iron and perseans, full of newspapers of the last week that run through the gouters."
Without any exceptions near, the street is always the same.
A shortly stuck rat at the bottom of the street, near a gate that was ever leading to CBGB, and now became the seat of a chick clothing store.
Graphitis on the walls, a beer bottle of 22 pounds empty, is based on newspapers that just come to be cast.
Some people said that they would not think only rarely at the Extra Place, and suggested its valuation.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some under estimating the arrival of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they have been rolled in dark, humid and dego".
The Bilingue Debat: Inmmersion in English
In this part of the Education Surveillance Programme, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, ancient member of the study in California, and former director of the Department of Education for Public Policy Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-operator of the book "not as well as you don't think about it. Why should media classes be able to choose their school."
Attaching the favours of the Spanish voters is a complex business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr Obama's campaign stresses that "the African-American and Latin students have less chance to diplomate than the white students."
In order to combat these differences, Mr Obama's educational programme supports, in particular, among so many other subjects, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn it.
The question for Obama is, however, to know whether its desire to perform a bilingual education that defends the education in other languages than it was, is more interested in eliminating differences.
For example, Sexth Street Prep, a elementary school from the east of Los Angeles.
Students in this school are largely Spanish, and low income.
More than one third of the students, which consists of many new arrivals, studys the age.
Among CM1 students, 100% have passed the 2008 Math State review, expert level.
Similarly, nearly 93% of the students have passed the review of languages-d'arts
This incredible success has been achieved by another ingredient than the advanced by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street has made analyses, practice, constant evaluation of capacity and an example of attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reported by Linda Mikels, the Chief of the Sixth Street, this school has initiated the teaching of the English "full immersion".
Total inheritance in English focus on the nearly constant use of the instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, contrary to the bilingue education, said to me, "We had a great success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without his class, you wouldn't have had any chance to identify it."
"It works," she observes, "that worked for us"
Mr Obama should not take an example of the Sixth Street Prep and reply to it in other schools composed of most Spanish students learning.
The excellent results of this school are talking about themselves; but the education policies inside its party (the national educational activities have long supported bilingual education) and its great support for bilingual education, thus obscure the progress of Mr Obama's response.
Although it is favourable for immigrants to learn how it is, Mr Obama has recently considered this issue as an insignificant, when he declares that we must stop poliming on the labelling of laws in English.
"Instead, he said, "You must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, he should consider with care the education models that work, rather than delay them or consider them insignificant.
Pure Chute of Petroleum Following the New Anxieties of the Economy
Oil prices have just fallen on Monday, because people are afraid that the plan of safeguarding for financial steps does not succeed to restore life to the economy.
Operations at the end of the brute oil, 7 percent arrived at $99.80. The Mercantile Bourse of New York, at winning this morning.
Prices have fallen more than $20 in the bar since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the markets of primary materials have been cut off by Wall Street's financial attitude, as well as by two powerful uragans in the Golf of Mexico.
After known in July, an increase of $145,29 in the bar, the prices fell up to $90 in the bar in this month, before rebounding the deep incertainties of the financial markets.
On Monday, investors are again anxious despite the safeguard agreement, the largest of the history, that week end by the leaders of the Congress.
The news was decreased by the recent concerns that would be a sustainable crisis.
In the last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will purchase the Wachovia Corporation operations, stated the Government this Monday.
At the same time, Belgian, Netherlands and Luxembourg governments have nationalized the European Financial Conglomerate, Fortis.
The Barclays Capital analystes said that the frantic negotiations of this week end, concluded with the salvation agreement, have not been able to make the market revive."
While the economic situation is delayed, the request in primary materials, including oil, should be relaxed.
"the prospect of global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain" wrote Deutsche Bank analystes in a letter to their investors."
"We believe that the main materials will not be able to escape from this counterparty.
"With the main materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and particularly in China."
The bank's analystes reduced their expectations for the next year, given the loss of oil consumption due to economic growth, thus were required to reduce 20 per cent, oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Festival of the Second Time Determining for The Enhancement of the Team Record.
After having passed at the last eight samples, more than any one in uniform of the Jets Shaun Ellis, the defendant thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time when the Jets transformed a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second time started after the Jets and the Ar’na Cardinals were solemnly played under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre succeeded to pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, signing a precursor of one after midnight during which their relationship has made a lot forward.
Favre found Coles for two other touchdowns, the first when a back corner fell and the second, at 10 seconds of the mid-time.
"I'm not out of my area" Favre said about all its steps in Coles.
"It's a medium player"
"We're very good, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played the catch, the defence was the quarter back of the Cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost tire and made 32 yards up to touchdown.
Eric'ith made another step and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ballon escape because of Warner.
In the last change, the loss of Bowens' ballon could be the most charming event
The Cardinals took the control of this property during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ballon, Jay Feely made a target of 20 yards taking a benefit from 34 to 0.
It was the best Jets could have marked for a while.
"The Jets Coach, Eric Mangini, to whom we were asked to describe this crazy, said "the second time or the third?"
When the two Jets said to him, they left 21 instabil points in the third time- Mangini said, "I can tell you that I've more appreciated the second time than the third.
." Many points have been marked in a short time."
Running beauty, over its world record.
Heil Gebselassia, Ethiopian, has again proved to be worthy of his title of the best backward of the centuries, following his own record of the world at the Berlin Marathon Sunday, thus become the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory at 2:03:59 of an accommodating course on the plate, Gebsellassia held 27 seconds his record at 2:04:26, discussed last year in Berlin.
At 35 years, Gebsellassia received the 26th record from the world from his great career during which he received the championship from the world or the world record for any distance, from 1600 metres of the marathon.
The last month, Gebsellassia had missed the olympical marathon of Beijing, fearing - may be exagered in the eyes of today - that air pollution does not face its asthm problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect-time conditions, 48 degrees in the department, 55 in the architecture- Bersellassia wins Sunday, now a impressionant average of a billion in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track curriers such as Gebslassia and Paul Tergat, both canaanians, converted into background curriers, have contributed to the reduction of the record of marathon more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday victory, Gebsellassie told reporters, suffered cramps in the molecular two weeks ago, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest has allowed him to stay, but not round.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"All was perfect.
I gave me the last week, and today I had doubts; but at the end, everything went for the best."
It was reproached in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia - to have too orchestrated its courses, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the livers as if they were in a track competition, and considering more world records than the sense of competition.
However, this criticism does not reduce the size of the ability of Gibraltar as a background currency.
Saturday, Gebsellasia, held by four Kenyans, recorded a time at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite curriers, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to defeat Gebsellasia after the heads were disappeared.
With a little more than three miles of the archery, Gebsellassia made its final rebound to delay from Kwambai, which ended at 2:05:36, improved its best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived at 2:07:48.
In the female course, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now German citizen, has completed a marvelous year receiving the seventh time at 2:19:19.
Paula Radcliffe holds the world record at 2:15:25.
At the last time, Mikitenko was 36 years old, everyone was surprised in London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She doesn't want to participate in Beijing games because of a bad hypothetic at the back, but promises to win in Berlin, improveing her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
It was running to a able strategy, allowing the Ethiopian and Kenyan couriers group to take a great benefit , then over 18 miles later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived at 2:21:31, while Helena Cyprus, Kenyana, ended at 2:25:01.
In a town in Part, the Orgueil and the trials of the Black Vie
Hidden in the development of his large park, some thousands of the isolated, orlando, is a small quiet city where the proudness and complications of African experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first city totally black to integrate, the childhood house of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935 is no longer so simple to do of our days." The city at five lakes, three shorts of crochet, 300 feet skin, 300 good nageurs, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
She has now become a town of perlerinage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Zora Festival, who stays every year in Eatonville, to make a homage in Hurston, the most famous Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city that she described - became tourist through its inclusion in the tourist guide of Florida, published by The Depression- Era Federal Writers' Project - remains a place apart.
She is also independent, dignified, and private that she wasn't already in the 30s, when Hurston told that Florida's black rural population was often refusing to share its true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, don't know what he loses."
Although this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has called an open dialogue on the theme of the race, many here remain in the view of the foreign.
"We are very deep about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, resident forever and the oldest paroisian in the city.
"It must be in accordance with the reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triomph and fighting.
It represents at the same time a historical model of the power of black and a community of nearly 2400 people where the poverty rate is two times the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of Southeast black rural culture - sometimes decayed, sometimes claimed - which reminds the birth of the American slavery.
What would explain why the residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her birthtown through the world through sincere books, full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida's guide transformed this city, just at Route 17 out, a road crossing the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which is in the chapter of the black history and human drama.
Audacious as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the property store of the first master of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divorced in several private parties.
"from the road on the left," she wrote, "you will find the modern marron and white school, with its gardens and these well-conserved game areas whom Howard Miller always took care of, although he knows almost read and write.
She also mentioned the new Widow Dash husband and wrote that Lee Glenn was sold drinks of all kinds and all that can serve passenger people.
So, almost a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with an auto-government, but also with analphabetisation, remaking, and sex.
Obviously, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone appreciated.
Zora well described the reality "declared Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's young girls that Horston immortalized, quoting songs without color, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She said: "Some people haven't appreciated."
We always remember Hurston as a living and antrician person, who often returned after his family was denied to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, reminded that Hurston came from a city habit without warning, at the board of a large Chevrolet, a cigarette to the mouth and brought bottles here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many were moving about her.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also balanced in his box of the later patio that gives on the Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "he never remained too long."
At Hurston's death in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was ever a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman of the Barnard College of the 20s, she was buried in any funeral in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she saw.
In Eatonville, no large memory, nor place for the great public.
I don't think they have understanded the contribution or heritage she offered to the world " said Valeri Boyd, author of "Wrapbed in Rainbows", a Hurston biographic in 2003.
A crucial time occurred in the 1980s.
Officials of Orrange County wanted to pass five routes in the city to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the main street in two ways of the community.
The development of Orlando has already moved Interstate 4 to the west angle of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville just returned from a difficult period of his history.
A forced integration, among so many other things, has ended the isolation relatively idylic of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute on the mixture of races led hatred to the gates of the community.
"In that time, a band of white young people came to launch orans or objects against people sitting on the side," Mr. Franklin said.
"A lady is even dead."
And they made it a feast of their cars .
In a letter from 1955 addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston doubts the request of the Supreme Court aiming at a forced integration, which defines its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insultant rather than glorifying my race".
The residents now claim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in certain aspects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and has weakened the confidence of young people.
"The black kids had the habit to be embraced -- I remember -- we were embraced our master in the morning, and evening," said N.Y. Nath, Ella Dinkins daughter, as well as the leader of the Security of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
It took place until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You don't embrace your white teacher because he's white-- I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here " said Mrs. Nath.
Civil rights, otherwise, have allowed to create space for many other black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the damage, such as she, armed with a joyful own trust and conduct lines such as:" how can they disappoint my company's pleasure!"
That's over me."
In 1975, Alice Walker went on the anonymous grave of Horston and started fighting to make her reputation renew.
Five years later, a biography accused of Hurston, performed by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintrodued it to the American canons.
The project of the Watchtower just arrived at the time the most famous girl in Eatonville had found her attractive.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston viewed her as a saver.
The community began to organize a Hurston festival to demonstrate the disaster consequences that would lead to this autoroute.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years after, and many return to January to memorize it.
After many years, the counterfeit rejected the proposal of the Watchtower.
"The five-way five-road-fiasco, extremely quick, a real civil proudness," said Melle.
Mrs. Boyd summarized all the statement that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the project of the output allowed him to change his own image.
No residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer of our church since 1993, as they came in a large number, and the residents began to consider the past.
Eatonville has been classified historical city since 1998.
A monothema library (obviously renamed Hurston) will open in 2006 on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repeated.
Today, Eatonville remains an analysis for Florida: at six thousands of Orlando, she can at any time be viewed as a back street at a time of steady rain, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
( 90 percent of black are counted today)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, his reason to be, are still treated with mind.
You need to ask permission for most interviews, and some things - such as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Miles Jones, a courageous teacher and who has a low for the living red, are always afraid that their island community is not well comprehensive.
However, having regard to the expansion of Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride is embarrassed.
Youths, particularly, are tending to view Eatonville as Hurston as his whole race: beautiful, problematic and all, not better or worse, but also proud, creative, bossuous, foolish and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is good for the genuine civil affection that we hear in Mr. Franklin's neighbor's voice, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who intends to return to Eatonville after the eye to work for the local government or police forces, which need additional forces.
And even for younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11 years, winter Park jumeals, have learned correctly the description of Eatonville.
"The majority of people that passed in this area will think:" oh, this city has not compared anything to others." Alondra Kenon said after the last Sunday meat.
But if you stop and take time to contempt the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone talks coolly financially.
Nevertheless, nothing changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan stayed remote from kiosk and genuine television screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the eyes of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and appeal offices above their head, the bans and the cover fund managers that monopolize New York passed the worst "work day to the office" since the crack of 1929.
The suppliers continue to fascinate on the trottoirs, with their cars and their muffin tables for the morning meetings.
Latins always travel between residential immortals with, like mules, a fifty luxual chemises pending a yog on its shoes.
Office employees continue to make the cup to buy their morning sandwich to walking goods, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16 and 19 hours a week.
I didn't feel the crisis despite the completely pessimist stories until this after midnight when I decided to open a new spare account.
Happy that I was planned to work at the end of the midnight, because I had discovered at my local office of JP Morgan Chase, a 20-year-feeding person.
Not in front of the ships, nor in order to get back from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service guichet, where the customers commanded their demands, tourists asked the direction for the Macy magazine, and new customers would open accounts.
Most of those before me, I would learn later from Starr, my "autorised personal bank", were all doing the cup for the same reason as I.
Not the same way, because they have already recovered their economy from smaller banks, such as those of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They recovered their money from the bank accounts called thrifts (including a building company), the credit rate, and the type of local spare boxes and their branches that work only in a state, and who say to treat customers as their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have failed.
The last days, Washington Mutual, a capital bank of $327 has made a faillite syndicate, and when the New Yorkians would return home for the weekend this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, at the accounts of a value of $440 million, he was unexpectedly looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and the employees of magazines that are before me, feared of another potential deficit, transfered their money to a trusted bank, or the one who makes the most salvation at Wall Street.
New Yorkians have become very familiar in the world of the finance in recent weeks.
"I had a lady to my Chinese supermarket, talking to Lehman Brothers' phone, the bank that made a failure, and her Major Director-General Dick Fuld, with the same knowledge she could have had to criticize a criticism.
And Lyn, the uniform concierge of my immobile, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries of my fruit and vegetables goods.
She told me after my visit to the bank. "I put all my economy on the market of money funds.
"I've changed, I don't want to risk."
Muslim tombs profaned while Austria screw down to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right side of the Austrian Freedom Party party and Philip Dewinter from the Belgian Right Vlaams Belang, takes part in a manifestation to present the "towns against Islamisation" organization in Antwerp, Tuesday 17 January 2008.
They carry road panels that illustrate red rayed muscles.
The police accuses the extremists of the right to have profaned an Austrian Muslim cimeter, the weekend of the victory of extreme political parties Droite to the general elections of the country.
More than 90 tombs were severely damaged at Traun's cimetery, near Linz, between Friday and this morning; it was the police of a organized action.
The criminals have drawn on several graves, Jewish symbols such as David's Star; the detectives, however, think that it could have been done to disappoint the feeling of the extremists to the Muslim immigrants.
This accident could be somehow related to elections.
A door of the local islamic community said to be "deeply shocked" in the announcement of this profanation, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan, which touches its end.
Austria thinks seriously to find her courage, after his occilation to the right in Parliamentary elections last night.
The two extreme parties who discussed almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered critics, such as xenophobes.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18% of the votes, took his campaign against the port of the foulard and of the burkas, and even expressed his opposition against food alaha.
His final course in Vienna, he spoke of "European brotherhood" to avoid the creation of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and mines, declareing that they would be a political symbol of the islamisation of Austria and Europe.
The surveys and analysis made just after elections have defined the extreme right as the strongest political block in the country, which is shown by the majority of young voters who have made the difference, because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter prohibited travel to the foreign.
The courts prohibited the rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse on children, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates have made a six-month prohibition to Glitter, after expressing it to the authorities under control, his intention to go to Spain by France.
The police to Kent had granted this prohibition to travel on Thursday after showing the judges that Glitter was guilty of sexual abuse on child.
Glitter, or his true name, Paul Gadd, was not present in the audience of Ashford's limited courts, but was also represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A door of the court stated " Thursday 25 September at the Court of Ashford, Kent's police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't present then."
Glitter, 64ans, informed the authorities that he wanted to go to the foreign, remaining recorded in the list of sexual abuse accusations.
It must comply with the authorities if he wants to go to the foreign for more than three days.
It must also inform the police, 7 days before its scheduled department.
If he doesn't make his movements to the authorities, he could purify a penalty up to five years of prison.
The police of Kent stated that she would not discuss specific cases or potential movements of Glitter in the account.
A door of the Kent Police's words said, "Kent's police will do everything necessary to protect our children as foreigners.
"only we, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have devices able to manage any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"Protection of the Kent is the most dear intention of the Kent Police, and we watch closely the behavior of those who are accused of sexual abuse in the region in order to minimize potential risks for the public."
. Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after purchasing 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls from 10 and 11 years respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane for Bangkok from where he would have to ship for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel good, and he went to London.
The Thai authorities blocked it to the passport control, and finally he went to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities made him the entry into their territory, and therefore was required to leave to Bangkok; the Thai police and the immigration officers insisted that he returned to the land.
He finally arrived at the Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August and, while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the restricted court of Uxbrie, West London, for the registered in the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, such as Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been cleaned a four-month penalty in the United Kingdom, for the detention of abuses on child.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqui­ith, the Minister of Interior, was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been prohibited from movements in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the scene to catch elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photograph
We're not taking a tail, neither internet clothing.
The essence of the great masters of the flamenco, released from all pressures for ○ the aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the intimate, in these moments of the great public, where intimate gestures and stealed views of artists are covered that are not concerned to ascend on scene.
The German Günther Bauer mixed the theatership of some scenes with songs, dancers and gu’ests with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photograph represents the special economy of the flamenco under different angles.
Included in the programming of the Moon of the Flamand Photography, the expression "respects the international importance of Flamenco, greater every day", explains the Creator, which explains that "Flamenco - people" "can be anybody but, after having seen the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on the scene of passion, triumph, joy... by the public.
To catch instants of personality of these artists, you don't have to make photos on scene.
They have a personality and a personal character.
What I was interested was to create an intime atmosphere that allows me to catch with the camera of the instinct instants of the flamenco stars. "
With the festival "Popular Chant of Mines", Bauer started a long journey in 1997 to photograph the songs, gu'ests or dancers with a flat camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the selection of the camera and material, remind the classic photograph.
The implementation of various methods broken with the classic side of the image, giving him a touch of modernity, reflects the perception of the flamenco _ Bauer: "A music with very traditional racines that develop and surprise each day."
It is not the dance or song in himself, but the personality and the character of the artist who makes the public with his art.
The search for the essence and magic was the constant work that we presented at the El Fotómata gallery in these days.
Flamenco's seeds like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyo, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among other things, are part of the selection made from about 60 photographed artists.
The project was transformed into anthology of the flamenco, which will soon be taken into a book of collection of portraits exposed to the gallery.
The passion for the portraits of Bauer led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Sportart Project Portraits of Old Sports" ("Sportart Project").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photograph admits that he loves the photographer would bring it to people, know them and can enter into their life for a more or less instinct.
I think in the photograph it would be the most difficult type.
You're faced with people, persons you sometimes don't know or who's just left for a few minutes to be able to make them a photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photograph, I always try that my ideas become real."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco named "Flamenco - people" is exposed to the Galerie El Fotómata, which is located at 20 of the street of Mata (parallel to the Hercule Popleriae), which will be opened until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roman that he wrote is "audace"
The roman is developed in places that no one knows and handles subjects inconque, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to make the new project on which he works, a Roman who has for the main personship Roger Casemant, a Irish nationalist who has v · twenty years in the Congo and who has passed by Amazon.
The Nobel Price of Literature confessed yesterday at Hay festival Segovia, that the Roman who takes it now "is a real audace" and that "all shows that he should not write it."
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't, but I'd do it and hope to finish it," he concluded in his intervention at the exchange of ideas and thoughts that four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the dogs" was the most expected personship of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled its contract.
Vargas Llosa, who received the price of Hay Festival to most of the votes of the participants, made a room in the theater Juan Bravo.
The representative of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found face to a fascinated public who did not see the past time during which Peruvia, with a wonderful memory and with a great dose of humor, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which was due to "the seed of reading" and "the life of new experiences"; how he wrote of a "treatly methodical manner" through a intense documentation work, correcting and rewriteing a part of the text to make face to his "many of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspired his Romans.
The Spanish-American romance recognized that " there is no means" to measure and know whether the books change life. "But I believe that literature is a pure entertainment, a ephemer experience," commented Vargas Llosa, who said that this has "effects" and "reduce the less similar people" because we asked the writers "do not let them go to frivolity" and to take their vocation.
The bad time swallows the pool of Pozoblanco
The feast of the banders that concluded the rates of Pozoblanco's furnace was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse toreators had checked that the arenin was inappropriate.
In this way, the organizational committee, in accordance with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the collection of railways.
The bad time took place on this fever, because two feasts of three could not have happened.
Samedi is the rain that prevented the collection of the second scheduled road.
At the office, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who had to face in Castillblanco's area
Thus only the Friday Festival has occurred
Wednesday, the winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was brought into triomph, after having made arm movements in front of the tower with go ethnic and go.
The afternoon even Alejandro Talavante concluded on two bands planted on the back of the tower and a cut ear that the covered grains had applauded more than his fight in himself with the tube.
More worse for El Julie, who entered the arenes of Los Llanos without punishing or glorious.
When he was fighting the second bullet, after a straight-better fight, he was sealed by most of the public.
Police control of a furgonet in the province of Alava: two thousand kilograms of hachish found
Five hours minus ten of the morning.
Euskadi Police Control (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Armihon Community (Alava).
Police agents are arresting two employees of a furgonet and the last two are running away.
His load, more than two tons of hachish, is what to stop them.

The arrested person was accused of trafficking of drugs and documentation.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Trade Unit carried out a control of vehicles on N-1 at the border of the Armihon community.
They were prepared to stop a furgonet to inspecte it when the driver disobeyed the orders, brushfully accelerated and the control started.
The police started their follow-up until the vehicle stops two kilometers away on the lower side, where both occupants came down to flee into a busy area.
The Baskish police finally arrested one of the two employees and took the 2.178 kg of hachish that they were transporting and found after inspecting the cargonet, a Iveco Daily.
The last part of the vehicle was loaded of hachisch ballots, and then they were transferred to a police post for an exhaustive inspection and for drugs.
Furthermore, the officers found that the registration plate had been "falsified" because it did not coincide with that written on the grisy card of the furgonnate, so they have also imputed a detention of documents.
Ertzaintza continues his investigation to stop the other suspicious, who has succeeded to escape and determine the origin of the entered drug.
The prisoner, A. A. J. of 28 years, was watched to perform the various steps and will be judged in the following hours.
Heather Locklear has been arrested for conducting under the effect of a medicine
Actor Heather Locklear, Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for conducting a medical effect.
A witness saw him doing strange manworks trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, according to a port-password of the police patrol of California sent to the newspaper People.
The witness stated that at 6:30, Locklear "was back on the accelerator, making a lot of sounds, trying to get out of the garage car, and walking back several times, it rolls on its sunlights."
Shortly afterward, the witness, who at the beginning did not recognize the actor, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the morning and went out of his vehicle.
This person now called emergency services because she was worried about Locklear's life.
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actor sitting inside her vehicle, which partly blocked the road.
"He looked disoriented," so the agents led it to the specialized centre in drugs and alcohol to perform a test.
According to a police password, the actor was cooperative and alcohol abuse has been removed from the beginning, although "only the observation of police officers in the first view, we pensioned Locklear under the influence of a medicine".
Locklear was arrested because he was suspicious of conducting under the effect of a substance that was not SP and was imprisoned at 19:00 a.m. and left a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear went out of the clinic of Arianna, where she was inside to take care of nervous depression.
Lamazares requested the andalous Federation of the Union's Left to assume its responsibility in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator and Member of the Union's Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it was the regional Federation to make a decision on the case of the former adviser of the Youth and Sports of the municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who was released last week after having been accused of carrying out favor treatments to the members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the andalous organization who will have to carry out his responsibility," said Lamazaras in respect of the behavior of the political party that he will adopt within the municipal Council of Seville.
However, the Left of the Union requested that investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have done: "The Union's Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also highlighted that the political party has "treatly strict ethical codes for all officers".
"Singre de Mayo", or Garci
By inspiring the accounts of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci regenerates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de Mayo, which is the most ambitious film of his film with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The cineast tried to "scan the many persons and illustrate the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the Romanian famous, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarria at the head of the long list of actors.
The movie of more than two hours and half," Sangre de Mayo" will go out in the next Friday movie rooms, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid more than four hours.
Great admirator of Galdós literature, José Luis Garci, assured that he had done with this tournament "a dream of child" through Esperanza Aguirre, who loaded it three years ago, to turn a memorandum film for the two hundred years of the 2 May, something that he always accepted when the story stood up to national history facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Community of Madrid constitute for Garci a "unilateral opportunity" to reproduce the environment of "A Spain who missed the leader of the fight, since the fight for independence led the people to rebellion under the Government of Ferdinand VII," he reported.
But the cineast regrets not having received a finance as for the films "Capitane Alatriste" or "Goya's fantoms" - more than a double of the obtained for "Sangre de Mayo" - because he could not turn some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with which he had been with during almost all his career.
The filmist of "Volver started" affected his usual way of working, on the scene of the actors, with whom he has the habit to repeat before the turning and to whom he does not make casting, because it is "humiliating" to him and believes that "the role of the cineast is to go to the theater and to the cinema to be informed".
Many participants in "Sangre de Mayo" repeat before the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times candidate to Oscar (he won one), Garci believes that the three candidate films representing Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy," Sangre de Mayo", "Seven French billion tables" and finally the winner," the blind tourneals," are not representatives of the young Spanish cinema, "who would deserve better known," he said.
With this Garci movie doesn't have a price.
"For the beginning you think you're working for the seed, then you realize that you're working only for the prosperity, and now you're happy to make a more movie," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón is placed in the skin of the Sevillane Dance Tortola Valencia
A sevillane dance will also make a sevillane dance homage.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and a andalous mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), is born in Triana's quarter and will live in London with his family at the age of three years.
He was a dancer of free and specialist of the east dance.
It was a tremendous, pioneer of the freedom of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetary and pleaded for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of Dance in Europe of the Inter-Werk, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa_oa, and this last suggested me to interpret the Sevilla Dance Torola Valencia, and that made me incredible."
According to the dance, "we are not trying to tell his life but to translate his way of thinking.
The titles of her dance made me think about flamenco.
Thus, "the dance of the papillon" made me think of a cuban popular dance and "the dance of the serpent" of some tangos.
His dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same to her, "affirms she.
The scene was made by two notable contributions: the Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of its spectacles, as he had done to "La Porta Opena", and the of Professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally well-determined to sing with the one who was his .
"Matilde converts Tortola into a mature person.
I am happy because she accepted to play a role in my work and it honored me. "
The scene was also made through the musical composite and the guitars of Jesus Torres y° Arriaga, the popular song of Michael Ortega, the Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, and the violation of Rafa El Viola and the actor's actor, Juanfra Juárez, "which plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists considered as divas".
This work is also in a certain way that the life of this woman who has shown himself in so far places, especially for the time, such as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, because she was usually residing in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think these women have a great influence in their time and no one now knows and values her work," says Bayón.
The spectacle will start at 20:30 at the Vega Lope theater
The publication of the "Recently Married Poet Journal" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first edition of the "Recently Married Poet Journal" in the Saint Stephen's church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is included in the activities provided by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to collect the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to memorize the fifth anniversary of the Nobel Price of Literature and their death.
In this way, "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to its end with the revising of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This little light-plus" which was incurred in the last month of May and who, after traveling to the various andalous provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andaluzia bought eight hundred exemplars of the "Recently Married Poet Journal", edited by Pedro Tabernaro and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most andalous poetes with.
America pleases less without Paul Newman
" Sometimes God created perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is of the actor Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of evil", and illustrates well the desperateness of the American cinema, and from all America, faced with the striping idea that Newman is no longer from this world.
He was deceived to a Oscar
It hasn't turned since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a hard shot for everyone.
"It's sometimes what a feeling exceeds any expression, and now I've lost a big friend," Robert Redford cryed, "my life and my country were better by his existence."
No one was afraid to be ridicule or to exagerate.
One of the fathers of the cinema and the country died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and bursian markets are afraid, the estimation of the Americans has fallen very low, seeking unexpectedly the motives of dignity.
When the time is so hard and without reason to live, it remains human beings only admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He incarnated for everyone a ideal beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defendant of lost and winned causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drogue battle created in honor of his older man died after a overdose and the creation of his own bio-feed mark.
It was a victory for a country who was deceived to be imposed against a suicidary food culture.
This expansive admiration vague balanced Hollywood without taking attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel ́ig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another cousin, Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Crowe, was named Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He placed us the high bar," observed George Clooney, who may be the only today who tries to persuade it as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious and remote private life from the goals.
This is not always easy or possible in the median jungle of our day.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years in Joanne Woodward, who was faithful even if the opportunities were not missing for him.
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside from me, if I have a bifteck in my fridge?", had he the habit to pleasure.
In heaven, he proudly assists to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"For all the great roles he interpreted, he has never been so proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the grandparent careful and philanthrop," he says.
Madrid in the Olympical Games Organization 2016
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympics Games after the failure in 2012, that could be done in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of the course of yesterday: we're not!
They call it the perfect course, but it was the worst course I have never participated in.
If they had taken into account all errors occurred during the course, they would be subject to a deleting note.
But let's examine all in detail and from the beginning.
The errors begin with the retraction of dosars, which forces you to go forward.
It's not bad but if they make you move it would be better than they give you everything (including the electronic puzzle for courses).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the dossard (the first error, moving only for this) and (after a long row of wait) surprise!, there was only the 'S' size for the maillot (the second error, because I need a XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis they decided to buy that small-size maillots with less weight and less decent?
Well, this is nothing about what happened on the day of the courses.
Besides the fact that you need to go there very quickly to get the electronic puzzle back, the waiting row is 15 minutes and, moreover, you need to leave your bag back at the input.
The expectation was more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible since 11,000 people are expected for these courses.
Since there was a long row of waiting, competitions started, and we haven't left our bag back to the entrance, although once done, it was worse.
Moreover, the rain accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which there were rebelliousnesses and appeals of the barcake.
I think about 500 people will have the pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with the precise time, because they have given me who, I think, has not marked the outcome correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to quote a perfect example of course, this would not be my idea, especially.
So I think we can always dream of become the town of the J.O. 2016 host.
Microsoft searches for a receptionist (virtual)
At the Conference on the Evergence Technologies of Microsoft Microsoft has been presented a new system of image and interaction hum·, a species of Artificial Intelligence that has little intelligence but capable of performing a few basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a ship to move to the company campus) in response to what he was asked during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, which are - including to remember what places they occupy - and listen and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them from the discussion groups
In the presentation video, the recipient detects a third person, but it understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to it and that it is not part of the company.
She asks her if she's here to visit someone and she says she'll answer her in a few instants.
All this without blue.
Impressionant.
But, of course, this represents the future.
Now the company has other things about which, for example, on the next version of its operational system, Windows.
This week we have discussed more about a strategic change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be more and no longer have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if the computers were sold with the indispensable instead of useless applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery because Microsoft, version after version, has not ceased to keep functions and "extra" at Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, his operational system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step of Google to make Windows competition.
Many people have just highlighted that a Internet browser is not a operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary because it is the essential basis to understand the computer material and software.
He takes the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your grandmother.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but we need to see the "dead" of the operational system, not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People make less attention to the operational system but more to the Internet browser.
Only the computer is used to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and people spent more time to navigate on the Internet than to park windows.
Who are the half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can at least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain less applications, much less than View.
Less heavy, hot months, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching his own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They deeply need this, in fact, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rest rooms reserved to Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the drink distributor, one shows their request to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not go out at the beginning of 2009 but to the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to start at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more than one phone.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dear.
The Fabuloso Marcel
Paul Picasso was throwing him on the Court of Azur, 日o di Caprio, one in the 'Edward Zwick' blood Diamant, as well as Al Papaino in 'The Parrain' of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the muscle gays.
And if we start to number all of its apparatus, we could also quote this moustachu cosud that lifted weights in a walking circle.
It's not just a simple man's body maillot in coton, moving, and without missing.
It was called "tank", but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels distinguishes from all others.
All over, by his flaming name - although he is known under the name of 'Marcel' - who has to see the sport because he takes the name, the end, the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the song Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel ' distinguishes from others by its excellent cotton, by its unisex cover, by its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (as soon as possible) that the most combined body maillots have in the neck.
But attention, because the Belgian mark produces not only top tanks.
But it also produces sweat-shirt, retro boxers, caachmire cardidants, cotton bags, kids, mini-shorts...
Constructed clothing for the comfort of sub-made.
Even if it's damage to carry them only as sub-made.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry about me."
His great similarity to his sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica\z is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the sisters are seriously taking their new activities in the mode.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who make their name.
It was present to the promotion that Mango mark made in Paris to its new social seat but as well as to the presentation of the most important prices of the model than the Spanish house sponsorize.
Monica is heavy and horrible.
Ra's what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister and I and Penelope have grown for Mango for the new winter season, but also to assist the presentation of the second edition of Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of Opera in the honor of Valentino.
One very intense day, but at the same time, excitingly waiting for us.
On what is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The movie of the 50s and 60s is enraging us and we inspire it much for our collections.
I love myself in the city and watch women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dance, actor and designer, you're a very polyvalent woman: isn't it?
I think yes but at the end of all, and these activities have a lot of things in common.
Since I was all small, I loved the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother to look at the armies of my tante and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the park of attractions.
Then, when I became dancing, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers love to dress for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel well.
And in the actor's role, when you put your clothes in this moment, you're actually putting yourself in the skin of the person.
At the moment, everything's connected.
You haven't been 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years are happy.
I think the woman is more mature, more experienced, and life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did all the things I wanted to do since all the little, and that gave me a lot of happiness.
So you think you're gonna be a mother?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me and I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
I don't worry about the candidate.
What I'm going to do is giving my son a lot of happiness and educating him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movie, you're waiting for the different movies you've turned last year out.
That's true, I'm quick to get out.
I'm a woman out of the theater, I'm very impatient and anxious, I'd like to have everything now but of course it's not possible.
I'm quick to succeed the movies 'The last hour' and 'Search for Christ''.
To see what you're going to think about...
A few days ago you started on the passport with Naomi Campbell, right?
Don't say that!
I didn't get up on the passport to make the mannequin.
Just, Naomi Campbell called me, I have known her for a short time, to invite me to participate in London in a profitable shot for her for the support of women and clothing we showed - I showed two clothes of our collection created for Mango - were sold to the carriers to collect money for the NGO of Naomi.
People whom Naomi is a person in the heart.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Moreover, what is the good side of Naomi, I'm fascinated.
She asked me to roll for a so noble cause, but if she had asked me to do it, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better to women in the third world.
Alcohol recyclings to flight will have to have the 'alcohol' system
The Ministry of Interior wishes that the driver who had more than three administrative sanctions for alcoholism have a system in his vehicle that prevents the start of the vehicle in drinking, or if it doesn't survive.
The initiative has already been adopted in June last and now appears in the report of the State Minister in which this initiative is considered as a pilot project that will last a year.
His goal is the reintegration of the driver by offering it road reeducation courses.
The State Minister for Road Safety, but also the Road Safety Director General and the Technology Institution Fund for Car Safety, will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30 % and 75 % of cars arrested for more than once in drinking, the car covers.
Alcohol would avoid this because it is a system on the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the halene and prevents the start of the vehicle if the driver doesn't suffer before; or when the rate of the driver's alcohol is greater than the authorised.
Its cost is over 1000 euros and is charged by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that the vehicles equipped from this device would reduce up to 65% of the crimes during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is considered that this could save life to 115 people every year.
This measure is only due to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to cope with these behavior before they become criminal offences.
And easily implementing it, since legal reform can be made by ways, but, however, the criminal reform requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in no trade form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have a experimental basis.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on a initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party, which proposes to install this system in school buss as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 17h40, the official time scheduled, the Spanish Air Force airplane in which the Princes of Asturies traveled in the presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was watching to sleep, but its rayons were still forced to put the hand in the wheat to see the king's couple descending from the plane.
At the feet of the scale, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours ago, I asked on the street, to the taxi driver, if it was hard that the Spanish Princes visited the city to finish their official trip.
- Oh, well, once we can't go to the airport to take customers at this hour... are you from here or then...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've been thinking two years here.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican pressure knows very well who are the Princes of the Asturies and knows the importance of traveling.
They are many to wait in the airport hangar near the red cup and a military band composed of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is ridiculous and dressed of sea blue, Princess, when she has hair at the wind, is very dressed overwhelmingly and does not carry her "peep-toes" usual ; perhaps they had told her that an oral threatened.
They make a short stop at the photographs before they go to the room where the official courting waits for them.
At the door of the hotel where they sit, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a rigolo journalist of the Mexico TV attends them.
The most prestigious price of the mode
There is probably no more appropriate place in the world to present a mode price than Paris and there is certainly no more extraordinary and good living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards button to strengthen the international image of the new talents of the mode.
The winner will be restored by a price of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first edition, looked at her models in Mango's vitrine at the 54th Bulevard Haussmann in Paris, and she was almost weeping it.
Certainly, it is the second largest stock of the brand in Europe that has just been incurred with 1.335 square metres of surface.
The first bottle is located in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank Valentino, the president of the concurrence jury, have made us find in a lushing dinner at the Garnier of Paris.
As a neighbor's table of the extraordinary family Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango, appeared even more spectacular.
Having a grudge on the heart and striking against the bad heart, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati put a Mango clothes and some ELAH parks, who cut the soul, and arms on, arms below with his son Luis - a good man of almost two metres high – she accompanied Valentino to his prepared dinner in her honour.
Andik, Mango's owner, a galant man, as well as the Royal Baron ended the evening without weapons because they had prepared them to two ladies.
Monica\z, who presented himself in the store with a button and a chemise – from her own collection - and that for dinner, metamorphosed by wearing a long sexy and black dress, was embarrassed when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet repeated room and recalling the good old time, she took one of the bars and did the gesture of a "great plague".
Ines Sastre wasn't left for the visit of the palace dependencies, but she showed us before on her phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure to see Olivier Martínez – another good man who moves in a moto - and John Traة, who arrived at Paris's intercontinental hotel, with his drafts, his servings, and asked the preliminary that there were no wombs in his room.
Stars under the stars of Paris.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and the freshness of daily life.
And to coordinate everything, they are all recorded in a book that will bring relax to the books on 30 September.
We are almost attracted when he sounds every morning at 7 hours, but it's worse when we think of the aggressive rythme that imposes our current life.
The office is a synonym of pressure and the pain computer at the back.
Stress represents the harm of the 20th century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily weakness and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, no more or less than one.
Except yoga positions, classic massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in a book pages a 'menu' of methods adapted to go' and at the time of each.
The anti-stress work is named '1001 ways to delay ' and will come directly in the books of editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is impossible for peace in places such as work or through personal relations, this 'manuel' denys such faith.
Furthermore, this manual provides other methods such as contact with the nature or income of 100 % natural income that help you to delay.
If adrenaline doesn't short in your vineyards to restore the balance of your body and if the stress has become a problem, it's time to sit in the canap, disconnect from his mind, and take care of reading.
Talk Below
Some kids talk about the night.
I am not referring to those who are very wake up by telling us something happened on the previous day, but to children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens can surprise you, but actually it doesn't matter.
It's a blessed change of sleep that is called dream.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one who's talking about the night.
This phenomenon can appear very spontaneously (one time in life, for example, associated with a strong fever episode), or more pÃ©dic (all days, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything anymore.
There is no unique cause that determines its appearance
They are often linked to other changes of sleep such as cauchemars, night fears, nutrient emuries (to be pipi to bed) or sleep, but it is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong fever, stress or surexcitation situations.
In any way, it's a little studied phenomena.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a little quiet voice, with isolated words, murmurs or otherwise with crying, weeping, long talks ...
If the dream becomes very frequent, it would be just to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes many anxieties and to explain this problem.
We said that this is a blessed change, so there is no treatment, except if it is linked to another change of sleep that can be cared (for example, if it is related to a sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before you go to sleep.
So seeking quiet games and avoiding programs or television series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who are deceived to delay, relaxation techniques can be used to help them relax inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the dreams appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are inappropriate for the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful Councils
Don't wake him up.
It's inutile because he's inconscious and you'd wake it up.
Even if he talks, he's sleeping and so resting.
Remember that if he shows himself very anxious several times, it is recommended to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (what is not usual), do not try to ask him for information.
You won't get anything, because he's sleeping, he's not aware of how he can organize his mind.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what it is dreaming, and then take care of how you will interpret the information and the conclusions that you will draw.
Never tell the child that you can ask him during the night to know his secrets.
Don't even make it plasant.
This causes many anxieties.
Finally, don't worry, that's nothing bad, it's a episode that only takes a few minutes.
Reader... End
Illhaeusern finally found the way of the victory on its ground after a long time of disset.
Without making a large match, the Young and Blacks created the largest number of opportunities and succeeded to transform one for the winning of the match.
The rythm was not very supported during this meeting where the attackers were difficult to express themselves.
After a first temptation of Captain Kauffmann, who broke the lamp on a distance threshold, Illhaeusern was going to take the ace and turn to the founderflick tour remote, then with Hirn above, Roman from the end of the feet or even Diebold came to defense of Dannemaria.
In front, we made a block in the middle of the land and just left Riahi remaining at the point of the attack.
The beginning of the second mid-time would be decisive with two occasions signed by Riahi and Temporal for Dannemaria, and soon after the opening of the score for the Ilhousians by Marais, well positioned to retreat a ball on a first temptation of Diebold (53e).
But the Ilhousian butter will not be able to satisfy his happiness for a long time and will be obliged to repair the clothes a twelve minutes later and thus leave his companions in digital efficiency.
But Dannemaria won't benefit from it and will not put great problems to an Illusionian Ones who just recovered a little to "compact" his defense, but in all the last seconds of the game where, after a big café, the ball passed very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy at the meeting of wrath fishers
Before going to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a turn by Britain.
In view of the demonstration of the forces of fishermen who were strongly disturbed on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to take place Tuesday morning at the Gailvinec port in the Finisher to meet their representatives there.
The last promised to accept it "in a constructive spirit" and hope that it would "come with specific proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a General Assembly of the "Christ Committee" established by the British fishermen for measures against gasoline prices, which reached a record of more than EUR 1,14 per litre in average.
According to Elysée David Martinon's portfolio, the president will "describe with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies find competitiveness and ensure the conditions of employment and payment of the sea."
Nicolas Sarkozy was expected to be closed by fishers.
On Wednesday morning, they conducted downloaded operations in Morbihan and Calvados, providing nearly 10 km bottles.
Quiberon's gate of pleasure was also locked, but the links to the Belle Island were not stopped.
A filter bargage was running on the nearby island of Quiberon.
The mariners have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, as soon as it was, pins and palettes before the depths of Brest ports, and Lorient, while manifestations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brie.
The movement was spread to other ports of the Atlantic Fazade and Manche, such as the Sables of Olonne, Vendea, where the chalutiers remained at quai, or in Havre, where a 20 battles blocked the movements of trade ships.
The fishermen in La Turball and the Crossic, in Loire-Atlantic, stopped the block of the important raffiny total of Donges at night.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting of Friday in the Ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "Christ Committee" must actually decide on Tuesday of the following steps to be given to the movement and participation in the ministry of agricultural and fish in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the responsibility of the National Committee on Fisheries, which did not support their movement.
"The Grew will continue" because "the fishermen will not leave anything" and "no want to move to Paris", Liliane Cariou, for example, announced the President of the Committee on Fisheries in Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who are not paying taxes on gasoline, are currently paying about 50 centimeters per litre, but they believe that the rental level of a ship is reached only with a gasoline less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Great
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and Kid" died from a cancer sequence at the age of 83, in his house of Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes have welcomed the film end and the involved actor, Paul Newman, died at the age of 83.

AIG would intend to cease more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the American Monetary Authorities have blown, intends to cease more than 15% of its assets to restore the $85 billion, which has been advanced, the dominical edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities besides its international insurance and its retraite activities to the United States, indicating the journal that cites the nearly sources of the dossier.

The assets in which AIG intends to separate themselves include its International Financial Lease Corp Air Leasing filial, its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings reassurer and his immobile portfolio and its investment in private equity, FT.
No definitive decision was taken on these cessions, followed by the FT.
AIG must quickly carry out liquidities to recover the loan of 85 billion billion that the Federal Reserve has given him to see the US authorities taking 80% of their capital, dividing the current shareholders in two proportions.
Analysis Paris History of the Morning Meeting Session Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Bourse accused a historical fall on Monday after rejecting the Paulson Representatives of the Plan: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, either a loss of 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) extended 777.68 points to 1O.365,45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest fall of his story (684.81 points) was previously recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the recovery of trade after terrorist attacks of 11 September.
Nasdaq, at the dominant, was 199,61 points to 1.983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (such as 106,85 points), to 1.106,55 points, and the final closing numbers.
Wall Street has already been depressed at the start of the meeting, after the unexpected rejection of the Bank Representatives of the Bank Rescue Plan, which had to be allowed to find a little stability on the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 votes for, the representatives gave the secretary the means he asked.
Nearly two of the three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees the Congress that cannot adopt a plan," Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial, said.
"This shows how much the market was in this way," she said, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come "too late".
"If the project is actually dead... then the relais will pass quickly to the Fed (the American Central Bank, ndlr) and to other central banks to manage the crisis, which would increase the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, Economy Chef of Global Insight.
And more accentuating the feeling of emergency, Mrs. Piegza stressed that " every day the fall of a financial institution" would be made to the United States.
After Washington Mutual failure Friday, the authorities organized the racket of Wachovia's activities by its citigroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis was brushedly accelerated, leading to emergency interventions to the benefit of banks in the United Kingdom, Belux, Iceland and Germany, signed that markets face "not only a American crisis but a global crisis," the FTN Financial analyst.
The obligatory market has been strongly mounted.
The 10-year performance of the treasury was 3.632%, against 3.827% Wednesday evening, and the 30-year-old to 4.161%, against 4.357% watch.
Obama, winner at the points of the first television dual
In the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the Blanche House, another occurred to know who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, brought him.
Without surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaigns CGs announced their own victory in this television dual that would have been followed by a third of the American family.
The political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honest, was not enough "brilliant" to allow him to decrease his lowness in the five weeks of the presidential investigations.
The Gallup Institute, whose Saturday opinion investigation, provides a five-point advance in Obama (49 % against 44 % in McCain), considers that the democratic is who has cut off the game.
In the indetermined electors, who are those who count, Obama was winning for 39% of the investigations, while 25% of them granted the victory to McCain, a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm her progress on Thursday with the good performance of her colist, Joseph Biden, during the first and unique public debate with her rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to subestimate her.
She has good instincts," however, Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventh-year-old McCain had no stop of putting forward his indiscutible experience in foreign policy, while highlighting the "naivity" of his opposer on the issues that were in the heart of this first face-to-face.
"The Senator Obama doesn't understand that..." he charged several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president," he also assured.
An angle of attack married since yesterday in the republic televised publicities.
Obama highlighted that he represented the future.
Without disappointing, he showed himself concise and precise.
He made his ability to make the right decisions and to restore the picture of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not always understood, while Obama, if," returned, this week-end, a democratic spot reproaching the Republic of not taking all the impact of the crisis on the "American of the street".
"When John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you said Obama, yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered for a electoral meeting in North Caroline under a rain.
He has not even spoken the words "medium class" or "workers". The financial outcome is beneficially obama, which is considered by the Americans as the same to save the economy at the border of the precipice.
"The next week might be a decisive tournament," he estimated yesterday the democrate senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current debat is "the eight-year-old final verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that it would be possible to reduce the taxes of 95% of the Americans despite Wall Street's surprises, the Senator of I°Nois also pointed out that the implementation of a potential energy independence from the country by promoting renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a health security system.
McCain wanted to build a 45 nuclear centre park from here to 2030.
In fact, the two candidates addressed the issues on the financial safeguard plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted by the Congress last night and extremely immobile.
In Minsk, "You noticed there was a choice, you?"
Young and opponents showed on Sunday night on the main place of the Belarus capital to refuse the results of the islatives.
Some hundreds of Belaruses gathered on Sunday evening after the closure of voting offices on the central place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the islatives.
While no result has been announced yet, many young people had come to manifest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, the demission".
Some acknowledge that they have not even voted, "What is good, because they will do what they want from my voice," said a young man.
They do not believe that the scheme that has made the foreign observators a good figure in order to renew the language with the European Union is ready to perform a democratic tournament.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visa for 40 Belarus leaders and the ice of some owners, could be raised if these elections were considered own by observers.
They have not been opposition.
"We have been held in the electoral committees and our observers have not been able to participate in the depourment," Jouri Potemkine, the portfolio of the Union of Democracy Forces, deployed a hetherogenic grouping of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change, stressed Alexandre Milinkievitch, an ancient candidate for opposition to the presidential of 2006 and the leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is that counts the voices, and with us is the ex-effective power.
If members of opposition enter into Parliament, they will be appointed, not chosen.
But their introduction to Parliament may mean space at television, meetings in regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
Because if our economy, which is severely endeavored to Russia, enter into crisis, and we do not reform ourselves, we are able to become a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who followed the electoral process, does not have the validity of the audit.
It emphasizes that the numbers of participation appear too high, and that the generalisation of the vote by precipient (26 per cent of the electors in Minsk) opened the vote to all manipulations.
"You have noticed that there was a choice, you? ask the social-democracy leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in this year.
There was no one in the vote offices.
And there will be at least five members of the opposition to Parliament, those who agree the best to the power."
The silence of the night remains on October's place.
At television, President Loukachenko and members of the Electoral Central Committee welcome their success.
The interview - of the blood returned secure
Hema-Quebec collected yesterday the 10th anniversary of his foundation, and his president, Dr Francine Decary, had reason to enjoy, because Hema-Quebec became one of the most safe and effective blood providers of the world.
And in particular, he recovered the confidence of the public that had been seriously exhausted by the blood scandale contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As it is known, national blood reservations managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquisition of immunodeficiency (VIH) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Before this drama and the greenhouse of the public, the Government of Canada established in February 1994 an investigation, presided by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed at lighting the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations that such disasters would not be reproduced anymore.
While Judge Krever continued to submit his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Quebec to serve the Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started its activities, almost 38% of people still trusted in the Quebec blood system, Dre Decary reminds.
The situation was discouraging.
In efforts to improve the safety of blood and work on the ground during the years followed, we have renewed the public's confidence," she said proudly to say that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94 per cent of the Quebec population had now confidence in Hema-Quebec.
The Dre Decary, however, keeps the head that "the confidence is something extremely fragile".
After its creation, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec applied the principle of precaution.
At that time, we were assisted in Europe in a lot of cases of hum's form of foolish bovine disease, a new variance of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has been held strong since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know whether this disease could be transmitted by blood.
We were then supported on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which, when we do not know and that a serious disease can deal with it, in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitable to death, is initiated by exclusion measures.
In April 1999, the blood of people who had lived more than one month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was therefore dealt with.
Yet, a few years ago, it was shown out of doubt that this disease is translated by blood.
This episode showed us that the principle of caution that was applied had a meaning."
In 1999 there was a much more sensitive method of HIV depisting: nuclear acid tests (TAN) that allow directly in the blood of donors to detect the presence of the virus itself and not the anticorps against the virus, on which the tests were used until then.
The TAN has enabled the mute period to recover, which has occurred between the time when the person was infected and the first virus can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
It was possible to reduce this period to a period below one week.
Thus, the risk of some donors to be infected was substantially decreased and cannot be detected.
These improvements have been allowed to consider the risk of contracting AIDS by blood transfusion.
Today, a person of 12 million shortly risks to receive blood contaminated by HIV.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products should be distributed before someone is infected by HIV.
As Hema-Quebec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products each year, this will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I think that today it can be felt like receiving or prescribed blood transfusion to recover health," says Hema-Quebec's leader.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen will be in the system.
Not later than the past year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting, which, as regards the west Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It must be constantly watching," Dr. Decary continues before pointing out that in addition to a security supply, Hema-Quebec must also provide a sufficient supply.
"The needs increase because the population is old.
As the anticanceral treatment is more aggressive, patients often need reloading in red globules or placebos.
Agement of the population has also effects on the network of blood providers that group only 3% of Quebecois acceptable to the blood gift."
However, everyone in health, age of 18 and more years, can give blood every 56 days or six times per year.
In average, 14 per cent of those who offer their blood are not accepted because they are reached by AIDS or Malaria, for example, and if they have traveled into a country where the malicious causes, they will be excluded for a period of a year.
"As these 3%, we will keep a inventor that responds to hospital needs.
Penuries are very rare.
But the members of this provider network must be renewed as they are older and can't give their blood anymore.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donor.
Today's life is so disappointed, we are rarely finding the time to pass a hour to give his blood," Francine Decary disappoints.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec provides not only blood products but also human weights, including bone plugins, heart walls, eye globes and skin that are almost used for big burns.
These weights are analyzed, transformed and congeled before they are placed at Hema-Quebec who also manages the only cordon blood bank in Quebec.
The ombilical cordon that was ever considered as a biomedicic waste is a rich blood in suck cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leucemia.
"We feasted, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousands of cordon blood samples and we are planned to take more than a thousand per year.
The dra Decary, which describes this cordon blood-prefect programme as a very popular programme, should be initiated to propose for records at the beginning of the next year.
"Multium moms are disappointed that they can't access it," because Hema-Quebec does not have the ways to propose this complex and costful program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - The effect in half-final
Montreal's impact was qualified for the half-final range of the eliminatory series of the first USL division, using a victory of 3-1 (4-3 to the total goals) for the expenditure of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, at the second and decisive match of the final quarter series at the total of targets in the Stade Saputo.
Antonio Ribeiro's middle land marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half without purpose on one side like the other side, the middle of David Texto and Rocco Plan ́no marked the other plates of demonstration training.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that at the first match of the turnover series, Friday, the Impact had fallen from 2-1 to Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in Seattle.
The impact will be measured in the Whitecaps of Vancouver in half-final.
Samedi night at Minnesota, the Thunder combined a deficit of 3-1 in the return truck to get it 4-3, but the Whitecaps also accessed the half-final 5-4 round to the total targets.
The impact should face the Whitecaps Wednesday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Shortly - Kovalev's Victorious But
The trio number one of Canadians is ready to take the season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn, composed unit, encouraged the attack in a 3-2 of the Canadian winning to the Panthers of Florida last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec took two helps, and Kovalev collected a step in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only purpose of the fusillade.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another truck to feel myself at all."
"He tried too much to do this in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest placed north
The Prime Minister does not exclude to initiate elections before the end of the year
Rather than the General Council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest visited in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister for Health, Yves Bolduc (to the left), trying to be elected at the present part of the election.
"Responding the limits of our last large north border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest has presented with visual force, remaining in the large lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Lévis, yesterday.
After him, during his speech, a kind of Moulin was designed to images.
They turned in a bullet, on three large screens, spectacular clicks of hydroelectric bargage, miner exploitation, from Quebec viewed by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means such as in the electoral period.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister excluded that he would take the elections of this holiday, even if he noted that his time was very loaded.
The "North Plan" is the fourth pan of a "visition" which the Prime Minister Pre-Ministry has for Quebec, the "new economic space", which includes an understanding of the work with France, a agreement between Canada and Europe and Ontario.
Often mentioned in the recent talks of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been subject to a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, asked to explain why the North was "a joy to the great potential", but he did not give any extent, investment amounts or specific priority in future projects.
In addition to a few aventures of what could be developed more: including hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mini-sector, deeply under the growth of the countries and the reconstruction of infrastructures.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, cow, platin, gold, silver, iron, titan, and even diamond", the enumeration of Mr. Charest.
This "two times big territory like France", "it's with us, it's in Quebec.
It's not only with us, but it's in us," he insisted, as to demonstrate that he requested a national based myth.
The Quebec built greatly in his relationship with the North, he highlighted: the street to the gold in Abitibi, the cheese engineering, the Baie James.
"It's for us, it's our future," he said, after having made a theatre pause to see the large map behind him.
The North, 70 per cent of the Quebec territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always reckoned, stated the Prime Minister at the press point.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line on which there has been no hearing for a long time, and when the opportunity is present, I repeat this position in the name of the Government," he said.
On the other hand, "with climate changes, we need to review our view of the North," he said by speaking about the northwest pass, which will be opened throughout the year because of the ice source.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupation of the territory is a duty.
What about the residents of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about them and that the project would benefit them, particularly for young people.
Two elderly ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-pequist deputy in Ungava), have already started consultations with a 30 communities.
A interminist committee presided by Benoit Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has started a significant place.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be given."
The development of the North would also be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerned, ordered and respected for the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visibility" as continuing with the first ministers of Liberal Ministers who made it.
"As the liberals that have made us, we thought otherwise to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
Moreover, this was one of the recurrent themes of the end of the week, which began on Friday by a large cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's army at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions proposed to rebuild the Central Beauharnois in Adellard-Godbout Barage.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, in Lesage, who made the quiet revolution and nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made the Baie James, our party has been able to forward the future," said Jean Charest.
As a press point, he invited another reference, the conservator, the programme "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of 1957 to 1963.
By addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper Hydroelectric Bargage project, Mr. Charest highlighted that it was planned for 2012.
"This remains there between us, but I'm going to be there," he confided his soldiers, providing food applauses with them.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and, of course, in 2009, did not dismiss the possibility of launching a review of this automne, which the law allows him.
He stresses that his time is, however, fulfilled by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a summit Quebec-New York.
The General Council of the end of the week provided the liberal head a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" which have passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ claims, in particular, to the "speciability of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wishes that Quebec appoint the members of the Council of Radio Diffusion and Canadian Telecommunications and that these have a veto right on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the large lines of the North Plan have been accepted with skepticism.
The Pequist Chef, Pauline Marois, highlighted the North-du-Quebec Development Policy that the Government of Landry had been held in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal Government refused to apply it by reaching power in 2003.
If he had done it, "We would be more advanced today", Mrs. Marois commented at the side of his candidate in Jean-Talon (the vote that is happening today), France Mercure.
The ADQ said to support the adoption of a North Plan by the Government.
"But what we want is not just a spectacle," commented Leader Sebastien Proulx, replaced by Mario Dumont, who comes from vacations today.
Letters - A Deceived Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (o iron) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed the latest sea to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "honor" for Canada.
Thus let it be reproached on this woman who has led an inciting fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration to say so long on the surrounding of the Prime Minister and on Stephen Harper himself.
We are in front of a government that is the only one among all the involved countries that have not repatriated his citizen in the concentration camp in Guantánamo.
A government that doesn't take account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts he was reproached.
The only government who, despite the signature of the Geneva Convention, rejects his word and allows a child-soldate to cross in unhuman conditions.
The only one who returns to a parody of justice to evaluate the guilty of the accused.
Remember, for memory, that the International Amnistie and the Canadian Barreau Association are pleasing for Omar Khadr's repatriation in order to benefit from a proper trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes the eyes of torture: it doesn't matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exactions.
We are still not aware of this, but we are now assisting an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy" that Harper does not stop burning and that sounds so cruel in his mouth.
Here is the time when no moral is anymore: it can be misleading, tortured, arbitraryly captured a Canadian citizen’s good will of a Government leader until here (which will then be after 14 October...).
A number of electors believe that they will find salvation in a party who preserves the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has rejected the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is here, in this renouncement, and not else.
Free opinion - The orwellian speech of Barrick Gold
In its edition of 17 September, the Dever held a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, president of Canadian Miner Barrick Gold.
Following an orwellian logic, he states that the biggest world's biggest award company has intented a six million in diffamation against three authors and a small house of edition in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of prosecutions in diffamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to lead to the ruin anyone who has to support an opposite position?
Notwithstanding the outcome of the proceedings, the authors and the editor of the book Black Canada will have to expenditure significant amounts in order to prepare their defence and fight against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without the miner.
In these inequalities, the tactic is often to destroy defensors in order to impose a regulation to the friends that will deal with the opposition, rather than to fear anyone who is going to do it again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the opinion that she should have presented her view of facts.
In contrast to what is done in many countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates in Canada are normally being exchanged by ideas and not by matrake.
It was therefore sufficient to open its books, documents and to establish a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and financing of independent research teams that could have lighted the question.
But Barrick Gold ○ do not trust the opinion and reject the pentitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can at the same time ask for a "public" debate while disappointing the opinions of the same public?
In the world of the president, it is that this word only designs the lawyers who are softly paid and not the Canadians; this is a very close view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold, it's that the public supports the authors and editors of Black Canada because it rejects the brutal way of miner.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many feel as a bailon prosecution (continuing the "public debat", Barrick Gold has been putting a residence in the place of black Canada authors to stop the use of this term...).
Besides Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's follow-up is a direct attack against university research freedom and the search of truth, essential to every democratic society.
It refuses, in block, the right to quote creditable sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the same basis for intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss the subjects that move the rich businesses of this world in a country like Canada, with no repeat persecution, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do it according to the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment, in which we belong, has long been able to handle debates and disagreements and to solve conflicts.
The consequence of Barrick Gold shows that, in contrast with what she predicts, she does not want a transparent debate.
It's a loss for the university world, as for the public debate in Canada, and it's time that governments set up devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Saving Operation - Democrats and Republicians are hearing
Bush and the congress leaders, both Republican and Democratic, finally reached an agreement on the greatest economic salvation plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of 700 billion US dollars to free the financial crisis that has dropped Wall Street for months must still be entered by the two Congress rooms.
It provides, in particular, better control by the elections of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the recovery of the committed public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses entered for non-payment, as well as a right to view the salaries paid to the leaders of the sustained companies.
The American Secretary in the Treasury, Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiations table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, last night, at the end of a two-day negotiations marathon.
"We have made great progress for a understanding that will be effective on the markets," said the representative of Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"All was done in a way to open the real economy and the Americans of the current crisis in Wall Street," explained the democrat.
"This is the point: if we do not do this, the traumatism, chaos and disturbance of the Americans' daily life will be great," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned the sprint in the last hours by fear of the effect that would cause a new failure on investors' hour.
The time we had been granted was the opening of markets this morning.
The two American presidential election candidates, associated with the negotiations, have shown themselves very favorable to the hearing, however, without expressing their disappointment to be obliged to reach this end.
The Democrate Senator Barack Obama has assigned certain provisions to the audience, including the aim to allow the owners to keep their home and the loan on the leadership of the companies rescued by the State.
"When the contributors are requested to take exceptional measures due to the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American television walls.
Answered on another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, answered: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The big lines I've read show that it's something we'll all have to dig and with which we'll be able to go.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The plan of 700 billion is intended to buy the suspicious, risk-assets and inventory American financial institutions with the money of contributors.
After 14 months of a crisis incoming from a immobile bull which has led to the exhaustion of risk-risk hypothiatric credits (subprints) before extending to other forms of more exposed credits (PCAAA) and replaced on a liquidity gel and on the deficiency of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republican eluses who have made the first draft hearing last week.
It is believed that we have been out of this impasse since the democrats have accepted that some "toxic" assets of difficult companies are only assured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to enlarge the angles for everyone in the Congress, it was also established that if the Government had to have lost for five years with this programme, he could set up new taxes to help it recover.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first range of 250 billion, which will be able to be 100 billion billion billion if the Chairman decides the necessary.
The payment of 350 billion other billion should be taken by another vote of the Congress.
In exchange of its aid, Washington will receive shares in supported companies that will worth dividends in the case of benefit and that it will be able to sell when the tourment is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of delaying the procedures of entry in relation to residences attached to the immobile loans concerned by this plan, as well as the fixing limits to remuneration and departure payable to the leaders of the undertakings concerned.
The teachers of the plan would like to see him submitted to the vote of the Chamber of Representatives today and to the Thursday Senat.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet sure that their plan will have the green fire.
In fact, votes continued to rise against this project yesterday, both in the Republican and Democratian camp.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you," said to his electors, Republican Scott Garrett, member of the House Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yeah, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of benefiting from contributors."
An animator of a small group in the Congress, called "the cacus of the skeptics", the Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the things otherwise, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic teachers, including three Nobel Price, wrote us to say: Congress is asked to not press and consider the way to take carefully," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we had a new proof of the world's nature of crisis.
At the end of a emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis Group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion billion).
The intervention of the Governments of the Republic of Paris, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French BNP Paris bank had noticed that it refused to buy its competitor in full ship since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion billion) in the United States' risk immobilial loans.
Fortis works 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurance banks.
"This is not the lost money," said the Netherlands Minister of Finance, Wo ́ Bos, yesterday.
In exchange, a voting right is obtained in the bank and influence.
It's just something that sparing people and households now appreciate that time is uncertain."
At that time, on the other hand of Manche, the British Government seemed to nationalize another bank that was disappointed by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would account for the current loans at the Bradford and Bringley Bank, including over 41 billion (75.5 billion US) loans.
The Spanish Bank Santander told yesterday that it would buy the sugars and client accounts of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock that the British Government should nationalise since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty in the eyes of gold was a long time his map around, some will say his weakness.
If he was released from the narcissic mirror, the American actor's laughing?
Yeah and no.
His poeder, his poverty, and a talent that was running from source will also remove him from the power record that brings forth the true holy monsters.
But what a big backward!
Paul Newman, disappeared on Friday, at 83 years of a lung cancer in his rand of Connecticut, remains one of the last American cinema icons of the late years.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he looked like and who was a kind of rival to the ́ran for a long time, more implied in his game, certainly more fragile, but also the apostle of the freedom and the attitude of dramatic conventions.
Meat blood often makes wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 from a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
These European rains will be one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without ego dismissed, last quality mark.
Because it was designed by a whole country of self-factored man, the fighter of the ́fifical war, wounded in the fight, who at the beginning of the 50s studied the dramatic art in Yale and frequented the Actor's's'o of New York, before triomphing the theater, television, soon in the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the car pilot who classified the second at the 24th hour of the Mans in 1979, doubled by a sexual symbol, even though a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actor Joanne Woodward.
The shadow areas of this secret, discrete, engaged, allergic to the show-business squares, which will not actually be aware of the unity.
A honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has resulted in the witch to the films this weekend, while his great roles are addressed on the black memories.
More than a half centuries of a seventh American artist in perpetual mutation disappears through him.
The young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Chatte on a burning tooth adapted to Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Nearer than us (1990), his sensible Mr. Brie, who was in his old age, was called by a marriage that did not fulfil all his promises.
Many other Paul Newman have passed in the history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, declining, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by hate), of Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, repeated after his death, which actually launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathic malfraud in the antisym The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A billion player and winner in the magnificent The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), he will repeat his personality on the return to the Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which was worth him in 1987 his only Oscar on nine nominations.
That face throughout the age was he.
He's back.
The times are running through his parkings.
Young people know him especially through the Slap Shot culture of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, a trainer of a hokey team on a little orthodox ice.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen.
With a latest parishing role of Irish mafia in the Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the bullet was buckled.
In contrast with a number of films who laid the office quite soon, Newman will stay a long time in the seal, while declaring Hollywood, his ears, his feet and his concessions.
The French cinemaist Bertrand Tavernier viewed him, not without humor, "as a challenge to "the underplaying" judged his highly supported performances.
Profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles fell for a long time all cooked in the cup.
However, he played less often the young first than the margins: nevrose, alcoholic, salad or desperate, whose perfect traits reflect the destructions and rebellion.
As a realizer, Newman revealed misknown faces of his real pudic importance.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (see the Roman of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, traced an end to a female of melancolia.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, powerful and triste work.
Among the rain of hostels that led on Newman yesterday, his big friend and old companion of Arms Robert Redford (they had played in Others in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, "There has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant trades of the disappeared actor.
Thereafter, his career is also a large military for civil rights, Ethiopians, independent films, a contestatory for Hollywood destructions.
We will have seen a lot of his bottle trone on vinegaret, sauce, biscuits and other foods, judgeing the procedure of bad assessing go ́, though gag in the past.
However, the benefits of these ventures were paid to its Fund for childhood in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left to his five girls a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredible of his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the park of an American artist so luminous and generous.
Citoyen model, in sum and up.
What will well make Zuslag & amp; Company in their business for factures?
Proceeding on 8 October, audiences on the current criminal procedure will begin against Janos Zuschlag and its companions.
The politicians and its companions are accused of discouragement, as a permanent and regular organization, with particularly important damage, and other accusations leaders have been kept against them, such as false and false use.
According to the park, the money from subventions was costed for personal purposes, while the performance was justified by false factures.
The money of the State and the municipalities, about 65 million HUF at all, went on one side in the Fiatal Baloldal movement boxes and on the other hand, in the pool of certain people.
Their method, also made by the authorities charged by the investigation, was to touch the money of the subventions obtained by issueing cost factures, behind which no real performance had been provided, and thus the debt had never respected their commitments.
According to the accusation act, most of the factures were false.
For these last, they were looking for factures in the market of Josefváros, while they produced secrets in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies on the factures, it was decided, inter alia, during tournaments in the North Lake Balaton province, performed by István Lados, on request of Janos Zuschlag.
According to the deposition of the last, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he requested a fax on the model of which they made the other facts that they would, inter alia, introduce to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Work, and the Municipality of the Capital to access subventions.
The majority of the factures were created by István Lados and by his companion András ↓ri, who implied our information, especially to edit the documents necessary for obtaining subventions.
When a "reperation circle", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two factors issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, this site ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of Biztos Pont Egyesuelet.
However, it would have been impossible to do so many people at the same time.
Similarly, in the year 2002, the facture established in the name of the Jobb Jövért Foundation, which then will bring the name of Együtt a Harmadik Evrédert, grew out of forms and background errors.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people to pass the night. However, the factory mentioned a hundred thirty clients.
Factors for the deteriorating imagination have also fallen in excess when they mentioned the Pigal Kft company, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accountability, the name of Jobb Jövért, and the name of Hoppá did not appear, the information given to the park.
Gy\t Farkas, the manager of the company, said at the site hvg.hu that when the parquet called it and showed him the factures, he immediately knew that it was fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache."
He said: "Apart from the form, the fact that, according to the fact, hundred people lived there, wasn't also, because this establishment only counts 11 rooms, which have not so much place.
Moreover, the factory also mentioned food, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The elected factory issuers have also not known themselves on Budapest’s travel agencies, which are part of their choice, but are only travelling to the foreign. Thus, naively, they have indicated residents in Hungary on the factures to be resolved in species, which also go against the Agency’s accounting practices.
In addition, as it appeared in the investigation, they also acquired the VAT on these documents, while the provisions on travel activities, which the destination is outside the European Union, are calculated without TVA.
Similarly, the TVA rate of the four factors established in the name of the Hotel Revülöp in the order of Jobb Jövért was wrong, since the company's performance does not support a 25% TVA as specified, but a 15% TVA. In addition, the employees of the hotel are only printed, while the fake were edited in the hand.
The parquet investigation shows that the "emittors" also made errors in mentioning the transport of goods on the road, that the emissions company could not exercise factures, since its profile was the investment advice.
Moreover, it is also for vices of forms, such as inadequate factures and false secrets, that the factures issued by the order of Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapitvány, from XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesuelet and Biztos Pont were false.
Like in the case of Ravenna Bt. or of the Kunfehertó sport stage, which both refuse to be the authors of the factures issued in their name.
The faussers did not even take attention to the fact that the HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the Fiatal Városert Egyesuelet group had to take food with them. According to our information, the liquidator of the company had not issued this fact.
Factures established deliberately
Another category of factory issuers is the composite of those who were really conscious that they were asked to issue ficticial factures.
The Esély Budapestert Alapitvány foundation, on request of Fiatal Baloldal Grouping -ifjú Szocialisták, has established a factory in order for the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Evredert for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the accusation act, the manager of the Collab Kft. was brought to false factures by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, he cooperated with the Zuschlags, the Biogate Kft, which is currently under liquidation and who has issued factures in 2003 by the Jobb Jövért Alapitvány Foundation order, the Atlasz Egyesület and the Vorösfeny _ Egyesület, for an amount of about five million HUF, but behind which no performance was actually provided.
There was no financial movement, notwithstanding that the emission of factures had been cancelled later, but that agencies were well prevented from mentioning it in their accountability.
The following category of facturing companies is the company directly linked to accused companies.
Thus, the Administrative Delegate of the Director-General of Delta Trió Kft, cared for fuel trade and vehicles, whose social seat was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, this company issued several factures on the sale of computer equipment for approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The director of this company was a Roman man, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have made documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he had issued factures to the order of the Atlash, Hoppa and Egyptian companies in Harmadik Evredert Alapitvány, and that he emphasized their contra-value.
It is precisely at Iván Kubatov's request that Roman macements created Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, which the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work.
However, he used these companies, since on the request of Master Zsolt Sente, co-accused as well as the editor of the funding acts of the companies, has established factures for their names, in order to relate to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Genaration.
Kubatov gave agencies, 15 factures totally issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Los Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The parquet thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the factures and the VAT were going to Kubatov.
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fiction factors used in the application of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generation and Šövetség in Modern Magyaroršágért introduced a request for subvention to the use of the socialist party, Ta ́sics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They received this subsidy for two times 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the objectives set out in the application.
In order to avoid that, five factures received from the Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Furthermore, these factures have been found during the perquisition carried out in the Office of Arrd Kemecsei, the Ministry of Education.
In the audience, a part of the accused ones will report the method of manufacturing of factures, as it had already done before the park.
What might really be interesting is that the main accusation, Janos Zuschlag himself, decides to raise the voile over all history.
Until now, his neighbors are not very detailed, and even though he has promised several times to tell the few details, he has not yet done it.
The question is to know whether it is in its interest, or then, possibly, the socialists would have concluded an agreement, which, in exchange of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would only carry the head.
Today, this latter is probably invoked, since the requests for its residential position in monitoring, based on a claim of its detention conditions, continue to fall in the ear of a sure.
Penso that those who have caused much more important damage, and the authors of unreparable economic crimes, are freely or at least waiting for the end of the procedure at their own home. He does not have this opportunity.
The psychology of the survey: why are more money spent?
During the winning of businesses, purchasers have tendence to spending more, and to overestimate goods.
Neurological and economic researchers at the University of New York have succeeded to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study in the Science magazine, human beings do not want to be distant in this type of competition, for example a sale to eBay businesses, and so they even prefer to pay too high price.
These research tried to set a neurological scheme of this kind of "play" with the means of winning for experimental businesses.
One of volunteers played the lotto, while the other group participated in a sale to logic businesses, while using a functional magnetic resonance procedure (IRMf), researchers analysed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In the two games, the participants could win money, but during the sale of the businessers whose principal element is the surrounding of one third, the enemy found under the cerebral troop, called striatum, was intensively moved at the loss of the party.
This part of the brain, near several other functions, plays a role in the "auto-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, prices are explained with the escape from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, economic members of this group of researchers have continued financial monitoring analysis.
In these cases, three groups were surprised against a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the group of controls of the real value of the product concerned, and thus did they.
In another group, they promised that if they were also winning the part, they would receive 15 additional dollars in reverse.
While the third group received him these 15 dollars before the undertakings, the members of the group also lost that money, where they lost the undertakings.
The difference between these two groups is actually that the accent was placed at one on the victory, while at the other on the failure.
Thus, by demonstrating the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team of players "confronting the failure" were available to higher positions than those carried out by the control group and the "for the victory".
"The results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them did not explain the phenomenon found in the winning of the undertakings only by the pleasure of winning and stoping the risk.
Only the neurological image methods have helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories, now, on a third explanation." - found Andrew Schotter, professor of the faculty of economic sciences at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
In the world, about half billion people suffer from hepatitis B or C chronic, while in Hungary the chronic blood disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated to 100 miles the hepatitis hepatitis portors in Hungary, but only seven miles follow a treatment. This is because the diseases often don't know that they are virus portors.
Hepatitis name is a generic name given to lever infections and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Heavy inflammation and yellow are characteristics, but pathogenic agents and diseases are different.
Hepatitis viruses, pathogen genes, are mainly distributed in two forms: Hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood-virus and organic liquids (sperm, vaginal secretion, salive).
For travelers, it is recommended to vaccinate against virus A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, generally associated with bad general state, weakness, stomach and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and the white eye a yellow, the salts become more deep and the urine takes a more flat colour. The cure can take two to three weeks.
Throughout the world, each year, a million people die from the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or blood cirhosis of hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one of the ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to a cirhosis or a liver cancer.
The majority of the sick people do not know the virus, because the pathogeneous gene destructions the liver cells in a way. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, a previous prevention is very important, as well as regular depisting tests.
contamination is much higher than the average among a three-group population: people with blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tattoos.
Currently, 200 million patients with a chronic C hepatitis in the world are numbered.
Since the disease can be detected by a laboratory routine examination, it is recommended to consult your doctor treating from the observation of unknown symptoms of origin.
The disease can be healed if it is detected at time. The virus can be eradicated from the disease, thus the risk of confusion disappears and cancer development is prevented.
On 30 September, hepatitis is the world day, organized for the first time in 2004 by the agencies representing sicknesses from the four corners of the world.
His goal is to draw attention to chronic blood cirhosis, caused by virus, the causes of its development and the importance of the previous disease.
Does he who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious faith would work as a kind of analgetic, which would have already contributed to enhance the death of Catholic martyrs.
The British Telegraph dated a article that the researchers at the University of Oxford performed an interesting experience by analyzing at what level faith in God could affect the tolerance of human being pain.
In the context of this experience for at least strange, 12 Catholic believers and so many atees were subjected to electrochocs, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virge Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of souffrance.
Thanks to a human brain palpation technology, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the pain regulation.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, in which the academics, scientists, philosophers and theologists participate from different sectors of the university.
More precisely, the experience is developed in the following way: a instrument that emits ethnic and spreads the electrochocs is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
Researchers asked the participants of the experience to view two paintings in a supported way, one of the Virge Marie painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady at the Hermin painted by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers from the origin of this experience would hope that the view of the Virge Marie refers to a kind of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, was on its calm effect.
Experimental subjects spent a half hour in a IRM scanner, and during that time, 20 electrochocs in four parts succeeded.
The Catholics said that in view of the Virge Mary, they felt as "in secure" as someone who "keep care" and "will be calm, and peace envahied them".
In view of the creation of religious thematics, they realized 12% of pain less than when they looked at the work of Leonard.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the experience, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in the atei, in the condition of finding the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, an English episode, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, actually change our personality," Wright said.
Following these excellent results, is there no longer the question of knowing what would be the effect of regulating the pain of the subjects if it was shown to the believers a Madone painted by Leonard or a painting of the same calibre?
Would the view of a Vierge Marie of better quality cause better results?
You're what you're talking about.
At the time of his tenth birthday, Google states that it can be found at the bottom of the pocket of people in the same title as the sky above their head. He knows where they have passed their vacations, what specialists they consult and what are their interest centres.
However, it is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the major people of the society.
As regards the skeptics establishing a parallel with Orwell's horrible vision, these do not just see the essential site 2.0.
Eric Schmidt said, for a while, to the Financial Times, that the main ambition of Google is to raise more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can comply with their original goal that sounds like: "Let us gather all information in a system!"
According to Google's leader, after ten years of a world chamber work, they are always only at the beginning of their goals to be able to handle all information.
The question is: what will be in five years? Schmidt answered that he would like that Google could answer questions such as "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the work that would eat me best?". However, the software will not be able to answer this kind of question, simply in the first view, that the day they will know enough about users.
It is not perfect for all internautes that the words used during Internet research, the IP address of the computer launching the search and the pages consulted later by interested people are exactly recorded.
By means of the Customized Search Programme, two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and consult what they have searched on. Thanks to this, long-term, recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personal answers and will provide us products and services based on our statements and stored preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my job is? They ask users who are concerned about seeing Google information monopole.
In most cases, this is the potential power represented by the company that can rise from fear, and this is not the remission, fear of punishment, desire of freedom or possibly the revolt against the power that can lead to an antireaction among the internates.
However, it is confirmed that the search terms are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are transferred to a third, and in this kind of case nothing protects the personal rights of the internat.
The most fascinating example of these recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedoes, while Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information he had collected on the page named Orkut, so that it can be identified.
Anxieties of the rights of the person have been able to move a supper of relief in May, when Google, arms below with the EFF EFF legal protection, has proved his right to the Court in front of the FBI. According to the judgment that in the future, Google will not always be able to be binding by any of the points of the constitution to distribute information on the secret request of the FBI, in any way.
(Amount, the Federal Government has successfully received approximately 50,000 web addresses and 1.000 research terms that he had received in relation to the strengthening of the child protection law, voted several years ago, but at the end, he has not been able to find lists of private users' research, nor the entire list of web sites and key words in the last two months.)
Thus, the judgement of Google is pretty contradictory: it is confused by those fearing the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intime and their private area suffers when they start using Google services. Thus, they attack themselves in the spirit of rebellion that we manifest against the proud multinational companies of their conservative image.
During this time, the American geek culture and its "savements" gathering passionates, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of the large enterprises, the "corporation" by opposition to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, even if both are in the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, contrary to Microsoft, does not ask his users for identifier code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the software package, constantly refreshing, has a much more accessible, younger and cool effect, against the practice of the official software geant.
The reason may also be that geexs see very precisely the problem relationship between person's rights and the Internet, and what the most proclaimed keyword in these last years is just behind it.
In fact, Web 2.0 does not matter anything other than the employment, but the fact that we are intentionally left tracks behind us, and that we use communications channels that are available to us, and while the dimensions of these are changed one by one, the key remains the same: we are exposed.
A young, generally, can have a profile on several pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and it can even connect these to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, reading its musical habits. Then it can connect them to a prosecution system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which their most recent photo gallerys appear automatically on Flickr or on Picasa.
Think that we can learn many examples, such as the girlfriend who easily understands the pictures of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his guilty friend has passed the evening, or the company who has licensed one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions that he has written on his blog on the top management, we can be on one thing: the private term is to consider from our day.
He who lives a online life consists of what he shows from himself, and so the principle can be defined behind the behavior of today's young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least, to try to turn the Google monopol, can do it (e.g. by starting with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time without intentionally leave any track).
The number of people who, deliberately, are not recorded on pages so that it is not possible to find them is not less. The Google online services, using text processing to the image processing, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not associated with large server parks and who do not have our best profile, since there is yet.
The opinion expects, without really hide it, the time when Google will devote his real nature.
The company, with its current value of 156 billion dollars, values more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the number of advertising agencies' business, while the performance introduced at a far more important speed provides seriously not only to Microsoft, but to many other computer program creators.
However, critical observers find, in addition to this, contradictions with anxiety effects: for example, the top management of the company has, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after doubled the price of the business mother and after the company has considered too honestly the multi-day restoration at any time. All this is deteriorated by the fact that in 2006, Google has bought before the Chinese government and under the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good go's, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of society, the new services are only announced when they can be used. It is sure that in the next months and next years, they will move the world on new points. Some think that the project of scan and archive of books and magazines of Google takes so important dimensions that the company is so important to find the Supreme Court of the United States, others tremble before his health system, because in this, we can build full medical benefits from our previous analysis, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google gets a genetic database can give a good primary material to the next generation of scientist-fiction authors. The Roman of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half-tons of orwellians, describes the future in which a man could be approximated only through Google data.
Two minors helped to avoid the tracks of the dual killer of Ozd
"The police invited two minors to question them in the case of the double murderer of Ozd. According to suspicion, they helped to avoid crime tracks." - said the portfolio of the commissioner's department of Borsod.
Youths have recognized the facts that are reproached to them, and in the meantime they are accused of complication.
The two minors, which, according to MTI (Hungria Telegraph Agency), are young girls, are free.
The complication of murder can lead to a detention that can go up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double killer of Ozd, a 23-year-old young man, was placed in temporary detention on Sunday.
The accusation heads held against him are multiple murderers, committed with premeditatation and interest.
Inquiry, it appeared that the 23-year-old young man had a large amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspicious didn't want to fix his debt and therefore he attached his creditor, last Wednesday, to an Ozd site where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this man, who was nine years old.
According to MTI's information, the young man predicted his crime. The army with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes on the crimes places is evidence.
The police examines the arms and circumstances of its use with specialists.
Varsovia's bourgeois makes a proposal for the raising of the bourgeois of Prague
Warsovie's values offered two hundred million euros, approximately five billion Czech crowns, for the 100% rating of Prague's values.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of Varsovia's Values, confirmed that the Polandians have made this proposal despite that the Czechs have excluded Varsovia's circle of the new potential owners of Prague's bourgeois.
The cause of this exclusion is that Varsovia's burst is in the hands of the State.
99% of the actions are in the hands of the Polish State who wants to separate over 60% of its actions in a few months of activities.
According to the Czech economic day E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has been made up to this time for the race of Prague.
According to the Czech press, Vienna's bourgeois, Nasdaq's transatlantic bourgeois, New York's Stock Exchange, London's bourgeois and Germany's Börse's offers until this day.
Peter Koblic, the director of Prague's bourgeois, said last week that the bourgeois of Varsovie would be the least good owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could result from the disappearance of the bourgeois of Prague in the future.
The value of the bourgeois of Prague is estimated between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by the market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between actors, about 90% of the papers would be sold.
The most important owner of Prague is the Patria Finance Investment Bank, with approximately 25 percent of participations, followed by 14,7 per cent of the Ceská Sporitelna bank and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13,5 per cent.
The financial crisis of the European press viewpoint
In their comments on Tuesday to the international financial crisis, the European press leaders are already called "second, 11 September".
"The global financial catastrophe, it is to be given to the President of the United States," accuses Rome's day, the Republic. "The President had not even been able to block with his own part behind a proposal of law, impurified to the va-vite, in order to bring help to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as warren Buffett billion, is more appropriate to talk about a second on September 11.
A part of the madrilene press also sees the emissionary box in Washington.
According to the view of the El Mundo daily, these are the lack of the political direction there-based leading the world economy to the border of the flood.
The risk of the deployment of the US financial system increases every day, and then the whole world will pay the strong price.
Bush's plan was far away from being perfect, however, according to the congress vote, a real threat, which Washington does not propose political tools to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the empty, just at the time in the capitalism history, one of the largest transformations is going on.
The threat can't be ignored longer - highlights Geneva's Days-Indexer.
Some states may still have a job of salvation to their tittant financial agencies, and by the money of their contributors, they can save them from the failure.
Of course, if there are more banks as such as domains, no financial means or new improvisations will be sufficient.
At the long term, we need the states of the European Union to make a little case of their national egoism and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
Nothing on Monday, the weak financial agencies received more than 100 billion euros - reminded the Vienna Day, Der Standard, that fears of which the European contributors will also have to put their hands on the pool, very deeply similar to the Americans in order to cure the crisis, become more real.
To this end, the EU has not really been occupied with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is partly through the old continent.
The "saverers" should not immediately burn 100 billion euros, but it would be just if they noted the case it would be reasonable to touch the money of contributors, with the aim of preventing greater deficiencies.
The smart car imitates the bourdon flights
What method would be better to develop ability to avoid obstacles if this is not the imitation of a already existing obstacle detector?
Like, for example, the one of the cows.
In the amazing project presented in the CEATEC, which occurred in Japan, the bourdonnative birds gave the strategy of department of Nissan engineers to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In relation to the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini-Robot car, a bio-inspired auto-roboted system of BR23C, which has equipped the quality of the coppers, the final goal is to encourage the establishment of a system that can avoid all obstacles.
During its flights, each abeil constitutes its own space, oval form, which actually is much in our safe protective cock - explained, during the exposure, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the Department of Research and Development and Marking Relations.
The eye on the faces of the cow plays a primary role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
In order to imitate the functions of faces, the engineers have reached the idea of the telemeter to laser.
This identifies obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and a distance of 2 meters before the BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the board micro-screen, which transforms it into a immediate avoidance manner.
The perception of the obstacle occurs in a fraction of second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the mouths of the abeil, immediately change the direction of its wheels by turning it to a quick angle to avoid the evasion.
In contrast to any existing system, this operation of avoidance is fully instinctive.
"If it wasn't like this, the mini auto robot could not respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotized car project.
It must respond instinctively and instinctively, since this corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal bed of the protection coverage, a box in which for instantly the employment is considered inevitable.
All of this process must reflect what the beef does to avoid the other cows.
The process must take place in an eye clip.
In contrast to the cows, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonal, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction where the wheels can turn.
Instead of infinity combinations that have the beefs to avoid other bees, in our case, only rotative movement, acceleration and relance as manworks of the mini auto robots were used.
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer bacteria which are more powerful and whose energy is greater, which makes their life duration longer than in Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the intellectual intellectual reaction that is primarily, not the processing of data, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should only treat a few signs per second, and react to these.
It is not necessary to store them and react with the intuitive logic based on data of previous workers. In this way, it uses only a few dozens of kilo-bytes of memory continuous.
We do not need memory of giga-bytes capacity, nor even mega-bytes.
This is the first step to the design of an instaurable avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will make its input into the cars produced in series in the next ten years.
Another application may be its integration in the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on its road.
We even gave a name to the baby out of price
The written version of the economy salvation plan of $700 billion, aiming at buying the twisted bank credits and using several times, is ready.
In the first turn, half of this sum will be spent.
Re·s announced that during new debates extending up to midnight, Saturday, local hour of the coast, the leaders of the Congrès agreed on existing conflicts since days and days, around a total amount of $700 billion.
"We have done a serious step before," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Chamber of the Representatives, and it is only to put the agreements on paper.
The commitment, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The American Secretary in Trezor, Henry Paulson, stated the results of the commitment that the programme will work and will be effective, however, other measures must still be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not questioned, here, of the salvation of Wall Street, but to turn the economy roads in other ways.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, Sunday at 20 a.m., local hour in Washington (that is Monday at 2 a.m., the local time of Central Europe), but did not cause spectacular montage in the bourses.
Monday, the Room of the Representatives will be the first to vote on the proposal of a law in accordance with the name of the Law of emergency economic stability in 2008, and then its outcome will be within the hands of the Senat.
Samedi night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with progress reached tonight, and we appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the White House's password.
Furthermore, the programme distinguishes the initial proposal made by Bush, which mentioned that the 700 billion dollars were spent once once for the recovery of funds on suspected credits.
The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by the Congrès, probably Monday, and this first amount will serve the Secretary of the Treasury to buy duty credits from the banks, while the use of 100 billion additional dollars will be left to the President's discretion.
The programme will be monitored by an independent agency in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The cost of the second half of 700 billion depends on a new decree of the Congress.
In accordance with the law, the secretariat of the Treasury will be able to establish a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to buy doubtful credits, titles on hypotheques and doubtful hypotheques, as well as other types of "toxic credits".
The competent persons of the Ministry said that the rental could be made in the framework of a sale to the undertakers, but also directly.
The rule provides the opportunity for the companies concerned to participate in a programme of insurance, where the secretariat to the Treasur guarantees the tools of concerns, for which companies will have paid a premium equivalent to pre-dama.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools in order to dedicate $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, that it is a wide range of doubtful credits, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system that leads to the deterioration of one or the other important financial institution.
"We will take the necessary provisions to be ready to apply the law as soon as it is signed" he said.
However, the bank leaders who are in bad postures and waiting for State aid can wait for their outcome recompenses, called just gold parachute outside Atlantic, will be plafoned by the Government.
The planning of the salaries is mentioned only in specific cases, and the limitations are also in the way the secretariat offers his aid to the company.
The principle of the planning means that if the secretariat to the Treasury is purchased in the framework of a sale to the undertakers, they will provide a excess of tax on the golden parachute, unless the President of the discreet bank is part of the travel.
The Government will intervene aggressively after the recovery of doubtful credits to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exceeding.
In order to complete the image, even though it is necessary that existing darkened parachutes are not reliable. Plafoning applies only to new contracts, this is so to motivate the participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that planning on the nominations of the general directors will be in force - the President of the Committee on Financial Services, Democrate Barney Frank.
In addition, the State has the right to acquisition of parts in the banks participating in the plan and thus reduces the risk of contributors, since they can even win in the case when the economy and the saved banks will return to their patterns.
The draft law states that in the next five years, the Chairman must introduce a proposal to the Congrès on how losses will be returned to contributors from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts in relation to this plan.
This is not why the American citizens have mandated us, this does not protect the dollars of contributors - said the Republican Member of California, Darrell Issa.
His democratic democracy of Ohio, Mary Kaptur think that these are the same ones who press the measures, as those responsible for Wall Street's exhaustion.

Barack Obama and McCain support both the bank salvation plan
Saturday, Barack Obama, as well as John McCain, candidates to the presidency of the two large American parties, assured their support for the government's salvation plan of 700 billion dollars. However, there are politicians who require the demission of the American Secretary to the Treasur.
After marathon negotiations that last days and days, the representatives of the Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday, that they had concluded principle agreements on the plan of banks.
This financing plan, aimed at the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain are even present, each more approximately than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the recent investigations, with the advancement of economic issues, Obama has succeeded again to make a little progress. McCain's progress, obtained by Sarah Palin's nomination as a colister just after the Republic Convention.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit, Sunday, Obama expressed its hope of seeing the Congress quickly voting on 700 billion saving law.
He stressed that the proposal contains the patterns of consumer protection which he also supports.
"Now it is necessary to act with responsibility... a danger threatens your work, your economy, all industrial sectors and the stability of all the economy," he said before a crowd of 35,000 people.
He was not missing to qualify McCain's economic ideas of overall.

Nancy Pelosi, president of the Chamber of Representatives, stated on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the Chamber votes on the proposal of law on Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right camp is intact, only in the heart of the party, the electors have become more conscious - so the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the brochure of the German Left Information Magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of CSU's dramatic disappearance in its article "The Revolution in Bavière feeds his fathers".
According to this acknowledged polytolog, the CSU's erosion started well before the complaint of Beckstein-Huber takes its functions.
Christian socialists have transformed the Bavier for decades and now are the same modern citizens who turn their backs.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all the Christian democracy, and this is also the problem of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not actually a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that had been completed just ten years ago: the indiscutable hegemonie of the national party has ended.
This was 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was gathered by 47.7 per cent, and for the first time since the fifty years, with a score below the level of 50 per cent.
This repeated three years ago at the elections of the Bundestag of 2005, namely at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause may be emphasized by modernizing "the devoring of his parents" in the region in a consistent way by the CSU.
This is 40 years ago that sociologists have announced this but have been strongly deceived about the rythm, but secularization, the results of the education and the establishment of northern and east Germans in the region of Bavière, in full development, could not remain unconsequently on the loyalty of CSU electors.
Modernization will be aligned with opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also .
The right camp is intake, but inside the party the electors have become more conscious, more critical and more entitled.
It is also surprising that during these last weeks, it is just the classic citizen groups who have been rather remote from the CSU, such as independents, artists, holders and diplomats of higher studies.
In these groups, CSU support was decreased by 40 per cent.
The press (depresse.com)
In his article titled "Who? With who? The presidents of the Party are on the reservation to coalition issues," the Austrian conservator cares about the situation of the confusionary internal policy that has been installed after the Austrian elections.
Austrian socialists of the SPÖ want to discuss with the UVP conservators.
The OECD prohibited the SPÖ to meet its internal business.
The BZÖ popular party is open for negotiations. The Green people do not want to agree on coalition yet.
The elections have occurred, now all around the coalition; in television-organized debates, party leaders almost leave their cards.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the OVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that both parties are actually possible - that is what already exists in certain regions and in socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as an annuler, remains open from Faymann.
As he mentioned, the direction of Schüssel-Molterer was, in any case, rejected.
A replication of this combination is out of question.
Molter reacted with attentiveness to the proposals of red.
As he already said, a employment will certainly be unfruitful if Faymann tries to meet the OVP's internal matters.
In its part, the choice of opposition or entry into coalition is at the moment a very open question, which must absolutely be discussed within the OVP.
Jörg Haider, president of BZÖ, is re-opened to all proposals.
"To avoid coalition of red and black, we are ready to carry out government responsibilities," said Haider.
Yaróka said: The vital circle of poverty and segregation must be breaked
Today, the European summit for the Equality of Chances, whose host is France, began in Paris as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In its message expressed before the plenary assembly, as one of the main words of the expert consultation, Livia Jaróka, European Commissioner Fidesz People's Party, has drawn attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of the right that affects the most Roman children and that, one of the main freedoms to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Work and Social Affairs, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner loaded of work, social and equal opportunities.
Among the people invited to participate in consultation, European social partners and the most eminent representatives of legal protection and European civil agencies are found in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Group of Fidesz Popular Party, Jaróka warned that, near the distinctions found in the ambassadors, the romes disappear from the work market, first after their low qualification.
"A widespread majority of youth roms have no secondary diplomas, and due to a elementary education of bad quality, only one infime part has the possibility of → a higher study diploma."
In addition, Jaróka insisted on the fact that education as a fundamental right to human being plays a key role when other rights are to be valided.
Investment in the previous education of Roma children is a strengthening of the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the European Parliament, this report is needed to be made conscious in a most widely possible circle, including between roms and non-romes.
In fact, soon a Roman child begins the oil, more he increases his chances to become a productive member of the work market; by taxes payed from its income and consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"From their nationality of the European Union, the romes must be assured of their right to quality education and to be protected from low-quality and sectary education." Livia Jaróka stressed.
According to the Member State, a European Union's initiative towards an objective and an action is necessary for immediate acceleration of the school desegregation process, which is primarily important for compliance with existing antidiscrimination and preparation directives.
"We must break the vital circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and we must give the opportunities of democracy to the Roma children to be able to participate as citizens of full right in the future of Europe," Jaróka requested.
On behalf of the European Year for the Chance Equality for all, the aim of the Supreme Top for Equal Chances in Europe organized each year since the top of Berlin last year is to ensure a single platform to support the measures taken for the equal opportunity and the fight against discrimination at European level and at the level of Member States.
CSU: Grace for a transition period
It is in October that the decision will be taken on the sort of Huber-Beckstein Due Dechu
Despite this choiceful failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the top of the Bavarian CSU has been updated.
The President of the Party, Erwin Hube and the leader of the Regional Government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place. The question is to know how long the grace will take place?
At the same time, with a catastrophic vote loss of 17 per cent, the exceptional party's congress will be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this very criticized couple, in any case, have felt that they were not especially at their seat.
With this, they employed the furious members of the fraction and base, which once after the "sunami bavarois" required personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
It was five years ago - it is true, yet under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union was 60.7%, while today, one year after the puzzle against Stoiber, it remained only 43.4% of their force.
The CSU was the only sovereign one of the Bavery who gave 18 percent of the German PIB.
However, the conservators are still strong in this south region, which is a key importance for Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal rehabilitation of the party, the President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, who had been presented as the possible follower of Huber, also received a place in this modesty group of employment, which initiated discussions with the Free Electors, for a possible coalition of the Government of Munich.
A strange nest of the destination was that through the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli's legislation, whose measurement against Stroiber served as the possibility of putsch perpetuated by Duo Huber-Beckstein, then to deal with the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, the CSU leaders put all their energy to stabilize, in a way or in another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who was currently driving the staff in the coulisses, will also receive an active role. The former leader of the Regional Government and former President of the CSU appointed on 28 September as the most amazing day of its political career.
On Monday, Huber started a few notes to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the deficit as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following Bundestag's elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will be able to be more chanceless than if they are going on a way or otherwise, with a common force, the CSU, who has played an important role in the 2005 national success.
According to Merkel, hiding hardly his deception caused by the fiasco, the CSU's land loss will not affect the big Berlin coalition.
However, what is related is because it will not be easier to manage the vulnerable CSU, and the crisis of the socio-democracy always endures.
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with 18,6% in Bavière.
Lukasenko - its dictionarys: 110 - 0
No members of opposition had access to the Belarus Parliament after the elections of Sunday.
According to Russian observators, this is explained by a country managed by Alexandre Lukashenko, which provides it for prosperity and stability, while, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is explained by illegalities committed during the release of votes.
The OSCE, sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the islative 110 in this country of 10 million residents has been very opposition for long decades before the elections of yesterday, the opposition to join its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) would expect seriously that Lukehenko, renewing its Chairman mandate for the fourth time during doubtful elections on the change in the constitution in 2006, would "to allow" this time the presence of some members of the opposition to Parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ revoked its booklet for origin.
The fact that Belarus, economically more depending on Russia, would want to improve its reports with the EU, where, due to the qualified Belarus policy order of antidemokratic antidetermination, Lukashenko and several highly placed politicians did not receive input visa, was one of the expectations of opposition.
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on deficiencies, such as the prohibition of presenting for a third of the candidates to opposition, refers to a pre-paused pausement.
However, Monday OSCE had already contested the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and especially the fact that the opposition could not be present during the delay of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition feels likewise a pausable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have found freedom, and Minsk is ready for small comparisons with Moscow, always recognizing the South Hosea and Abazzia separate from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus is a paper conference, considers the two independent territory for a month.
"We have made two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important is that the dialogue has been decorated between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Milinkevitch in our journal.
According to the candidate to the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that this remains, despite "the power has been feared in this Parliament, which has no weight, to make even one opposite".
The opposition does not prevail protests in view of the results; it is rather trying to reach its message on the need for economic reforms to the electors.
"Of course, we have many concerns on this side: we have to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, local authorities put us in the wheels for the distribution, but I can also see that they are more supporting elections, even in the circle of the elderly people," Milinkevitch said, refering to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, which considers social security as its main result, the box of the most supported retraits officially does not consider it really appropriate.
"Furthermore, because of the deduction of the country and the increase of trade deficit, the decrease of social security, "declaring the silence of a cemetery" is only a question of time," Milinkevitch states.
In contrast to the political of opposition, Russian observers have qualified democracy elections.
Serguei Lebedev, managing the mission of the Community of independent States, said to the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "The people do not believe in words, but in acts."
Brunetta: "From today, a little dinner before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, we had no turning doors for the input and output of the employees.
But from today, this new measure is in force against the small males, which points to and then will drink the café in the bar during the hours of work.
The new anti-fairness has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council's Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The turning gates-ra- Brunetta- are a tool for better work, with more productivity, more presence and more services", states the Minister.
Now start a new responsibility and transparency season.
"It's reform" also stresses Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the Council's Presidency is completed with the Palace Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning gates is even important of a symbolic viewpoint.
No resistance from the employees has been registered, assure the Secretary-General: "This is a process shared by the employees, and we have been all.
Shortly, more than a little breakfast during the hours of work; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, who suggests, "a good cappu ́no at 7:00 of the morning is a great and healthy resolution."
At a conference to the Supreme School of Administration
of Rome, the Minister, that "in three months, the absence of illness of public employees was reduced by 50%, or 60 million workers more than one year."
And it calls that it is necessary to make more effective, the Public Administration.
The Italian, "does the salarial dynamics," explains the Minister, which has doubled in relation to the private sector in the last 8-10 years, and also inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees agreed to contest the standards of Brunetta decree, which resort to Codacons.
"before today the Ministry of the Eastern Public Function of the data on the decreasing of absentism on the workplace due to illness- written the consumer's people - the people of the " active workers" - continues to act.
In fact, in Italy, thousands of employees of the right and productive Public Administration gathered to declare war to the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exclusion of additional allocations in cases of injustice for service; the prolongation of the hours of the homelife of the sick worker, during which control visits have been carried out and other aspects contained in the new provisions provided by the Minister.
Age on the workplace, Napolitano: "Creatival Prevention"
Each day, in Italy, 2,500 work accidents, 3 dead and 27 people remain invalid permanently.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that white dead were approximately 00.
Numbers showing the severity of the phenoeder that remain one of the main causes of death and cause almost twice more death than killers.
In order to take attention to the institutions, social forces and information on this dramatic aspect, the famous Year today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of the victims of work, instituted on October second Sunday.
"The concernful data exposed by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of these last days confirm the importance of the prevention on the workplace," says the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, during a message sent to the Chairman of the Anmil, the nationality of the mutilated and invalid workers, Pietro Mercanda.
The Chairman of the State expresses its sincere appreciation for the continuous efforts to prevent the workplace prevention, the protection of accidental workers, the assistance to the victims' families and the adoption of the opinion"
"naturally indignantly, everyone struck the pound to end such tragedies that, by their dimension, highlight the claim of media and the participation of the opinion, even if the daily reality presents us dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that there is certainly a resource problem: it is important to invest in training and information"
Many initiatives promoted in the school sector are particularly important for a more direct consciousness of young people who enter the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomena, not under assessing the social severity alarm, applying and improved isolating standards.
On its hand, the President of the Room Gianfranco Fini highlighted how much "this phenomenon of white dead is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and forces all institutions to make a concrete effort to quickly end it."
The data of accidents on work reports a positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white dead even as impressive" subsequently highlighted the President of Anmil Pietro Mercanda.
"We don't want this "grabing" to be actually translated into a lower attention, because it's just when the attention is relaxing, which comes from tragedy.
"We believe us generally, we do not enough to contrast the phenomena of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"We have emphasized Mercanda- more inspections and inspections, as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from the oil."
- He said, "the more effort must be made in relation to communication and the raising of the opinion.
"But especially, a greater sense of the responsibility of employees against a phenomena that represents a social emergency."
" Mercanda" has then stated "the progressive detection of the conditions of safeguarding of the compensation intended for the victims of the work" and "the result of assistance to which the system is in the past years".
"The goal, therefore, is to restore the assurance guarantee to the worker – has it so that the destination of the person who has an accident must not depend on spontaneism or the extension of the islator"
Reader Mp3 pointed out of the finger, they risk audition.
Listen to full volume music during a prolonged period using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent lesions to hear.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a broadcast in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the unprecedented and recently identified health risks of the EU (Csrseri) today.
"On this scientific report, we read in the note that 5-10% of those who, during a period of at least 5 years, listen to full volume music using portable musical devices for more than one hour per week, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I'm worried that such a number of young people who often use phone music and phones with full volume can unconsciously damage their audience in an unreparable way," Meglena Kuneva states.
"The scientific data continues to be the responsible for Ue- this is a risk and we must respond quickly.
The most important thing is to enhance consumers and provide these public information.
In addition, we need to review existing control systems in view of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow the news."
Brussels requested the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase of the number of young people exposed to the voice that they generate.
"The scientists-concluded Ue- confirm that there are good reasons for anxiety, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties, which measures may be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against the voice exposure from portable and similar musical devices.
There is already a European security standard that limits the level of sounding of musical devices to 100Db, but anxiety increases the hearing damage that could result from an exposure to such sound sources.
It is possible to limit these data which result in solutions such as reduction of levels and duration of voice exposure.
The Scientific Committee notes that the users of mobile musical devices, who listen to full volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceeds currently the current limits relating to maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions during long-term periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This interests 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to approximately 2.5 and 10 million people in the United States.
Rome, Germany ordered the Commission to leave for the future of capital.
Today we start, in March, we end, in June, we'll take ours.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the Travels of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning, at the new seat, behind the Termes of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will set up the directives for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Joint Council will evaluate the analysis and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategy Plan for Rome with the " official term " of the Capitol and its Master Gianni Germanno.
"The Committee is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there- it is to emphasize Germany- it will have to propose ideas of Rome ' s development which will be able to be used by political decisionnaires, remaining the Committee and the Communal Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the will of a corner where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, it will finish its tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a specific period of time.
In June, the Major will present the strategic plan of the work made by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale. "
For those who accuse the Commission to be unnecessary, since its opinions will not be binding, Germany answers: "All of the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France, thanks to the Commission Attali, as in Rome, I am sure, it'll be possible.
Policy is too often appealed to the management of daily and emergencies that are in time.
On the contrary, we want to see from before and far to a deeper perspective, working seriously in Rome's development and his future."
In addition, the Master of Rome has to stress that "the Commission is not an unusual body or a bureaucratic entity: it is absolutely free and will not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to study and participate in the best initiatives expressed by the Capitale.
For Germany, in fact, "there is needed a strategy of reference, neither close nor immobile, in order to allow our city to improve, which it absolutely needs, thinking about its future, "
A future which, as the Master of Rome, "not will be limited to common borders, but will look far away" not only in the opticity of the future Metropolitan city and its legal status of Capitale, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
A famous American politician who wants to be independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, partly, destroyed the US economy and reported (as he always has today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks against Obama increase while the date of elections is approached.
A Lady of Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is really curious: he thinks he will win the highest function of a nation that counts at all, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, this is attacks that do not say much; it is obviously racial attacks, and they do not answer the question of all electors: will it be a good president? We have also the investigations, which all say that Obama will win and with good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A journal of Mississipi, in the entrances of the Southern United States, wrote a article: Once in the vote cabin, we know who the American patriote will give his vote.
This is a aspect of the American mentality that has been kept secret until the end.
"Tell what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or on McCain.
There are even people who swore: if Obama wins, we'll leave the United States.
Never revealed choices until now, as the success of the black candidate almost certain.
Despite all these reasons, the victory card for democracy is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent back to her at the feet.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to make valises.
Nevertheless, Iraq was most of Bush's weakness point.
Who's gonna take George W's place will have a big tack to do.
Usa, the economic disaster even feels among journalists: in the press, it's the time of elimination. And many accuses the Internet, this "eye" of the journal paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been interplyed by the Research Center on the status of their professional and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimists about their future.
However, they didn't openly state to the accusers of the information, but they felt less concerned about the credibility.
They don't feel isolated as ever.
The problem of American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a devastated economic model crisis.
Furthermore, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work at the newsgroom assembly, are a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, and the interviewed journalists, if it is wished that traditional journalism, such as the large public, does not reduce it accordingly.
A clear but complex pessimism involves American journalism.
Six of the ten exemplary and journalists of printing journalists are convinced that journalism at national level is following a bad way.
Locally, the ex-effective group is 65%.
Publication printed against broadcast.
The journalists don't have a problem to see where the web goes.
The biggest editory houses are spent a passage to the Internet, considered by many as "the" of the journal paper.
The "economic pressure" of journalists is increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted to the hope that she would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the largest increase in the American journalism is among those who lead newsrooms, namely directors and reporters who work for them.
56% of the national directors are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level, this percentage decreases to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "security of work".
Directors who think to lose their job in three years are 47% at national level.
As regards journalists, we're going to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists are working under contract.
In a large nation like Usa, with 300 million residents and thousands of journalists, revises, radio, television and Internet, employees often offer what they want, and this becomes quickly a question to take or leave.
Directors almost always receive big salaries, while the editor can win $10,000 per month, besides the rental and payment of insurance.
As regards holidays, logic becomes complex: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days at all, spent a number of years.
However, their revelations, the American journalists, are often "maled" during the year.
That's the mistake of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIIBUNAL ROM, Daniel Coppol remains to the Great Ferrate.
The President of the second penal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the immobile agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a room in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for bankroute in the UNipol-Bnl education.
In the last week, during his charge, he had received the freedom of home transformed into obligatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have asked that the real estate agent might be able to park the road from the city of province to a living in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (which the pm has not granted) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence of accusation.
Elites in danger.
The phenomena has already been manifested a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the 700 billion dollars saving plan approved by the White House: a great number of Americans was more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the American economy.
And this is the New York Times yesterday confirming that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its watch, East Coast, moderated, favorable to the federal institutions and business, and its new, rather, conservative, enemy to "the people of Washington" and the world of the finance, especially in the Central and South States.
The vote I talked to you at the beginning was just a depotetic way.
However, what has just been mentioned is only an example of changes, large changes that the current economic land tremblement already predicts or leaves to run: not only in the United States, but in the whole of the United States, and may not only be here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis has accelerated the phenomenon covered for a while, so that in the new climate they are solid and revealed.
The first of these phenomenon is the renewal, the extraordinary renewal, of the double category of the Sovereign State, compared to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is, in fact, a crisis of financial institutions that, obviously, have close relationships with the foreigner, but which are, in particular, largely involved in the billions of people and families living in one country, in one State.
This immediately creates a political problem for which he is governed: it is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also a electorate.
Shortly, the crisis appears economically worldwide but politically, it is almost national.
The political internationalization is really out of the game or well, not much to say: the evident evidence is provided by the European Union that, sharing as a habit, between the various interests and the various national strategies, cannot decide any common political line.
And this is the government of each State that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and particularly a loan-friend: when a difficult period is passed, there are only States who have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that are capable of trying to replace things.
They also have the necessary means and the stimulation to use them: two resources of an inestimable value, elements of which no market or international organisation will be available in the same way.
This new emphasis of the state-nation crisis is the rest perfectly in accordance with the importance of the more recent economic developments of the economy: territoriality.
. Paradoxally, while we were convinced that we were now entered into the Kingdom of the Network, of the more sophisticated, non-material, convinced that globalized financing was now intended to dominate the world, we have noticed that our future would still have to regulate its accounts with little material things like water, collections, oil.
Things that may be transported from one place to another from the earth, but which are linked absolutely to a circuit space, to a territory.
So, who is sovereign, surely has more cards than he who is not it, that is, he who has the evil to live in a place without collection, without oil and without water.
I am now coming to the second newness that, however, provides a fraction.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and then Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis produces two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the conscience of the need for authorityal leadership, the search of a person who knows to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a vague of discretion for existing leaders, economic species that have become inadequate and full of shadow areas.
Moreover, something more deep incorruptible, in some sense, even anxious: a discretion, a sufffrance, an image of indequation, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the whole class of directors in a growing number of countries of O.H.
This increases the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of social elite until now to their appreciation, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be more stranger to the opinions of the majority.
Shortly, the request for leadership, food in subterraneous way, a powerful and reduced movement of delegations of leading classes and traditional political orders, which are manifested in the improved " electoral" revolts or well, in the changes in collective humors of these last days, from the conservative approach in Austria Bavière, to the fall of the worklists in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congressists against Bush (and it might be well that the right victory in Italy has not reached by hazard).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their journals, their intellectual credits, their formats, may say that somebody still have more difficulties, which do not give today, to understand and therefore represent the deep beds of the Western companies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and acts potentially demeasedly.
In view of all this, talking about the current "rebellion of masses" on the agenda, sincerely exagered.
But we're saying, keeping the eyes open, that's not without reason.
The supercolle to walk on the walls.
Overcome gravity laws through a super colle and, in the future, walk on the parous like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today a team of four institutions has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measured almost 2.5 square metres, researchers succeeded to maintain a body of 100 kg on a vertical paroi.
ETUDE- The American Science magazine has covered some researchers at the Dayton University, Accron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the researcher team, is an evolution of those we know who use a special carbon structure called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of the cold can be imagined as a series of tubes disposed as a spaghetti pile." Explain Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists inspired from the geckos patts, covered by microscopic poles that enables the animal to be a perfect adherent.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, showed that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the patts of these reptils, and at the same time, it easily declines from the paroi” explains Liming Dai, researcher of the Engineering University of Dayton.
MARCHER ON THE MURS? –"This material could be used as temporary adhesive" → Liming Dai.
Can it be to walk on the parses like Spiderman? It may be, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since the nano carbon tubes are heat and electric core drivers.
Other applications may affect airspace engineering.
For instant, not super heroes.
Other RECHERCHE - The University of Berkeley in California is also dedicated to seeking a new adhesive.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive for microfibres as hair, which cleanses the powder during moving on a surface to ensure a perfect and constant adherence.
Medicinal products: never with fruit juices.
Attention to juice of pamplemousse, oral and pome.
These drinks, particularly consumed in the sea, because disalterated and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vitamin medicines, have changed the absorption that enhances or reduces the cases, their efficiency, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, reminds the risks of fruit juices that they are, in wood or fresh, associated with the injection of certain medicines; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadel ́e, he launchs a new alarm: it is sufficient for a glass of pamplemousis, oran and pommes, to reduce the absorption of certain living medicines, cancelling their benefits and risking the health of patients.
Pamplemousse juice has already been strongly criticized because it has been held responsible for the effects of some arithmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, staminale and neurological medicines, up to toxic levels.
MEDICINES A RISQUE - This is the Italian Medicinal Agency itself, who has given the news in a two-year information bulletin, warning the doctors and patients not to evaluate the risk resulting from this mixture and to take care of what you drink, if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
WHAT PAMPLEMOUSSE - According to experts, even the oral and powder juice contains substances that inhibit medicines.
Long is the list of active principles inhibited by the pamplemousse and the other jus.
Furthermore, the call of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "thes are generally covered, immediately reported to the various national and international medical agencies that will need to change the information notes of medicines.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the medicines we take, and, if something is not, not to be impressed, but to address the doctor or pharmacist" stressed the expert to the Ansa Agency.
The Economy's Nobel to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Economy Price was assigned to the American Paul Krugman for its research on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a new-Kinesian who teaches Princeton University and is also a famous editor of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critical solutions in the economic and foreign policy of Bush administration.
A few months after the arrival of September 2001, during the days of Enron's failure, Krugman wrote in a article on New York Times that the second event would have been more determining than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A preview that has declined from many polymetics, which has been reproached to the economy for years, but which now has become accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked about the speed with which the memory of scandals such as Enron or Worldcom's exhaustion disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the ex-committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "valuable economy", but also a very aggressive divulgator, especially critical to the excess of Bush's liberalism.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity that aims to touch always and even more users, from the house to the office, professionals to the administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost one year, performed by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown in the large public with various news: of the welcome, and the interface is revised and become less outer, other more important, such as the compatibility created for the Apple Mac OS X operational system, and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) ↓, the last ISO standard version.
Open Office focused particularly on interaction with the Office sequence 2007, and it is actually possible to open documents with the new Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some specific functions for some modules, such as those who allow to reduce the sizes of PowerPoint presentations, for example useful to send them via electronic core, or to import PDF file into the graphical processing module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "Hybrides PDF" documents that join the typical graphic of the Adobe format to the elements of a calculation faith or a text manufacturer.
A number of persons are an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the calculation fe, several users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the processing of texts, because each operator is assigned a color of comments for a better review phase.
Some companies are even working to bring certain functions of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is aligned to the English version on the mirror since Friday.
Besides Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may be sent at home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of freedom can be a way to spread it in the houses, it is just in the business that Open Office will then try the big challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in the administration and schools.
Without counting the realities that offer training, consultation and assistance services, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could otherwise open to business perspectives.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Write, for Word equivalent video; Calc, is the calculation fe to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint Rival Presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on databases; Drawa is finally the graphical module.
Objective for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that there are almost 3 million and 600 miles today, it is worth that with the output of the new version, it can even exceed the estimated number.
Kohl, too, is positive, is the fourth case of do.
New case of positiveness in the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian team of Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best gripper maillot.
This is the daily site The Team reports the news.
In 26ans, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the Epo of the third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and ________________________________________________________________________________________________
Blood analysis carried out on Kohl's tests are part of those performed in recent weeks by Lausanne and Chatenay-Mala laboratories.
If an analysis confirms the positiveness of Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place at the Tour and must expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positiveness at the Epo of the third generation, was confirmed by the leader of the French Antido, Pierre Bordry, who had notified the Associated Press positiveness to the Austrian authorities.
The Austrian 26ans placed on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus reflecting the maillot for the best gripper.
New York Times asks if Italia is racist?
Italy "as immigrant countries recently became a privileged destination for the immigrants" accepted with reticence.
Whether this would transform the Beau country into a nation of racistes? This is what the New York Times who has dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, as part of the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originating in Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a bucket of biscuits.
This case shows what New York Times defines as the "Norther Paradox": Northern regions are both those where we are recorded" more integration and more work, but also "a strongest anti-immigrated feeling in the country and the most important support to the North Lega"
In order to confirm the growing stress between Italian and immigrants, NYT also referred to Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new islator wanted by the Lega to free immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clandestins is cited as a evidence of climate change in Italy.
Tendance stressed by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benoit XVI in Quirinal asked the State and the Church to overcome racism."
Sacrifice students of dear loans, up to 900 euros for a room.
The location market for students was not known as a crisis
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the site syndicate can cost a simple room to a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomena has now reached very serious aspects to exclude all youth categories, the right to study because of very high global costs that the family of origin must support," explains the responsibility of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong request of the students has so deformed the market that a generalized employment process has been decorated for residents.
In most cases, location offers also have a series of violations: free, uncontained contracts, without loans limits, sublocals.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the fiscal tax revision are necessary to calm prices.
In detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza, there are about 450 euros; for a simple room, we are going at a average of EUR 650 to a average of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of EUR 900 (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a average cost bed, EUR 350/400, a room of approximately EUR 700.
In Bologne, where students are in the nearest areas of the University, 250/280 euros are required for a double bed, and 370 to 500 for a simple room.
In Rome, near the centre universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), approximately 600 euros are requested for a simple, 450 for a double bed.
Lower values (550 euros for a simple) for the nearby areas of other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
Only if it is remote in periferic areas:300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the Preestina, Centocelle or Similar area.
In Naples, a bed needs 300/400 euros, for a simple cost of 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Amminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, 250/350 euros must be calculated, at least 350 for a simple.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have great importance in the citizen economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which places are often taken by extra Community students, are recorded a later error: the law requested for foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to the Italian.
Bye old movie Paradiso, the towns swimming the historical rooms.
History film rooms closed for the Multiplex.
"A city without film rooms is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The picture offered by the scenario Giuseppe Tornatore illustrates well what happens in the large Italian cities, but also in the provinces,
The process of marginalization of films, with the birth of the big multisalons, and the death of consumption of mono rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that appear to us inevitable and instabil; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When disappearing, they are often historical and memory-loaded places, "is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone with whom we have shared a lot of road and so many emotions" observes the new cinema Paradiso scenario, the film offered to Tornator 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Great Price of Cannes' jury, and tells the poesi of a province room, and the nostalgie in a way to live the film can be lost forever.
The numbers provided by Anec, the main trademakers, want to say everything: In the past five years, 316 traditional cinema have closed, and these are the main towns' rooms that pay the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologne and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palerma.
Among the most touched regions, Emily Roman is headed with 82 mono-sale movies, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardie (41).
The evidence confirms that the first responsibility for their disappearance is the event of the multiplex, because these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multisalal films: 195 scrans in Lombardie in the past five years, 81 in Toscana as Emilie-Romany.
"The Italian exploitation has developed in irrational manner" notes Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "is useful to build new structures, but it should also ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a close room is in a city, these frequencies are not necessarily ready to go to multiplex.
Without talking about the lack of credit debt for the trademakers: the State's previous debt is about 10 million euros.
It is proud that the Government does not respect existing laws in a ethical and moral manner.
To support the sector, 16 to 18 million euros per year would be required.
Let us note the case of Bologne, the first Italian city, who, in anxiety for these fermentations, decided to solve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mary and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to defend and promote the mono-room films of historical centres and periferia.
Among the rules provided, there are measures for tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in mobility: spectators will be able to enter the limited employment area and will have special tariffs for stationing and certain parkings.
"This is a initiative that I like" notes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologne, making other measures.
However, it is obvious that, to contrary the super power of multiples, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, since today's public is more needed.
The defense of the traditional movie is a topic that has always been important for me: the closing of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adultery, was the scene that convinced me to do "New Paradiso film" which I thought since 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I have passed before the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Naة, now closed, where I have so much shared emotions, I turn from the other side to not see the black panels by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘Drangheta, arrested by Gioia Tauro.
"The Master of Gioia Tauro was willing to uniformize the elections of María to the interests of the piroma clan."
Difficulties are the judges of the Antimafia Directory of Calabre, towards the Major and Major of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, and Rosario Schiavione, and the Master of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external concurrence for mafia.
Manettes also for Gioacchino Piroma, the old mediator between the clan and the administrations, and his little son, homonymous of the boss, already condemned for mafia malfactors, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"a matter with legal and legal legislation, and especially with good sense" writes the prosecutors, both local administrations had expressed the will of paying consultations to Master Piroma.
"Instead, it would have been granted to the clan - writing the judges - to formally enter within the Majors to facilitate, already considerable, control and orientation of the administration"
The Chairman of the Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, is only hiding "conclusions between local committees and organized criminality, there are more than one" in its region: "There are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the employment is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the andrangheta, the heroes who are honest."
The arrests of this morning follow the last July, after which the police announced that Piroma’s clan had been discaped.
Since the end of April, the Joint Council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always because of prejudices between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their duty to govern the town.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Major of the UDC at the time of the dissolving, was appointed head of a right center coalition after the ballotage of May 2006.
He cried to the scandal when prefecture ordered the resolution of the Common Council.
He was the Minister of Interior at the time, Marco Min日, who claimed to have managed everything for a political issue, but because of the request to be signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piroma clan had even succeeded to ask the variation of the A3 project.
In order to intercede against Dal Torrione, the Pm writers, " the ability to marry the needs of a businessman, representative of a closer group of Piroma, which uniformizes the choices of administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born of waves, the big are now running.
This is a dismissed shipment that takes over 70% of the planet's surface and now the large world energy companies are discovering it.
Vagues, cornants, married, here are the new renewable sources on which the collapses like Chevron have put their eyes, and now they are trying to put the hand there.
The potential of energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, together with the first oil crisis, research has increased.
When the oil price was decreased, to 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put on the side, but now the GEological institutions and the new oil growth give a great rise to the sector.
London World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's election need could be covered by the sea's exploitation systems.
This amount would be the double of the nuclear centres produced.
Moreover, there would be coronants and married.
Colosses to the attack.
The first undertaking on marine energy was Enersis, who in 2005 signed an agreement to build a installation in North Portugal.
When the hearing was announced, it would have been said a real revolutionary step.
In two years of this, more candidates among these firms dedicated to traditional energy have been put on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying the Property on Ocean Energy," said the portfolio of a company associated with the American Oil Coloss, the Wall Street Journal economic day, and she evaluates the opportunities to cooperate with us.
The cooperation concerned concerns the obtaining of a licence determined by the American Energy Committee, which is necessary to provide a draft Marine Energy Operation in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered just in Alaska, the Usa continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has established a project for new excavations.
Besides Chevron, there is Ver ́ Power Inc. New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, who park the way of energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested up to today, although their details are not with ́, indicate the observers, a growing interest.
Technology to set up.
Experts are talking about one more at its beginning, partly the fact that marine energy does not dismiss fears against ιological impact.
Currently, systems such as Portugal, or some in Ecosse, are small, and do not create a big problem with the ↓osem.
In order to produce great energy, however, it is necessary to be used with a higher impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of bottles connected to each other.
The powder of the waves, which makes the woods move up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylindres inside the floorers.
Pression makes a turbine turning around it, eating a generator.
Energy is sent to the river through cabs under sea.
Instead, we have four systems of this type of project phase, expecting a single federal approval and a part of energy could serve to a military installation.
Ver日 Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a trade center and a parking using six turbines under the East River of New York.
The water movement at the mars, turning the turbines' balls, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Ver ́ announced to have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisations to strengthen energy.
After the waves, the wheels.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Energy Research, which currently deserves the potential of the marine.
Although it is a intermittent phenomena, the marine is closer to the wind, sun, or vague, and so more reliable as energy source.
And it is just about the energy of the marines that states such as New York and Alaska, with others, looking towards the coasts, invested 7 million and half dollars in 2008 and provided up to 35 million in 2009.
