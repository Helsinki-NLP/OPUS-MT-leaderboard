In the last time, you're making a move.
You're doing a move in the last time.
You eat.
You ate.
You've been praying.
You prayed to him.
You've been praying.
You've been crazy.
You've been studying.
One day it'll be a hate.
One day, you're gonna be a boyfriend.
You're gonna have a beautiful exception on the sea.
You're gonna work on the beach.
You wrote a book!
Njam!
