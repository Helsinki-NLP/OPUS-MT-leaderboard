Food due to inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation in the euro zone is the racial increase in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the Eurozone, honey was expected in November, after 2.6 pro in October, a yearly inflation rate of 3.1 Pro, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Of the prognoses have been issued from only 3 Pro, reported Bloomberg.
In contrast to the British, Canadian, and Canadian note bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the guidelines; the reduction of the increased prices of hazards and the easily reduction of unemployment would contribute to the creation of a inflation spirit.
The ECB is stressed to maintain the rate of inflation under two Pro, or at least at least at the two-pro-mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the mixture: the inflation must be "repeated" to exclude the need for later action.
With 3,3 Pro, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record in Germany in November; in Spain the rate of 3,6 to 4,1 Pro.
Inflation in the euro zone is responsible for the increase in food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat notes increased by 88 Pro, and the course for sojabones has also reached a record since 1973.
Furthermore, food oil and milk products were significantly hungry in 2007.
The world price for Roh oil increased by 52 Pro in this year - the price per fass of black gold reached nearly 100 US in the past month.
According to the ECB, the inflation will increase from 2.1 to 2.5% in 2008, however, 2009 with a decrease of 1.9%.
For the coming 3-4 months, analysts come out of a 3-pro-inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.5.
Experts estimate that the ECB will decrease the rates twice for 2008.
Gallup is a government crisis
After long stagnition, the number of Fidesz sympathisants has grown significantly until the beginning of December. First of 2002, the party has reached the largest basic camper, while the approval of the socialists says Gallup has never reached a present depth of 13 Pro.
In the part-time electors, the subsection is clearly expressed by the high resolution of the opposition behaviour: more than two thirds (71 per_) are a fifth (20%) appropriation against the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are under Parliamentary income inquiry: they come to the total population to two Pro.
The number of parties choosers is weakened in both stores around a pro.
In comparison to the last deep point, the global economic vote has continued to be harmful - never before, the share of those who consider the country's economies as "pronounced bad" was so high (41 Pro).
After hopeful views in the early and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population calculates another deterioration of the situation; only a decimal degree comes from a improvement.
A question made by Gallup in December showed that 71% of the questionnaires - a historical higher - were considered the work of the Prime Minister as "earlier bad than right".
Three Pro of the Questioners have large confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the portion of Viktor Orbán 38 Pro.
54% do not trust the Governing Boss at all, compared to 27% disbelieving against Fidesz's partnership.
One of the indicators of the political vote is the number of those who believe that the incompatibleness with the president can also be obtained without government change.
In the past October, 35% of the rest of the Government and the Governing Boss have been expressed by the injuries, this share is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
As a question of their interest in the national vote, 60 Pro replied that they would "securely" parties, and more 20% would give their vote "probably".
Similarly, if Parliament's elections were located on Sunday, only 55% would "securely" go to the urnes, more 15% would hold their participation as "probably".
74% would vote against the taxes, 79% against the practical taxes, and 84% against the hospital rate.
The group of "secure" participants in the national vote would also be acquired by the counterparts of the opponents of 81, 84 and 89 Pro.
Auchan in the first, Tesco added about almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Buddhist trade area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% of the last year, subdividing that this year there was no increase in additional tax.
Articles from Napi Gazdasag
In the Buddhist trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas Corbe of Napi has also increased by 16% this year, however, in all hypermarked price increases were registered by more than 1000 HUF.
After the prices in the food markets in the past December have been "davongagnate" in the past December, the hunger is probably not drastic, compared to the high, previous level of start.
However, the consumers are certainly disturbing that, for which they have paid under 9.000 HUF in the last year, it is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" goods cover exceeds the magical 100,000-HUF limits of at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The maximum price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800, the price was 6.800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and living fish remained almost at the previous year, but the prices for the putten brush pellets, nuss and moon are strong.
Prices for meal and bread resulted from the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but in Auchan there were 1 kg breadweaves for 139 forint.
There was no competitive price disorder under 200 forint in the product.
At the same time, the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola pfan flash of under 200 forint was surprising, so the drink costed only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year, the "Napi" comparison of the goods corbs, and Cora, the most favorable.
Our beliefs have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" goods corb to the Christmas prices last year at 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 Pro.
The difference between the most balanced good corbe of the previous year and the most deepest of today's year was 12%, while the increase between the balanced good corbe of the past year and the deepest of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price increase was still at 1.206,00 forint in the previous year, but the additional tax increase at prices was notable at last Christmas.
That is exactly what the trade has occurred: it appears that the households could not decide exactly what price range they should apply in the individual articles, since the impact of price increase on consumption was inconsistent.
(If the trader plants the cycle speed of a product badly, it may fall to significant winning in the price range that is addressed to the intensity of the product.)
In the past year, the powder of the "Napi" goods corb was so radical that the deepest corb exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, while the price decline was only 844 forint.
This year, such extréms were not observed because the highest corb costed at 1.630,00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even in the most costly, there was a price increase of ↓84.00 Forint.
In comparison with the last two Christmas seasons, a disastrous price increase showed the price of the daily consumption articles in the hypermarkets was decreased in less than 20 months of more than 30%.
(The data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary are not necessarily valid: In some basic feeds, the statistical Office has established more than 30 percent of thirty months during the period of 12 months.
As in approximately meal, also in eggs.)
However, if you have a corner in the "Napi" goods corbe, this seems almost impossible in the last time, since the price level of the product already in the previous year is even in the worst case of a little more than 10%.
Apparently, meal suppliers were in a stronger position than the suppliers - they could always get the drastic price increase to the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets are not complained; it is reported for good years.
Our experience shows that most of the customers in the three goods houses are not looking at the prices anymore.
They are purchased from all large quantities, sustainable foods go into palettes over the ladentics.
In the middle of the morning, there were unfinished serpents in all three houses of goods in the cassa, when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so that many of the researchers complained that they could not even achieve the planned implementation, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption.
places are deleted to defectives
More than thousand infections were registered in hospitals that were caused to an inappropriate treatment with antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in hospitals, the overlook of beds, the overload of staff - everything that is not rightly relevant to infections, as the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology area.
It is also deleted in the disinfectation medicines.
A MRSA infection was recently enhanced in the Traumatology Department of Janos hospital.
The antibiotic resistant bacteria was found in a manly patient who was delivered into the hospital after a severe accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The damage of a severe car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. A major operation could not be performed since the bacteria that still exists in the patient body.
By 10 December this year, infections issued by multiresistent infections were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, so the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology’s National Epidemiology, Karolina Böröcz.
Thus, so many, multi-resistent infections have been registered in the hospitals with security, but dark digits may be.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were solved by MRSA, the staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicilin oxaciline.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria has about one third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-conditioned infections (e.g. hallow infection, mandel infection, skin inflammation or wounds) are most well reacting to antibiotics, they are well healthy.
However, if the resources are too high or inappropriately applied, the antibiotic resistants of the well-reacting bacteria, which are rapidly spread in the hospitals under relevant conditions.
In the case of patients with weak or permanently bad immune system, but also in elderly, or in a low body weight, these bacteria may cause severe infections such as wound infection or blood infection, so sepsis.
According to his head of the Janos hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such events belong to Kra's household day.
You should not change the infection with the epidemic, moving Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is not only where it is not searched.
Resistent against antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the supervisory staff carries gummi hands and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment," so Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are studied in MRSA when they are given to hospital, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Receptions of tests to rarely
The majority of infections exposed to MRSA in hospitals would be preventable, but the currently governing conditions and circumstances are unnecessary for the deterioration or spread of the multi-resident inhibitor, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and older homes, the hospitals should investigate the injected patients and isolate MRSA inhibitors immediately.
However, in the Hungarian hospitals, microbiological samples are not practiced so often.
It is not unfortunate because there is no exception for this investigation from the State hospital box.
Therefore, most of the cases are at the light of the day when the patient already has a significant MRSA infection, so its leadership of epidemiology.
From the part of the European Union, there are strike recommendations on the appropriate application of antibiotics in human medicines, but in Hungary there are also directives on the treatment of certain infections and disease images.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, which means that microbiological investigations are needed in order to avoid resisting the fund, but this Directive of hospitals is not always implemented.
Microbiological samples are even rare, as Karolina Böröcz.
Part of the defectives
economic evidence shows that MRSA is most frequently transferred from a patient to the other by the supervisory staff.
That is why the handwater, or the wearing of hands and masks, is very important, but there are also significant deficiencies in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is overcome by infection or contact, but in the home hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the patients in .
The rooms are even often overflow, the beds are closely broken together, although it should be a distance of at least 1,5 meters from epidemiological view.
As Karolina Böröč continues to note, unfortunately, in the financially less well-infirmed hospitals even occurs that there are few infections, many patients - all that are favorable to infections.
Such infections are evidently less frequency, in the meaning of Karolina Böröcz, the further spread of the successor can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
To obtain MRSA infections, the hospital insurance causes great costs, so they will be combated overall.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or their entry into the Government programme, was observed.
According to the first signs, the program - as shown by data, the trend of MRSA infections in England is delayed.
The European Centre for disease Prevention (ECDC) has explained the prevention of the development of multi-resistance investigators (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities.
Deathlink Police Boss was not drunk
In the case of the police officer of the XXII. A car accident caused by the dead outcome is now the official opinion.
Atila Morvai, the press speaker of the Budapest Supreme Advocate of the Board on Friday after the official observations were submitted.
The view was the results of the first investigation, as the police officer had not consumed alcohol before he was imposed on tax.
The former police officer books with his own pkw in XXII. The district entered the Cossuth Lajos Street and passed over a 55-year-old man who passed the street at an unknown place.
(Sounds STVO, however, this is not a mild situation - the linker has, even if footpassers don't cross the street at the Zebra street, the degree.)
The footstep has taken his damage after he was entered into the hospital.
According to police reports, the linker takes a shock, then puts his functions back and requests pension.
The Budapest State Advocate has started its investigations.
In addition, Attila Morvai recognized that the former police officer had cooperated with the mediators from the beginning.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Financial Minister Janos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) underlined three credit agreements at Budapest on Friday, at the total value of EUR 400 million.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a 300 million EUR framework for the financing of projects for foreign and environmental protection, which are implemented with subsidies from the Cohesion Fund.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan contract will also be applied to the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the rest of EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit contract.
In the field of innovation, the contracting partners have made an agreement over EUR 50 million, which will lead mainly to research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the U-Bahnline 4 also came to the language.
It was agreed that Hungary suddenly declared the details of the U-Bank funding with the EU, the original Treaty and possible modalities will be discussed again.
According to Janos Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed in Hungary 113 projects at the total value of EUR 8.4 billion.
The credit prices are linked to EURIBOR, the loans shall be provided by the EIB with an eight-year expenditure, free of provision.
Bulgaria, the EU's Immobility Paradise
The development of Bulgaria's immobility is fabelous - all Europe looks carefully on the former rare Balkan state.
What, where, and who's still buying the more balanced market in the EU, but who's going to be racially higher?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently the most desired flaster for immobility purchases in the east room, with favorable ski apartments and households on the sea.
Among the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most popular regions, in the sea are Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Son Coast", and the historical towns of Sozopol and Nessebar, however, immobilies around Kavarna and Baltic are still more asked.
Following estimates of Re/Max Analysts in Bulgaria, the country's households are also added to former or later investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the pronounced favorative area of Russia makes more buyers.
The main city of Sofia also offers locking boats - trade and office areas offer the highest rental.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive golf Paradises, thus blocking tourists near the summer and winter season in the two other years.
Thus, previewing investors already buy in a large style, for example around Bansko.
Analysts suggest that people who purchase immobility in Bulgaria also seek to change their life change.
Most buyers are England, but there are also interested people from France, Others, Spain, and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to leave are buying revitalised real estate about 50-100,000 euros, or lost houses of 5-15,000 euros, which they will then renew themselves.
Good connection and accessibility and communication opportunities are largely written, but the closer to a large city, business and doctors are also decisive for the purchasers.
The second category belongs to those who are on the search for a fermentomizil (Bulgaria was listed in December under the Top Ten Holiday goals of Germany).
The group represents businessmen investing with the aim of a medium-and long-term value increase.
Immobility in the main city is increasingly increasing, for example by the always growing demand.
Inside the EU, the prices of immobility are lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years there was an increase in prices about 21% annually.
Hazard at the prices of immobility exceeds the highlight of the containers.
Fodor and six Hungarian percent
As the Ministry of Environment Gabor Fodor gab, expert meetings end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers in the middle of the midweek after official exemption.
Experts and experts from 192 countries were consulted on the Bali Road Plan, where the emission reduction measures were established for the period after 2012, so after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
It is currently a strong debate between industrial and developing countries.
The United States have already signaled that they do not want to negotiate with specific numbers, but they would be ready to reduce the gas emissions by 25-40% until 2020 in comparison to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether industrial countries are ready to submit both financially and financially, beyond reduction of emissions.
There was also an agreement on the support of developing countries.
The Adjustment Fund submitted to the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-country Council, in particular in the global environmental facility (GEF) of the United Nations, as follows in Piac er Profit.
Hungarian six Pro
Environmental Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its role in global climate protection measures and to achieve a new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU will reduce the emissions of gases by 20% by 2020 (measured by the values of 1990), regardless of whether the "Accord after 2012" will be achieved or not. The Union would even be ready to apply for a 30% reduction, if other large industrial countries in the world and developing countries are also ready to comply with their obligations after forces and responsibilities.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries accessed to the Kyoto Protocol 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 Pro, while the EU with its 15 Member States had already committed to a 8% minimum.
The standard for Hungary is the reduction of emissions of gases by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a standard that will be fulfilled by the country, as stated in the Press Communication of the Ministry of Environment.
The use is high on Bali - the long-term international climate policy agreement must always be concluded within two years, otherwise it would take into force safely only after 2012. In this case, the scientific climate change committee of the United Nations in the latest report of the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system.
This would delay the emission reduction, and the increase in the average earth temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army we're on YouTube
British army units have enhanced records of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan increasing popularity on the video portal.
The British Air Waffe (RAF) YouTube has discovered: Loading special units in Afghanistan since March 2006 over transactions against the Taliban, the BBC reports.
The records rotated on helms are checked at the air weapons point in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air weapons have already contributed to 139 such records, their "canal" was considered more than 75,000 times.
The British Defence Minister was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in early 2007 to make videos about Iraq and Afghanistan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace strips (MNFI) in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Employment in Afghanistan
The air weapons originally published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Defence Minister says, the contributions also serve to inform the people about the objectives of the foreign areas.
Such artified Propaganda is almost free in comparison to natural televisions, such a defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to BBC, but these videos always have a certain measure of political message in itself, since they have visited the existence of military measures taken by the Government in their own way.
Americans swimming with game
But the army must also fight against amateur records, which, besides the careful, censured records, also create in the network - such as those who show the death of the soldiers: in some of the "of" of the "propaganda" films, the most lost, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Furthermore, from the military scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos have been loaded on the platform, but the Brits have recently discovered for themselves.
Instead, the Americans throw to something different, namely with the free-downloadable shooting game "Americas Army", where the player can stick into the skin of the soldiers in a more or less lifetime simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatche in the Ministers
Work Minister Monica Lamperth is no way awesome: Instead of a Christmas Festival, she has a working conference in which their employees can be able to join coffee and pogatche in 2007.
Some ministers celebrate with live music, other supreme Christmas vote with tombola or anxieties in the officers.
Party, Christmas vote, concerts and buffet - so the power celebrates.
The Christmas Fever has already taken the officers.
The greatest Christmas Festival of the Minister is now held in defence, but the workers of the Minister are not expected.
At the Wednesday Wednesday, children are limited by fallen soldiers, where "Mission Festival" family members are assessed by stationed soldiers in the foreign country, but there is also a receipt for the press.
The restaurant provides approximately 25 million feasts.
In comparison with other resources, the National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economy and Ver­ses are deployed by the National Development Agency.
The 4.32 million Forint's Christmas Festival of the Economic Ministry will be held in the house of the future, expecting approximately 350 of the 600 employees.
The focus of the festivals is on Christmas, but there will also be living acts and a tombola release.
The National Development Agency (NFU) held its 4.7 million Forint holidays at midweek in the Court of Justice (OIT) with concerts and festivals.
The salamite was 1 million forint, which was issued for more than 400 charged guests.
According to our information, a NFU department is also invited at another Christmas Festival, which is made by the Hungarian Economic Development Area (MAG Zrt) from EU currencies.
For the festival, the building of the pleasant game theater ("Vigshínház") was mixed.
The MAG Zrt has not assessed these information because we have not reached the responsibility.
What's the point?
The OIT building was not only open to the NFU guests but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia ball on 7 December.
They did not have to have the OIT a lot for the use of spaces.
Some 500 sugars came to the ball.
The festivals were exhausted with an appointment of the Minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was divided by: there was no obligation on the ball of clothing or driving.
The Ministries of Health, Work, and self-administration are prepared for puritan feasts.
The Ministry of Health shall celebrate the feast for the workers in their four walls for approximately 400,000 forint.
Minister Monica Lamperth officially not brings its employees to a Christmas Festival, but to the Conference for the Year.
It is calculated with approximately 180 guests, which - if the press division - only with coffee and pogatche, the festival is with 350,000 forints.
Mr Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues are only in the Ministry Aula.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) shall celebrate a Christmas Festival at its own festival, at which 436 employees are expected.
The depths were measured with 2.500 Forint per head - for this money there is a buffet receipt with the following advantages.
Since the beginning of the office of Janos Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate this way each year.
However, there will not be a proper partition - not only because of the official speech of the Minister, but also because the party was appointed for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agricultural Agriculture takes a new year-old receipt this time.
The guests are requested in Schloss Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the outcome of the restaurant, the gates are measured with 1.000 Forint per guest.
As reported by the Presse Department, it will be a very simple steam-capacity to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are loaded.
The receipts that are made each year start traditionally with a short advantage of the Minister and sounds with retaining mouse.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] request, there will not be a Christmas celebration at the outside or in the Ministry of Education.
Asking on the costs of Christmas Festivals, the Press Department of the Ministry of Environment could not have been given any exemption.
In any case, more than 400 guests were loaded for the feast that were performed in the Kunstfactory Museum.
Always more powers mobilised for Riesen-Stdang
The Liga Workshops and the Hungarian Community Foderation form their coordination committee on Friday for the undetermined period starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a Protest growth assembly will be held on Monday, on the day of the national vote on the hospital insurance law.
It is calculated by strike-conditional, significant pollution barriers, since the railway traffic is almost completely set up, and the Budapests are also running up to 13 hours.
Details on the strike on Monday will be given on Friday afternoon by the Liga Companys and the Community Federing.
It is also established by a LIGA - MOSZ Streik Committee responsible for coordinating actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a Protest growth assembly will be held, and from Monday, all organizations associated with the stream will deduce the work for an undetermined time, unless there is no agreement with the Government.
In other words, the end of the vote on the day of Parliament was not determined.
If the National Council does not accept the hospital insurance law, the Associations shall return the call to stream immediately.
However, if the law is prohibited, the strike committees shall be gathered together to consult the further action.
According to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is also possible to think that it is only in the following hours, or at midnight to vote on the hospital insurance law.
The streams starting on Monday will have to be calculated with significant deficiencies: the railways lay their work for an undetermined time, the majority of the public resources are still and more than the help of the Volán-Gesellships.
At the same time, there will be many places of locking cars in a direction.
The call to strike has been followed by numerous tools and civil organizations - the list of participants is currently updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations announced strike at an undetermined time, other plans for a time-limited employment.
Until Thursday afternoon, between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the Free Association of the VDSZZZ railways could not be achieved any agreement on sufficient performances, although just about Christmas Festivals are still more people with the train.
According to previous reports, the BKV starts up to 13 hours, at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 hours early, and the LIGA tools for electricity and heat are low to work for four hours, and the teacher facility, e.g., has called the Democratic Teacher facility to 2 or 2-8 hours.
The Hungarian Physician Association is alterningly at different times, which the EDDSZ, the Democratic Society of Employment in Health and Social Affairs, a SZEF sub-organisation, the Forge for the Cooperation of Companies, remains a two-time warning period.
The most important of the four points required by the Liga is that the Government takes back the draft reform of the hospital insurance and provides a new concept for social talks.
The second request relates to the gradually introduction of the new pension-bearing model which will occur from the next year.
Requirement No 3 states that the eligible professional groups of access to the primary pension system will be allowed before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZ, which belongs to Liga, has not accepted the underlines concerned and now requires a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Garden increases State risk
According to the risk analysis Department (Risk Analysing Division) of Political Capital, the A ́ses of the "Movement for Better Hungary" founded in this August have highlighted the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
In the "Risico Warning Report" of the Institute, there is, among other things, the highest political risk of the "depreciation of the existing ethnic spending between the cigarette and the non-indicator population in Hungary, which could even lead to a short-term activity of ethnic divergence".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Garden, which probably aims at provoking such a distortion, is the research institution.
As reported, this will be considered as a derogation from the political responsible parties: "The people of the public life have left the debate of the Roman Question Representatives of radical political groups, which now have built their political positions on the Roman Hungarian position."
It is believed that this will strengthen the problem, make the reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities, and enhance the probability of violent disagreements.
The Research Institute also considers that the activities of the Hungarian Garden had, not further, thanks to the enormous attention of the home and foreign media, "the image of Hungary in the foreign, especially as regards the confidence in stability and democracy".
We remind us: Since early 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has continued to be exhausted, so since summer 2007, several organizations called "national self-defence union" have been established.
"These groups are generally defined as civil organisations, while they are open to prepare their members - including armed - defence tasks (catastrophic protection, country defence, regulatory protection), with a vocation to the unfairness of the police, the army, respectively of the State's own," he said.
And further: Everything happens in accordance with the method that is trying to do different, based on the population's and partial disturbance, political efforts as citizens' initiatives.
The emphasis of the civil character and the association is, therefore, not only the environment of legal hardships that could occur at the time of the entry to the court - it is a political situation at the same time.
As the analysis is to be taken, the activities of the Hungarian Garden also constitute a risk increase in relations with the neighborhoods.
"In the past months, the Hungarian garden was quoted as a potential source in several neighbouring countries, such as some ultranationalists of certain neighbouring countries see the activation of their own anti-Hungary policy in the development of the Hungarian Garden.
All this has effect on the political stability of the region," it said.
From the view of the research institution, the establishment of the Hungarian Garden is not a single phenomenon in Central East Europe, thus the political risk of the whole region is grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Garden are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Garde, which were established in August 2007 by the legal extrém of the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Based on the development of the Bulgarian garden, the Roma mass exhibitions found in a town quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the cases at the time of the establishment of the national garden, with the argument that the objective of the "national protection" organisation was.
Their opinion was, in the past 17 years, a regular "cigeuner terrible" in Bulgaria, but the State remained unfair and indifferent - so political Capital.
And further: The initiative would have made a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it is said, the increased risk of ethnic distortions is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own garden for resistance.
Since the A ́s of the Hungarian Garden too many similarities shown by the Bulgarian National Garde, it is not to exclude that the Hungarian Romans also respond to the threats of their own protection, it refers to the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institution.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published, and if risk changed trends were recognised, the public opinion will be informed, in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Festivals are not everywhere celebration
In Hungary, festivals are legally regulated, thus the practice of re-disponing work days has been established around the feast in the middle of time, but the next year we are protecting less than these days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood under "Firthday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state-friendly and working days.
Free working days are most of the church celebration, or are related to significant history events.
For example, we celebrate New Year: as well as the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are working-free days - the last days are only so that the silvester feasts can be exhausted.
Over the whole year, we have a total of four feasts.
The State Festival is on 15 March, referring to the revolution of 1848, and on 23 October, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, the state foundation, on 1 May, will be made to work, we will remember our dead on 1 and 2 November.
Moreover, there are two festivals at East, Pennsylvania, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious festivals often fall on a weekend, the practice of the "workday shipping" has been observed in cases where we would work only one day before or after the weekend.
The price of the long-term weekends, however, is that we have to work very well at the Sabbaths before, or have to go to school.
Where this day, which falls before or after the festival, finally shall be determined by the Minister for Affairs for years in a regulation.
The law shall apply to all employees and employees, to public employees and officers of the public service.
Except companies and entities in which the operation is continued without interruption, as well as at the festivals.
Today, the work schedule is still being made by the celebration at the end of the year: from 24 December, the life remains formal, since most of the days between Christmas and Silver are taking time balance, or the vacation that it owns.
In the next year, more holidays will fall to the weekend, or to the end of the week, so there will be less changes in work days than this year.
The calendar will first be around the day of work "placed on the head", so that people can stay at home at the same time four days.
Saturday, 26 April, will be a working day so that Friday, 2 May, may be a rest day.
The second replacement is related to the breakfast on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, you will have to work on Friday, 24 October.
However, the end of the year will remain in the sign of the festival after all remains and remains from 24 December, even if silver falls on a middle-week.
Six disturbing minorities to endanger working colleges
E-mails that we forget to scan, language news that we never receive - unfair lies that do not see us anymore: they bring "color" to the workplace every day.
The question is just whether you are used to these small inappropriaties, or if you are better faced with the challenge and are trying to avoid these incomprehensible situations consciously for other harmful situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the Marketing Department," says a colleague.
That you're disappointed by a meeting?
In the best case, it is suffering and trying to do good again by calling at the Marketing Department and being honestly forgotten to send the message (that is the less usual method).
Most of the things have been denied with a excuse.
Before we are in punishing statements, we should consider how to prepare his colleagues really unappreciated moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Something that doesn't belong to oneself?
There's a little more nervous than if you're taking a document, a office, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday, was the hall device still on the table - today it's gone early?
Or is the lost crowd writer discovered at the desktop of a colleague?
Without question, nothing should be taken from the colleagues because they will be enraged rightly if they find that something has gone away.
So, no cover or post-it from the office, because it could take one to himself: nothing more if you're driving it.
I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm aware of the fact that I'm not aware of the fact that I'm not aware of the fact that I'm not aware of the fact that I'm not aware of the fact that I'm aware of the fact that I'm
There is no effective means to keep a trail that has already been placed in the world.
Who did with whom?
Where and why?
The information (or disturbance) on the life of the colleagues should not be given to everyone at the nose!
And if someone opens and gives us his inner secret, we should not misuse this confidence!
The best thing is to be weakened as a tomb, rather than just put the presence, even if others know the problems of the colleague.
Without a reason, you reported sick?
If you call in the Office to report yourself on a challenging head pain because you just feel unfortunate, or just want to be quiet, you should be over one in clearing: the own work, unexpected performances, projects with fixed appointments, now the colleagues have to perform oneself.
So don't play the colleagues wrong!
If you know that the next day it will not be created in the office, or that something could be disappeared, why you must stay home, it should be reported timely so that neither the colleagues nor the chief will be unexpectedly confronted with the dissidence.
Family, phones, phones
You are just deep in his work, but will you suddenly be disturbed by the fairs of the colleagues?
Does there be a telephone conversation that you shouldn't have heard?
The colleagues should not be nervous with sums, songs, sound talks (which are leading over their heads), trembles, persistent shimps or nerks.
All this can be very single, even if they are not just deeply in a task (writing, planning, organising).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project doesn't have a timely end, you have forgotten to check a major letter or important messages, you should not look for the fault of your own forgottenness in others!
If possible, you should not talk to the chaos in the office or the lawyers!
The best thing is to make his mistakes, and excuse if others have been affected!
The question of how to rebuild the mistake, or how to recover the defect is too difficult!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Trainingshose and sleep: Bequem for home, but nothing has lost in the office!
You should not even be clothing so bad if it would be allowed to work!
It's not to be too sleepy - you should respect both his colleagues and yourself so much that you are clothing in the office accordingly - if you want, also beautiful and elegant!
I want to make it all right - or how to become uninterested for others
Stop and go-verge, the car in the middle of the morning.
From the radio is a rare melodia: the sound of an eye, parsed with electronic effects.
I'm rotating the volume.
The tempo changes, to the current sounds the bass comes, and as a real sound bullshit a female chor.
It's the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar, which appears to mr2.
The home musicians haven't used us for a long time with quality electrop.
But now you even see the stage different if you hear the new Zagar album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting production from the home digital underground scene, slowly involves a change in the total image, even if the garage rock with gitarrengequische is "in", the home electrop proves: There are news under the sun.
Baláz Zságer started in Pâs, musiced himself in the band Yonderboi before he - maybe because a business house doesn't get two pipes - began to describe his own way.
The interruption with project (Zagar) and his music, the elements of Jazz, electronic, and Pop smiled, but he created only before you requested to compose the sound track to a movie (e.g.
"Sezon" by Ferenc Turk.
The training that had occurred in smaller clubs was first to the larger public when the magazine "wan2" designed its first album from 2002 under the top 50 home albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, shorted nearly the only trend set in the west.
Of course, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but it didn't interest if they would like this mark too.
The band responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album currently appeared with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new ways to them, but the title is already the desire of continuity with the P-4 years.
The expression is the time when Baláz Záger was still on the way with another band.
The air-flying advice would also be okay, but near the aterical character of the music the - the magazine and the trend corresponding - la′e gitarr, the influence of Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the song of György Ligeti, who works in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", has been presented at the premium in the Millennium.
A song from the album has even created it to the radio shooter - the newest from early to late popmusic sending mr2 Pet·fi has set the auditors with the number "Wings of Love", which has been included in the collaboration of six domestic songs ("Batterground Divas"), successfully set the horrwurm.
It's all right, so (?).
The hvg.hu asked Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new Hit asks the question: How long will your music be kept in a certain shit?
Baláz Zzáger: The term "seek music" doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two boxes in the pop music, not stream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercially and honestly.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be seen and unseen, but they can be produced only for the sale that makes it commercial music.
Even a pop number can be produced from an honest motive.
The reading of the hearer also works in accordance with this principle, of languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a subdivision in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign public to your music?
B.C.: In the foreign, especially westernly, Popmusic has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenages or twens to concerts, but also the older public.
They follow the trends in the pop music that around them, much more attentionful, because they also view them as part of the modern culture.
hvg.hu: What role comes to the public at the work?
Is it important, who, where, how many people hear your music?
B. Z.: Of course, it's a feeling of seeing that more comes to our concerts.
But we have never composed for the market.
The music is not for us to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the public is mostly detectable in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but it is only in the inaccessible changes of the moment.
Yet, I'm not sure that if you want to do it all right, you're not interested anymore.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's as a solist on the road and has built his car more in the west.
B. Z.: We don't really go his way, but all the time we're trying again to interpret this in our music.
We'll be seen as a teamplayer who trusts the musical presence of the other and allows them to be disappointed.
In the beginning, comparisons of our work with Yonderboi were incredible, since many of us came from his band and made another way.
hvg.hu: In the Charts of mr2 Pet ·fi "Wings of Love" is first.
The name Zagar has only been heard in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a little more else style in the direction of a widespread public conscious?
B. Z.: We had no plans to write a heat that would then be held as a trained horse for the album.
It's more about this song.
It was thought to be the final of the album, with which we wanted to resolve the sounding and the more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why just she, what was the leader Prince?
B. Z.: The basic thought was to make a Gospel-artist Chor.
Then the idea came to compose the Chor from the begotten solists of the home musicians.
This is how the six-cooked Chor has occurred - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enik′ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth - which we then have been baptized more "Batterground Divas".
hvg.hu: Would you like to have the song exactly, or did the girls make it?
B. Z.: The number was already in the instrumental version, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number was still "worrying something".
The academic arrangement has formally requested a vote.
I've entered the melodie the same night, and later they've learned the girls.
Everything came practically on Anhieb and horrible spontaneous.
I can remember that I was pretty electricized at that time, but it has already needed the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: So on the plate, as well as on the concert, you had the impression that the girls would be in the background.
There is no Solo-Part (depending on the short Solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, singing perfectly together, and they are not la• as music, so they are not only accompanied by music.
They also stood behind the stage.
Is it an intention?
B.Z.: The fact that they have standed behind was that because of clean technical problems.
However, we would not be conscious to allow them sole roles.
In the number, it is also because you have to forget his ego a little, forget who comes from where and where he is, let us simply let these certain wings, the wings of love, become to us.
I would like to see others also this euphorical state that we have seen when the song has occurred.
hvg.hu: What was the most outside song?
B.C.: Nothing in the musical creation work has been given more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I played on a concert keyboard, or at "Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove wouldn't work any longer, but after and after, everything went together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Z.: This changes with the concerts and now, where I have the album "lossed".
Currently, "Prophet is A Fool", "Escape From the Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Injury maker risked for billion billion feelings of minority
Foodless Manufacturer
Thus, his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French Bankenriese Societé General, owner of the existing commercial bank.
She was about about five billion euros because of her.
But it seems to be that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do his colleagues equally, it was certainly not able to do it.
In order to subscribe to all large banking houses, he at the time recognized the crisis of the Ananian hypothecs.
"He's psychically weaker," he was to hear from the mouth of his representative who showed him at the police.
However, as the expressions of Kerviel, published by the French media, such as the Daily Journal Le Monde,, he was a man who had achieved the end of the last year with his business profits of 1.6 billion euros.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to deserve for my bank money," he claimed in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to deserve a half billion euros just in the crisis.
The opportunity is that he had already seen at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already the first news that the so-called sub-Prime hypothics, such as income weak customers or those who had previous payment problems, would be in difficulties.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe that and kept right.
At the end of the year, he had exhausted his winning up to 1.6 billion euros.
"When I had deserved the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Karviel adds and continues to say that he definitely had nothing to keep for himself.
With the whole hearing, he admits that he has records so that you don't want him to be able.
He even was able to lead his boss behind the light, even though the Eurex bars were interested in his business.
risk benefit
Did he promise to stop?
Oh, no, no.
"I thought she was satisfied with the fair fact that I deserved 1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to make his position gradually.
He entered the Société General in 2000, immediately after he had finished his room at the University of Lyon.
His annual amount was about 51,000.
After two years, he was a Maker assistant and in 2005 he became a self-maker with a 90000-year-old amount.
Yet, he knew he would never deserve so much as others.
"In my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was observed.
Because of my training and also because of my fair and personal development," Kerviel explained to the research officer.
But soon after the entrance, the first great success arrived.
With the acts of the Alliance, he deserved much by putting half billion euros on the course loss of this title in London's bomb attacks.
And that was the soldier - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, let's let you go.
"It's like a snowball," he said to the cops.
But the chiefs were able to know about everything, relatively.
"When I deserved money, the eyes were cut."
But then, at the beginning of this year, the big shock came.
On one day, he lost a billion euros.
At a weekend mid January, he wanted to compensate it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer employee of the Bank.
And a few days later, the Bank announced that she had lost five billion euros for her.
And how did they come to him?
He was suspected by a vacation.
"I took only four days from the previous year.
A maker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to look at him in the cards," Kerviel finally said.
Czechland has the opportunity to come to 365 billion
The Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission have been subject to nine developing programmes that can bring the Czech Republic to 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the next years.
This is about the half of the sums that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies are able to get about 100 billion crowns from the "Entity and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flee into the building.
The development programme is the largest development programme and includes up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money will increase by the budget of the State Infrastructure Fund, which will be over 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme will provide firms and companies to gain funds for innovative enterprises.
This means that companies will win funds for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
Czechland, among the new accession countries, belongs to the lower than before.
The Nicaraguan Court shall appoint twenty-year prison penalty for presidents
A professional court in Nicaragua visited on Thursday the twenty-year arrest penalty for the former President Arnold German, which was condemned in 2003 for financial deficiency of 100 million (approximately 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived on his hazienda at the Nicaragua Metropole.
Whether the former government overseer (1997 to 2002) of this Central American State returns to the grid, the news agency AP says that it is not clear.
According to the president of the Court of Procedure, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officers, whether Germany will leave his penalty home or whether he should be in prison.
A court indicated four years ago that Germany had regularly moved the government's money on accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were physical and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest associates.
Some of these money landed in a fund that Germany had established for the financing of his election battle in 2001.
The budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The State budget is approved.
What is the case with this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has decided and which has been adopted without support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The CSSD (Social Democrats) was yet approved for the current year because the Minister Sobotka (of this party) had submitted it, and the CSSD could not have been allowed to reject it.
In the subsequence of the vital debate before voting on the disbelieving request against the Government this time, nothing was dramatic.
The House of Deputy was traditionally a little worth of this, but the highest significant law in every rest.
This is a certain paradox.
It begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether or not.
The budget is a major part of the , but it is covered by the Government's powers and opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they give him more attention.
A fighting is much more interesting for the public than nearest numbers.
The State budgets are subject to three deficiencies in the past social democratic governments which the budget for 2008 cannot be removed at once:
The first is the high share of the provisions committed by law, not only to pensions, but also to social expenditures that have been determined by the "speaking" coalition of the CHSSD and KSČM (communicators) last year before the elections.
The second is the deteriorated budget policy as the result of the first weakness point.
The limitation consists of the depths of public funds, i.e. the budget of the communities.
However, the largest risk is not the State budget deal.
This budget is public and sometimes under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget depth of the communities.
Citizens have given additional sources of investment to exclude income from taxes, taxes and bank credits, often deserving unforeseen debts by which they debt their advisory houses in excess.
In the past years, they have been able to pay these debts through a massive sale of shares of energy and other supply networks that they received in the movement of the Implementation of the State.
Now this source is already defeated.
As we keep ourselves on official and testable facts, we make sure that:
Our economy has been running a growth phase since a few years, like the world, which the CSSD has praised without submission.
This constituted a single opportunity for their governments to correct public funds.
Instead, however, these governments debt the State more.
Other countries, except some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have economyed much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a ridicule that is primarily to write to the former governments.
We belong to the countries threatened at least to poverty.
That is why no massive social programmes have been needed, unfortunately, in the past years overwhelmed in a huge dimension.
Even if we have been able to stop a part of the populations that have been forbidden this year before the elections, it is clear that if it comes not to a movement of the rental age and to a pension reform, then it ends practically everyone in this country, and, exactly who is powerful, it will not remain to him as a clean administrator.
It is only easy to overcome if you say that they will be officials of government who share the largest part of tax income mechanically on pensions and social expenditures.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but it can only include the deterioration of normal costs through obligation expenditure.
The depth of 70 billion crowns for 2008 would certainly be overflow if former governments had not issued what happened in the last years.
If we don't really want to be pure of government officers, we must be patient and not too strong coalition government, but it is aware that the State can only exhibit so much as it is able to remain in taxes and taxes to want rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to commit crisis
The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on the financial markets.
Thus, more than 100 billion will be achieved through auctions on the markets.
These audits increase the rate of rate to which they are ready to provide mutual money.
For example, the Federal Feder sends 40 billion to auktion, 24 more makes it locker for the European and the Swiss Central Bank.
According to the proposals of 11 September, the central banks of the individual States are the first time to take place in such a coordinated procedure in respect of the deduction of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step will remove the largest difficulties of the economy, so the remaining lack of free capital that the banks can provide," wrote in a report to his customers Bernard Baumohl from the Economic Outlook Group's Advisory Form.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States of 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in the report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion, especially in the United States.
Analysers expect more billion losses.
"The central banks must have actually had had before, what can be done when they have taken the leadership of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies, said.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks are concerned that if the banks themselves have difficult access to, they will also be decreased for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and decrease the economy into a recession, possibly with impact on economic growth worldwide.
The central banks have decided after they were not able to decrease the LIBOR, even the London Interbank Tax, which will be used for the delivery of money between banks.
This means that the banks had continued to spend each other's money, and that, despite the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom's central banks had decreased their price rates several times during the inheritance.
"This will have the same effect as a further decrease of the rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Agency Reë.
Some analyses believe that this stage of central banks contributes to the rise of the crisis because it is not the fundamental problem, even the case of immobility in the United States.
Klaus: Ecological debates are incredible
Global climate changes are most harmful for developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed the problem of global heating.
The criticism was now addressed to the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change on Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, No Green Planet", he concluded that the ecological debates were incredible.
The claus states that not only the structure of the conference is inacceptable, which constitutes a rare mixture of government representatives and such non-governmental organizations, but also the basic subdivision between the ritual which they associate and the reality.
"The debate in there is unstructured, it is a word firework, which is only a replacement for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech Chairman stressed the presentation of his book that his subject is very important for him, and that he is so involved in it.
He also expresses his satisfaction in the fact that his book appears in German translation because "I often meet the carrier of my opinions."
Now the interesters could read his attitude uninterruptedly.
Klaus reminded that he was not a climate, but he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He is academic, capable of understanding and evaluating practical negotiations, has experience with statistics and is also a national economy.
As the main statement of the book, he emphasized that the climate continues to change and that its changes are, therefore, normal that there is no coherent opinion between the societies that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and serious and thus no threat, and that the efforts to influence climate development are overwhelmed, uneffective and inacceptable.
Furthermore, he views it as a person who has experiences with totalitary systems to force other unproofed views to it as an annual restriction to freedom.
He repeatedly explained that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against military eco-activists, who do not take into account the relationship between intervention and deal."
The same topic in Vienna had spoken in the Hayek Institute two months ago.
600000 people couldn't change their leadership
600000 car drivers delayed the time to change their old leadership, which is the end of the year.
Today, it is the last day where you can turn the exchange to the authorities to set up a new leader sign until the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not threaten that hundreds of thousands of carriers be taken on the roads after the new year without valid driving authorisation.
According to the authorities, those who have no longer wanted to carry out their leader appearance have not changed their headquarters.
When small places report a strong decline of the interest of the leader's exchange, the main town's officers are overflowed with requests, and the interest in exchange has grown this week.
The city manager is running around 2000 customers daily.
You have to stand a half hour.
In Prague, approximately 140000 car drivers have not converted their leadership yet.
The exhibition of a new leader is 20 days.
But it is possible to advance the exhibition with a decreased period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Car carriers who do not create the previously written exchange until the end of the year and who take away without a valid guideline shall threaten money penalty from January.
The wrong-doer pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
The police may, however, be allowed to apply it with a reminder in the case of the offence.
In the case of an offence, the penalty may increase to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the community may also be punished that does not carry.
He could, so it said, threatened a penalty of even 30000 crowns.
The Ministry has already invited the officers to leave mild and to put up a penalty of 1000 crowns.
According to Karel Hanzelka, the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but no one threatens a thousand crowns.
The leader appears to be a document where each can decide whether or not.
It is not a personal evidence that everyone, even if a valid, needs to be.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give their leader.
It is worth bringing him to the competent community office or sending him by recording Dorthin.
At the end of the year, leaders will not be valid issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, the car cars need to exchange other types of leaders.
People with leaders from 1994 to 2000 have three years of time for the exchange.
The validity of leaders issued by 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other leaders.
The Court sent down penalties for detectives associated with Berdych
The former cops Joseph Opava and Petr Koňarek, who were accused of having made a joint thing with the bands of David Berdych, received 13 relatively 10 years of prison.
This dismissed the Prager Supreme Court, which reduced its penalty for a period of two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Agency for the Battle against the organized crime" threatened 14 years or 12 years.
There is no possibility of vocational opportunity against today's judgment, only a revision is possible in the Court of Justice.
Berdych himself is also accused of this matter, but it is the first sentence.
In other processes, however, he had already been punished for 16 years.
Moreover, he can't be condemned.
In January 19, a Court of Auditors was particularly guilty of the participation of a rubbish accident, and the Supreme Court negotiated the vocation of 16 of them today.
The majority of the accused ones were from the beginning to complaints with the reasoning, it was a constructed case.
According to the Mediterranean District Court, Police members of the Court of Justice transferred information from the sources of the police, covered various divisions and helped members of the band to dismiss the penalty.
The bands left Opava and Koňarik 30 Pro of the beute.
In the case of the complaint, it is crimes of the bands from 1999 to 2001.
In addition to raw accidents whose victims often suffer serious damage, but also official measurement and inappropriate weapons.
At home investigations, the police found illegal guns, munition with steel brains, a laser target moon and a machine pistle.
The bands, according to the accusation, have been decreased by their raw events about a lot of million crowns.
Besides, nearly 20 men in this procedure recognized Judges Berdych and a number of others because of other raw accidents were legally guilty.
Other men from Berdych's surrounding must be responsible in another process, other cases have not yet been reached before the court.
The main negotiation has so far been to Tomáš Pota and Maroš Schulej, who are in the Irish prison, waiting for the final decision on their delivery of criminal persecution in the Czech Republic.
Children missing - account: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a disconnection clinic, the lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in Trébič 12 million crowns will require compensation and court costs.
For each of the mothers per three million, for the fathers per two million, and for the children ever one million.
The hospital offers maximum 200000 for each parent.
The Legal Representative of the Hospital, Ondréj Dostál, is therefore totally incompatible with Veleba's proposal.
"That is a proposal that we refuse that he is too simple," Dostal said after today's negotiation.
"In order to make us a view of this opposite proposal, we need the opinion that has made the opposite.
We will find out whether it has a total value of expression.
But we believe that this should be together in the hundreds of thousands," Dostal stressed.
The amount should be moved between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for each month that she did not open her biological daughter.
For Veleba, as a basis for deficiency negotiations, it was an opinion that had taken for him the University Hospital in Prag Motol.
Parents of the children have experienced psychology and psychiatric damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men were better disturbing the stress situation, even if they had seen prejudices, they could have prevented the change of the newborn.
The women return with the effects of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is currently happening, Veleba fascinated the content.
Veronica and Nikola expired the past 9 December of the hospitals of the disconnection clinic in Träbič.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Chermaks in Pribysla, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova to Jabloňov.
The head of the Vysočina (Bohmisch-Marerical Height) of the vicinity of each family overlooked 100000 crowns as a substitution for the depths that occurred to them by the mistake of the hospital in Träbič, which is under the district.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are insured by law due to obligation.
In the case of doubts, they must take a reserve fund, except if they are able to assist the trainer.
The courts have equivalently decreased lower damage amounts, which were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Polivka came about his Kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the fight about the mark "Reign of Walachei".
According to the Court of Justice in Ostrava, he first used the name "Walachi King", but the project had built a team for Tomáš Harabish in collaboration with the shower in a long-term work.
Polívka did not participate in the negotiation today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not finished, and his man will probably call on.
"The fight is that Mr. Harabish and his team want to share parasitally in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas," after the negotiation of Polívkas lawyer said.
All of them appeared in the words "Walachic Kingdom" just to these players and comicers.
The same opinion is also Harabish.
"We have almost a yearly job behind us.
Finance acquisition and concepts of the A's," he said.
According to him, the fight for money is an opportunity.
"In years, they have noticed that the project is and that they may have something of it.
They want to win parasits in our work," he continued.
Business
According to the Court, Polívka used the name "Walachi King" for the first time in one of his television sentences.
1993, the viewer Radoslav Brzobohati crowned him.
However, this was not in that time with the intention of establishing a ficticial kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came to the idea of giving a wallish pass.
From an originally funeral crisis, a business and an undertaking A's outcome, then the Harabish's establishment of the "Walachish Kingdom" company.
1997 Polívka agreed on the use of his name and his signature in the passports and even offered its owners reducements in the processing of his farm and theater views.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also pointed out that Harabish only used the only idea that the Polívka had published in the "Manege" sending for his business purposes.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Wales Kingdom," said the judge.
However, they added that the soul of the Harabish project and his team would have been intensely dedicated to him.
The cooperation of today's disrupted parties lasts until 2000, when Harabish for Polívka in Vsetin organized the official crowning.
Since then, Polívka and Harabish began to argue the conflicts in the subscription "King Boleslavs I. chosen until the day of Sankt-Nimmerleins".
The leader's role then took advice to Harabish Jarmila Shuláková as the queen's mother.
Then 2002, Polívka against Harabish and his company introduced the complaint that the Court has rejected today.
Clearness in the fight could bring the wet battle prepared by Harabish around the throne and a half princess.
This should be a new king.
He did not want to deliver details and a date yet.
"We don't want to overcome anything.
It should be something like the king's summer tower in the Walachei.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr Polívka is also able to be able to join it well," added Harabish.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudice
To say the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
His vehicle properties were not very valuable, the quality of the combination, the alignment and also the processing could be higher than average.
But now his follower, Peugeot 207, on the market, and he is about much better.
The combi with the SW name is another piece, and I'm just staying to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic ha'back of 207, for example, I had to complain about the too small headfreeness on the backsides.
These complaints are no longer available, because the carossery of the combi is so made that even two-meter men will not suffer.
Next
I'm just going through the internal equipment so that I can't repeat too much.
It's a quite adequate design, where I'm only on account of the careful median tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more designer design, where the car makes a more elegant impression.
The seats are bequem, and the times are over where we may be disappointing ourselves about too short sitting or heading.
The content of the page has also improved significantly towards 206.
As regards the room offer, you can also see the increased measurements of the caroserie.
In the combi, the lack of head freedom is also removed.
Coffee in the kitchen room
But the main thing on this car is the lader room.
I have to view it as a very well loadable and guardable (a.k.a. because of the expansive backsheet).
The hall rooms are equipped with guards that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not sing, let each other move and keep the more difficult items.
But we're talking about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic expenditure, 428 litres, which is a higher average value in comparison to competition.
However, not in comparison with the most recycled vehicle in Czech Republic, the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains clearly estimated 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a foreign accommodation or when a child car is invited.
But to highlight the positive, I still need to admire the very flat lader space, or the very low ladecent.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a Vierrilinder benzin engine with Hubraum 1,6 litres and a performance of 88 kWp.
And honestly, this should look like a 1600-cubic engine, who has a family-hatchback.
He's quiet, he has a small consumption, and he's gone well.
If I compare him with an opposite in Schoda, which sometimes acts as if his exhaust was hidden with a lap, I can only be disappointed by him.
The price list speaks bands
The price of this car is not just national.
But we must remember that we have tested a well equipped car with a spacious inside and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400th benzin engine is 329900 crowns.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already a lot.
The premium of the test car is replaced by 80000 crowns in the books.
However, we had headfair bathrooms, automatic climate installation, automatic shipping shipping solution, electric window pipe back and...
Thus, the car totally costs 531900 crowns.
This is a lot, but once calculate the additional equipment of a fabian together and you will reach a very similar sum.
So there is only the decision you want to choose.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is not possible
In British schools, the number of children from East European countries increases, which calls for the domestic age to continue the development of local school.
The integration of the Eastern Europes is still a series of obstacles.
British schools even determine cases where conflicts between the immigrants and the children of the original residents of violence become.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British Schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the interactions between the inhabitants and the Slovak migrators are increasingly increased.
Stress, shoes, and reigns among students are over the relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham took a Slovak woman who had struck a year old boy with a iron stage.
The accused one defended himself that the boy had promoted her with racism emphasis.
The police also had to attack a Slovakian immigrant after an attack of two minor girls.
The girls had made racial comments against the man and made him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy shot on a bushouse and shot on us.
When I told him he was to stop, he washed us with eggs and birds and then disappointed his seat," described a mother of Slovak students of the magazine The Times another unappreciated incident.
Consequences come from both sides.
One of the inhabitants even covered the fight against the immigrants in Eastern Europe as a survival camp.
The cases mentioned show that the vote between inhabitants and immigrants at British schools is always more stressed.
In Britain, 70000 Slovaks were reported here to work.
So approximately 30000 Slovak students visit British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
It is actually an island of freedom for survivors.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will be fulfilled if you only choose the right.
Golden and white streams, high whales or a sea, which is lowly like a thick.
Palms and All Inclusive with cells that offer pizza, iron and cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the Caribbean Islands, you can find this in adequate measure.
Only on one island, however, you find much more, and this island is Cuba, the biggest and beautifulst of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their base for America's recovery.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place he ever saw a human eye.
Havanna was once to a camp or a cross-border of ships that the Spanish had dropped into America and then transported to Europe.
And then the epoch came.
The National Hotel was completely found at the end of the 20th century.
Building was one of the heads of the Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything in the U.S. felt as a crime (before during the prohibition) was likely seen and supported on Cuba - . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . prostitu . prostitu . prostitu .
Under his guests, they were in the middle of the world.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, high houses were grown, over the wide boulevards, cars that counted to the culture symbols of the fifty years of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a presence in San Francisco de Paula, near Havannas, and in Coyemar he had his jact.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of the show business and more from all America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of Havanna's Bodeguita, you can also leave your autogram.
At the bar in the National Hotel, you meet Cocktails completely for you.
And the cars of the five circles are running around in Havanna until today, because the once imported cigarettes and fiats in the salt and swimming air have fallen longer.
Mag Havanna, particularly his oldest part, has been strongly disappeared, nothing can be found in the surrounding area as many wonderful colonial spectacles as right here.
Other places are just outputed, for example Trinidad.
As the tourism offers the needed money, there was green light for this development.
In the past five years, new hotels have occurred not only in Havanna, but also in Varadero, in the coast of Holguin, as well as in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Kuba offers another marotte that is unique in the world and is particularly related to railway lovers.
Sugar roof from remote plants contained damp and the same sugar trailers to the sugar manufactures.
Its car park has not been renewed over years, and there are pussy and full-functioning lokomotives whose elderly companions are in the museum.
Flight goals
The most significant places do not allow the majority of cubas.
You should not write any more about Varadero or Havanna.
Bleve just note that there is a Museum in Hemingways' presentation, which should not be allowed by the writer to escape.
The viñales number in the west of the island is one of the most painting angles of Cuba.
The splendid vegetation w's on the colk ground.
The mogotes, calkhouts and figs, arose steel from the valley, gathered fruitful grounds in their hole rooms, which also covered rock areas of thick beauty.
This valley is where the best cuban tabac may be built.
In his final form you can meet him when you visit one of the havanna cigarettes.
It may also appear to be interesting that there has been rotated the Chilean follow-up of the "Major Zeman" television series.
Trinidad
A ural city, which shortly after the Spanish had colonized the island, was founded.
Reality and richness made her trade with slaves and sugar.
The riches were covered in the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French sediers, has not changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray village, is so distant that there was no road that would have been connected to the rest of the country in the fifty years of the past century.
This isolation contributed to remaining unrealistic.
Nothing was built there, but there was nothing broken, everyone was glad that he had a cup over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it will be rewarded to see interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the "number of sugar manufactures".
On the evening, then, you should go to Casa de la Musica, who is in the darkness, and where the music is not weakening until the morning.
Baracoa
This town in the east Cuba is some of the most beautiful in the island.
This view will certainly also be affected by the way of Dorthin.
Both streets leading from Guantánamo therein must overcome high and surrounded mountains and run through a landscape that is not affected by human attacks.
This spectacular presentation of Cuba took up UNESCO thanks to the neighborly uninterrupted nature in its world heritage list.
There is the best chocolate produced in the church, showing the Columbus cross (in fact, it was about 100 years after Columbus’s trains) and from the hill where the former village, the current hotel El Castillo, is to see several table mountains from which El Yunque is the most.
About the coffee, the room, the cigarettes, the Sierra-Maestra City, the Sweet Book and the island Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabarett, the sanctuary of the Cuban Patronin Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, a African religion to which the tribes of slaves are recognised, could be written over all of this.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Associates in Afghanistan are asserted Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of needed equipment affect the United States, according to the time of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO should, according to the words of Defence Minister Robert Gates, develop a specific plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not follow their opinions, but the representatives of the countries who have stationed units in the South of Edinburgh agreed to it.
In addition to the growing opposite of the Taliban sides, the eight participating States discuss further coordination plans among the United States.
When the United States called the NATO units to more A by their Defence Minister Robert Gates, British Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghanistan Government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, a pre-development is likely, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start the economic and security development," says the British Defense Minister of Browne of the BBC.
Neunzig Pro
The A° of the Afghanistan residents has reached the maximum state for five years, according to the information of the Army.
The number of violences was compared to the previous year by 27 Pro, even by 60 Pro in the southern province Helmand.
The NATO countries have stationed approximately 40000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about one quarter in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the units have been put to an absolute border in relation to the organisation and equipment of units.
In particular, they call for additional clusters, soldiers and experts to train Afghanistan units.
"We will have to consider the specific objectives for the next time and the way we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly, today the Secretary-General of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop.
"I am not pleased with what we have in Afghanistan to countries and air.
We have approximately ninety of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," De Hoop of the Agency Reë's said to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese Government in Tokyo.
Who's Awaitable
In the past months, among the shared countries, there is also a dispute on whether all of the United States in Afghanistan are given their own.
For example, because of passiveness, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous representatives in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and lateral part of the country," Gates said.
This week the British Boulevard magazine "Sun" approved the German soldiers as a foolball.
"Afghanian non-shore discovers: The Germans make games while our boys were fighting," the "Sun" wrote in a contribution that was completed by photos of German soldiers playing tissue.
The German picture journal passed over to the contrary and printed a picture of a British unit in a Rugby fight in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debts will be accelerated to a billion in 2009
On each Czech, a State debt of 84,000 crowns.
The total debt increased to 842,7 billion crowns until the end of September.
The government planned to debt himself this year with 159,2 billion women.
However, in the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,8 billion.
The State debts of the Czech Republic increased to 842,7 billion crowns until the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they've been thinking about 13,4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance, thus, consulted its information on the state debt from beginning October.
On each Czech, a debt of 84,000 crowns is due.
Over the past year, the state debt over 111 billion crowns.
"Is it now apparent that thanks to the lower depth for the next year, we may be exceeded the limit of a billion crowns only in 2009.
Next year the debts should be moved between 900 billion and a billion crown," said David Marek, an analytical of Patria Finance, to the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, analyzer of the Next Finance: "To overcome a billion, we could come during 2009.
When exactly, it depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it should be shown that the situation is changed at the political stage and the more will be ready to save more, it could take up until 2010.
But I don't get out of such a change," he noticed.
Debts grow
The State's debt addresses the debt of the government and is, in particular, from the adoption of the debtors of the State budget.
The State debt shall be financed by tax instructions, state debt debts, direct loans or for example by the European Investment Bank.
The inland state debt increased in the meantime of this year to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's foreign debts increased by 1,7 billion crowns to 123,3 billion.
The so-called stateable debt has reached the end of September 803,3 billion crowns and has fallen at 13,7 billion from June.
The average casuality of State debts increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased over the year from the first to the first quarter by 13 Pro, which is actually much in view of how good it is to the economy.
It is interesting that the growth is especially in the debt records, where the growth is 20%.
It's bad that the debts grow, but on the other hand, this shows that you can take something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and trade with state debts for 2007 highlights that the Government had planned for this year to become 159,2 billion crowns.
In the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,8 billion crowns thanks to the improved development of the State budget policy.
This amount is particularly affected by the State budget, which is obvious of 76 billion crowns this year in place of 91.3 billion.
In addition, it is the maximum planned funds for the consolidation agency of 13,3 billion crowns, a tenth reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of State debts for 43 billion and rates for investments in the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
Because she has given a name to a tea carrier, she has been sent to a court in Khartum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher who was accused of islam's advocate was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartum to 15 days arrest and afterward exhibition.
The British was accused to have allowed six-to-seven years old students to give the name of the tea bearer Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic Prophet has been ignored.
She would have deserved to be exhausted.
After the parents of students had been complained several times in the Southern Cultural Ministry, the 54-year basic teacher, employed at the University High School of Khartum, was attacked at home on Sunday and accused by article 125 of the Sudanese Penalty Book of Islam's Policy.
In fact, this issue takes its start in September when the teacher invites her six-to-seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classant.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school leader Robert Boules.
When the class votes, 20 of 23 children Mohammed chooses as the most loved prenames.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but especially a very common prename in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the picture signature My name is Mohammed .
The burden itself did not carry a shield with this name, but the problem is very simple that the representation of the Islamic Prophet is considered as a facilitation of Islam.
One of the Moslem colleagues of Gijahan Gibbons, who teached in the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew them well, and she had never done anything that could draw close to a religious faith, I only suffer that she asked the children to vote for a name, his view is only an innocent error.
A view that many teachers share, which are very carefully described to their students and as a person who never speaks in the class about religion.
Remember that the prename Mohammed is at the same time the second most common name given in Britain, for which 14 different writings exist in English.
This often prename selected by Moslem families is used as a kind of honor for the prophets (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But how are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you, for example, give it a game?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
In the midweek, at the last negotiation meeting in Vienna, there was no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbians and Albanians from Kosovo have completed a sixth and last debate session in the midst of the morning in Baden, Austria, without overcoming their conflicts about the future status of the separatist province.
It is sad that the parties were not able to agree with the status , explained the Middle Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Remarking that the peace in the region stands on the game, Frank Wilsner and Pristina requested his opposite, and Pristina, to comply with their commitments to maintain peace, and to continue the discussions on the end of the negotiations.
There will be no violents expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time , he added and said that there are clear spendings.
End of the sentences on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, who join the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province of Albanian speakers, 90%, could be clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko introduced their report to the United Nations Security Council until 10 December.
The discussions of Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last negotiation session since August last of the Troika, from the United Nations had received the mandate for a new mission.
The Americans and Europeans consider the end of their mission on 10 December.
The Russians who have already blocked the authorisation of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council are outside the continuation of negotiations on this end date.
Russia was and remained speaker of a negotiated solution, a comprehensive solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral independence clothes?
After Kosovo has been under UN administration for eight years, the Western countries have regarded the EU's independence for the only solution to the future.
Pristina is ready to announce them on the side if the Security Council should not decide for their benefits.
Road consists of stronger autonomy
Perhaps no agreement could be met , the President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fat日 Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations were conducted since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Cosovarian Rebellion and the future Prime Minister of the province, shared his deceases.
However , he concludes that the plan proposed by the board on the autonomy of a past which led to murder and deport .
Panel Effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic, on his side, believed that a compromise was always to strive, and the Albanian majority of Kosovo warned against the consequences of an unilateral independence claim of the province.
Rad believes that it is particularly a "domino-effect" in a region that is still so deceived by the wars of independence in the 90s.
For Serbia, that doesn't mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Wednesday, the Serbian delegation concluded that each decision would be taken into the Security Council only and only where its Russian associates had a veto right.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
Only a decision from the series of Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, explained the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations have endured two years.
You must end as they started: in the Security Council.
The journalist said that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word concerning the status and that each single independence statement would be expired from the sides of the Albanian people in accordance with the western countries.
Bush has an agreement between Israel and Palestinians
In the process of the International Peace Conference, which had been gathered on Saturday under its leading in Maryland, President Bush announced that Israel and Palestinians had finally agreed to a common claim.
He further explained that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas would have agreed to start with negotiations immediately to find an end of 60-year-old conflict between their two peoples.
In the context of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a peace agreement before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must decrease the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must set up its colonizing work, Bush explained, noting the two parties to their commitments in respect of the plan of peace, which this 2003 had agreed.
The Chairman of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities at the last time pursued a peace contract that would be made clear to all open issues without exception and to the central issues .
This name includes the three serious problems to turn the fights between Israel and the Palestinians mainly: the future borders of Palestinian, the status of Jerusalem and the ships of Arab refugees who were destroyed from their homes in today's state of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
After the president of the Ananias, Abbas adopted the word and said that the coming negotiations were completely and fundamentally conducted and provided a schedule for all points, including Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert accepted the word, he committed himself to direct and without interruption the coming weapons authorisation negotiations and to enable them to be completed before the end of 2008.
Bush has determined the period for the implementation of his vision of two states, a Palestinian and a Israelian standing close to each other for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has shown that Bush has received a assurance in this sense of Bush before it decided to join the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Polis is a great success for Washington, has led a plan adopted by all Arab countries to the ways that Israel offers peace, in exchange with its return from all Arab regions occupied during the war of 1967, in East Jerusalem.
Polis represents a separate path in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central viewpoints , the Saudi-Arabic prince refers to the interview with the Arab daybook financed by Saudi money.
According to the State advocate, the police are not responsible
What exactly is done on Sunday?
As always in this type of local news, official versions and furniture are confronted.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations of the National Disciplinary Police (IGPN), a police car on the Rue Louise-Michel direction of Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours.
He had no use, but he was on the street, and walked with 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explained a police speaker.
A green motorrad of the mark Kawasaki, without authorization, so not released for the public road transport (see below), came, driven by two youths without helm, with very high speed.
It broke the left side of the police car after it missed its leader from right, a policeman continued to explain.
The alcohol controls carried out in the vehicle passengers are very negative.
The state of the car (splittered cotton flights, split wind protection ships, scratched stone) results from the height of the spring.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the State advocate of the Republic de Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that IGPN had announced an investigation of "the facts of the unnecessary person murder and the deficiency of aid to persons" in accordance with the main reversion guide for public security of Val-d'Oise.
On the afternoon, at the time of a press conference, the State adviser declared that it excluded the IGPN's responsibility in this stage.
According to Magistratin, three witnesses of the accident, which were heard Sunday evening, have visited the version of the police, namely that this little power road has reached relatively quickly to their left side.
Yesterday, a sort of rillen, sure caused by the riding of the footroots on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained stuck up until the police were able to breathe.
The vehicles have been arrested and will be subject to technical appreciation.
The name of the two victims was obduction yesterday.
What happened after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, the police had quickly left the accident, and that, without providing the two youth help.
Although the IGPN remains fully careful, it would also exclude any serious error.
According to a police source, this is a weak aspect of the investigations needed for further investigations, and it is necessary to take care of it.
Liberation has reached a witness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had direct view of the scene.
We went out with my cousin, the sister in the hospital, immediately to try to live again, told this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed cop.
Two more tried to resume one of the youths who phoned the fourth.
In view of the spending that was quickly drawn around the event and, as it seems, because of the certainty of the people present about the unexpected situation of the youths, the police were taken into the car.
According to this witness statement, the salvation forces met nearly twenty minutes after the police went out.
You have also used heart masses, but forgiving.
I will not be allowed to say that the police officers would have not helped young people.
These youths have been the first help.
The firewall has come right now.
It was done all to try to save them, and the state advocate submitted to them.
In Pakistan, the effort is increased
On Monday, the Pakistanian police has decreased the first demonstration, since two days ago, General Musharraf has been called for the disaster.
According to the statements of witnesses in Lahore in east of the country, some 2,000 advocates demonstrated against the measures in the context of the need were hurt by the train gas granates that used the order forces there.
They threw down with stones that hurt the cops.
At least 350 advocates were temporarily fixed.
Similar scenarios were found in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and hurted advocates.
Many would have been temporarily adopted.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Advocate of the Supreme Court of Justice have invited a general time and demonstrated, as a result of a whale of some 500 arrests of oppositional, criminals of human rights and advocates during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Master Court were locked to prevent the congregation.
Other demonstrations would have found place in Multan (Mitte) and Peshawar (Nordosten).
The advocate movement received the support of the religious parties associated with Muttahida-e-Amal in the powerful covenant, whose president invited the people to send the judges who had disputed against the necessity, and those who had sent an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Justice of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
He had to refer to the legality of President Musharrafs in a position in direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was revoked and revoked to his office.
All that we represent is illegal, anticonstitutional and otherwise to the decisions of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Magister Council of The News.
Pervez Musharrafs Promised to grant the overcome of the Army and to become a civil president from the call of the need, stated on Monday the Vice-Ministry for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would deliver his military uniform until 15 November, the date at which his first office ends as President.
The Vice Minister for Information has also assessed that the elections could be moved from January.
The Pacific Government dementioned the decreased statement that the president Musharraf would have assigned a residence place by representatives of the soldiers.
There is still more than one third of pregnancy planned
This behaviour takes into account the unexpected pregnancy (24%), as well as the bad planned or unpredicted birth.
More than today, 40 years after the adoption of the New Verth legislation, which allowed receipt prevention in France, one of three pregnancy (36%) is not scheduled, as indicated by a national demographic Institute (Ined).
This behaviour takes into account the unexpected pregnancy (24%), as well as the bad planned or unpredicted birth.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of receipt prevention such as the pile or the spiral still show a 5-6% detrimental rate.
According to the Institute, which states that the continuation of the pills consumers between 20 and 40 years used by the pile has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of receipt prevention has, however, enabled a better control of farmability.
Anyway, eight of the births are planned carefully today.
When one of the five couples even calculate exactly in the month, and, if possible, the yeartime in which it seems best to get a child.
Spe-Culular Reparation at the room station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his cameras from the occupation of the International Space Station (ISS) have been used more than seven hours in the world room to perform the speculatory reparation of a defected sun collective sector that is inappropriate for the continuation of scientific works at the station.
A expected extent that, due to its duration, the removal of resident modules, the ability to organize it, and the tools based by the astronautes to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred in the middle week when the astronautes had downloaded the Harmony module from the space-free discovery, a large part of cylinder forms, which will soon take the scientist and Japanese labs.
This module is a kind of landing broadcast for the module labs.
But you have to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the occupation was, therefore, to implement a 17.5 tonnes of difficult power production module on sun collectives already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After it had placed it, the restructuring of the solar collective sectors of the module was 76 metres of spending.
And it continued that one of the collectors that make it up as a cordeon was protected by an attached cable on a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was arrested in order to not charge the collector anymore.
The astronautes that originally for a control were to leave the space-free Discovery and then to repair another solar collective sector, whose rotation system was wrong, seemed forced to spread to the protected collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to spacious at the end of the 30 meters long-handed arm of the rooms at which the station was set to take the repair.
He is one of the best spacewalkers of NASA.
Great, resistant, very sent, he has a well developed top bodies and long arms.
So the 46-year-old Ar'a was chosen to operate the damaged solar collection sector .
After accurately exploiting the damage, he translated the misleading cable and strengthened a kind of shine at the covered place.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who stayed near the clue, and, by drinks, by the other astronautes, including Peggy Whitson, commandant of the occupation.
The tool that he used, a mini-hockey locker, converted with isolator to prevent the solar cold sectors that produce several hundred volt to prevent the electric ship, the astronauts had discovered and built on the station board .
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely stumbled before he was counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronautes enjoyed a half-day rest before seven astronautes today returned to the space discovery to probably arrive back to the earth midweek.
The title of the EADS on the border is sanctioned
After the Aviation and Defence Group has announced that it must be exposed between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to affect the residues of the A400M, the EADS action presents a clear decrease in the Paris Börs.
Currently, EADS loses 4% at 21.96 euros at the Paris Börse.
The group was forced to review their business forecasts for 2007 once again with regard to the delays caused by the only slowly progressive development of the A400M engine, which delay the tiny flight of the flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate the delay in the delivery of their military transport aeroplane are between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion airbus , reported the EADS's mother concerns.
As a result of these costs, the EADS will be forced to announce new operational objectives (EBIT) for 2007 without further details in the presentation of its four-year results.
The group also indicates that the estimation of the new costs is associated with the six-month residue.
Remembering that the EADS' business service falls from 86% in 2006, essentially due to the delay of another programme, which is related to the very large aircraft A380, costs.
Originally, the group had proposed a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The selection of the Quo status
On Sunday, it will not be stressing to tell the urnes: the mass of the Russians will be decided for President Putin's Party, the United Russia.
After a very disturbed election fight, she visits her efforts for stability, even by authorism.
Three days before Parliament's elections, the Russian President Wladimir Putin sent a message to the electors who have already been opened, but whose content is secret.
He does this in his property as a candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml Party for which a great victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President did not see anything when he received the foreign lawyers, and he satisfied to provide a new point of attack against the west powers that are accused of the mixture - his favorite theme during the election battle.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope our honest choices, extremely transparent and open, choices without disappointment , and he adds.
In view of the opposition, they realized that.
She's stucking a choice battle under pressure.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that it would never have given such painful waves, not even at the time of Eltsin .
Following the pressure of the demonstration on the last week, the former School Meister Garry Kasparovder was condemned to five days of prison, according to the lawyer continued to prohibit the cluster.
The Russians have kept the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without spending, two many further questions are addressed:
Who will come to Putin's follow-up as President?
The Office dated yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections on 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to make themselves until 23 December.
Since he chose 2000 and was reselected in 2004, Wladimir Putin could not follow a mandate.
And now there's no follower.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
The President of Parliament's Majesty and all the powerful Party of the United States of Russia will choose the Government and President?
Whatever it will be, in the Parliament or in the presidential elections, the power will be triumphed.
This is Tradition.
The Russians have kept the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, and they are not the master of their shicksals, says the Sociolog Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
History Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of Sankt Petersburg is still going back: The citizen society has developed in this country, which has been Christianized for five centuries after Europe, only very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
Following the liberal reforms of the 90s, Putin reconnected to the model of a parental state, which was perfectly adopted by the population, so much more, since this new pateralism was not followed by terror, but a certain economic welfare, Mary Lipman said of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians from free parts are denied to the personal responsibility they have shortly placed on the day after the USSR's disappearance.
What longer do you think?
This phenomenon relates to all societies, the business world.
And the administrative salite understands to keep the status Quo: 65 Governors (of 85 Russian presidents) lead to the local election lists of the United States of Russia.
The new, western freedoms are often equal to chaos, as in the 90s.
Generality prefers stability.
In this regard, the Russians will not vote to the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year Professor: What longer do you think?
And those who are in power are not so bad that they may reject.
A Severe Age
After being treated more than 60 years of confidence, the Nazi archive of Bad Arolsen, which documents the shick sales of 17,5 million of victims of Hitler regime, is now available.
The 47 million documents of the archive submitted at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen were not able to be seen until now, except with a humanitary purpose, so individual and namely, so on request of an ancient victim or of his members.
The eleven states of their administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to make them available in May 2006 for researchers and historians.
After the conclusion of the ratification process of this Decision, the opening is valid since yesterday.
Home Information
The access to historics to Bad Arolsen will be enabled to conduct research, especially on the deportation of prisoners, the inhabitants of the conversion camps and the health of the forced workers, explains Reto Masters, leader of these archives, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were to make these named documents available to the public due to the heavy character of certain information.
For example, the common homosexuality or spiritual disturbance of some deportation victims.
The incomelists of the concurrence camps or the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo have been collected for a practical reason after the war: to find civils who were deported or undertaken of the force work and may provide them a evidence of their imprisonment to prevent them.
Today, there are more than 300 stakeholders in Bad Arolsen, thousands of personal questions.
However, a part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
Nothing of the basic news in these documents was expected, Mr Wolfgang Benz, leader of the Research Room for Antisemitism of the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, the mutual trade between India and Europe reaches the 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is the main Indian trade partner and is 18% of its external trade.
The Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian opposite, Kamal Nath, suggested that the European Union and India hoped to submit a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's foreign ministers gave the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations in order to submit free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Southeast N° (Asia) with regard to the mutual trade between India and Europe already reached the 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is the first Indian trade partner and is 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but, according to the numbers of the European Commission, India is only the new EU trade partners.
A free trade agreement will make the two economic areas enormous and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million Europeans , occupied by Peter Mandelson .
Europe is the first or second market for the most commonly exported products from India, the Commissioner further explained that the Asian and the lowly gigant exchanges annual goods in the value of 47 billion euros and services in the value of 10 billion euros, this week, the President of the European Commission in New Delhi, had been awarded by the European Commission's Presidency, and was deceived that the mutual trade has not yet exploited its potential. The EU and India are meeting their eighth diplomates in New Delhi, with the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

In order to avoid the threats that the conditions at the end of the year will be particularly difficult and to give the banks a greater consciousness of the way they should organize their liquidity positions at this time, the Bank has the intention of providing a significant part of its stocking facilities during the maintenance phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks .
The Bank further states that on 6 December, at 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be incurred on the basis tax and only until 10 January.

This normally happens for a week.
The BoE also adds in its communication that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the different rates of the interconnectional feeds from day to day with its principle rates.
The different inter-band rate between day and day was 5.829% in the middle of the middle.
The three-night rate has been paid to 6.6%, something since September 18th.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis from summer, the sums of the Bank of England were linked to penalty taxes that the banks had detained to take them in charge.
According to certain currencies, strengthened by the development of the pump rate in contrast to the euro, many are expected to sign for the sums that the European Central Bank has led into a more beneficial interest rates and with safe discrimination.
UMP and NC refuse to check the PS proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP groups and New Centers refused to discuss the articles of the socialist legislation on purchasing power, which corresponds to the text.
The text found in the context of a socialist nine (the session on an initiative of a parliamentary group) immediately adopted measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS in the middle of the middle of the PS, of which the majority of 50% of the employment supplies, of the re-impact of the TIPP, of a transport check or of the limitation of the staff.
After UMP and NC voted against the examination of the article (180 votes against 115), the meeting was resolved after the main debate, which offered too serious changes between majority and opposition, a few hours before the TV contribution of Nicolas Sarkozy on the purchasing force.
The leader of the Members of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as a amendment to the legislation for the correction of the funds that had been examined last week by the Assembly.
A new festival is born
Following numerous advantages regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadel_a by C3 Presents, the Promotor/Produe announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival of the British Product Melvin Benn.
It is a honor for our company to work together with one person who has served, not more and less than the example of the current festival movement in America , shared Charlie Jones from C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 makes the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer goal for camping vacation.
The Festival will be found remote from 8 to 10 August on a 500 big farm of acre about 40 minutes from Philadelia.
The leader of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, previously called Mean Fiddler, is one of the products of the most renommated festivals of the world.

In 1999, Melvin Benn® Portfolio added the Leeds Festival, and then, 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn is concerned about the production of the license concessions and the organizational tasks of the Glasstonbury Festival, which can take up up to 177.500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, the Glasstonbury describes as the most inspiring event in which he has ever attended, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn work parallelly to offer the area a festival event in the style.
We have chosen Philadeliya as a market and worked zealously with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the town of Philadeliya, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and welcomed on this project.
Sadly, we remain in Political debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we could discuss Melvin Benn and meet preparations to create a great festival in a extraordinary place that will finally benefit the population."
C3 Presents raised the Lollapalooza - Festival 2005 in Grand Park Chicago again to live after it had been in 2002 with Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival profile.
The two events were able to achieve $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in breakfast taxes.
These two festivals are located in the city area.
"The model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, but our stays are better located on the City Green Places," says Charlie Jones.
"The goal is to meet these two concepts together in one way or other in order to present the impression of a rural festival on the age and a state in the asiatic way."
Vineland is on the half road between Philadel and Atlantic City.

His partners from C3, who have received the top Inde Promoter Price of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.

These lock tests belong to the delegated tasks.
A political "heikles mandate" because the Governing Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, claiming "away productions".

This month Quebec also presented four long and four short movies on the American Film Institute Fest.
Does the borse be a final year-rally? Incompatible with experts due to the US hypotechnical crisis
With nearly five weeks to the end of the year at the border, the investors have already bound their hands to the next end-year Rally.
However, experts cannot create safe prognoses.
Banif believes that purely considered statistically, in December, the month of December is usually involved in a positive market development
However, it is not advisable to create a short-term and only on the basis of statistics, especially if the current market event is to be taken seriously.
Although other experts do not make such a strong growth in the last weeks of the year, they note that the rate of the rate is determined by the eligibility given by the market and market shareholder, which investments because of the lack of safe asset funds, mainly in pension funds, which are significantly affected by the valuable trend.
Accordingly, these experts consider that the borses are more strictly influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we are not able to evaluate the amount of the possible reduction of the US notes bank's interest, a uncertainty which is, in particular, to the higher oil price and to the increase in the inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the BPI Department in Spain, agrees that it is a expected time to declare a future market Rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert's assured.
The Spanish Action Index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its maximum mark on 8 November of 15.945,7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, Anal in Intermoney, Ibex 35 could conclude by restructuring the Investment Funds and the traditional review of the pension case each year, each year, with nearly 16.000 points.
However, the expert pointed out that this year things could develop something different, especially because of the already in December two, and then directly after the day of the bridge to the Constitution, the end-year Rally.
According to the analysis, price changes would not affect the market density.
Following the assessment of Federico Olucha, Anal in the Bank Inversis, the previous marketing assessments are available at a nearly technical level, which could lead to a difference from the index values, depending on the impact of the US hypotechnical crisis.
The analyz trusts that these are positive.
When selecting the values that Ibex should be forwarded to new maximum levels, the analystes agree.
Solana of Intermoney indicates that this year the large values are in the row.
For the value winners, the expert would count the two large banks and some immobility companies, since the electricity sector will be too high at the date given.
The Federico Olucha assures the Bank Inversis that the increases in connection with the bank and industry sector will be made available.
If the Rally actually occurs, the immobility companies will benefit from it.
In the past months, we hope that other immobility companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will be in the same way as the expert.
As regards the increased consumption behaviour during Christmas, the market event will be determined in the last half of the periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive change results, even if they are only in smaller numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December only showed a decline in two cases.
When the end of 2003 placed the technology flash, it led the bears from their crisis and started the last real year's rally.
This year, when Ibex 35 to 28.17 percentage points was recovered, December showed a short increase of 6,68%.
If 2008 the fifth winning year will be followed (Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and can also show an end-yearly.
Popular will open its 200 credit institutions from Montags to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of his own.
In total, 200 of these have been distributed in the most economical regions of Spain.
For the Institute that operates under the label Popular Max, these discharges mean a big milen steel.
But also for the rest of Spanish institutions, since popular as the first group of banks is waiting for the spring to extend its opening times to 20:30 a.m. and set Saturday from 10 a.m. to 20 a.m.
The BBVA Banking Group, who also repeatedly read the extension of its opening periods in the discharges, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the communities seem to be targeted to a agreement, where 75% of all Saturdays will be closed and opened on a weekend afternoon, even though not for the knowledge.
Whether additional banks of the new initiatives adapting the opening periods will depend on the experience values of the Popular Bank.
And this is also the purpose that the people are following with their project.
The aim is to extend the openings of those who can, due to their situation, find the purchasing knowledge of individual, small and medium-sized enterprises but also of large purchases.
The Bank wants to open the 200 new branches during the next 18 months, because it is not new, but changed openings.
For this purpose, the Bank will transform the spaces of those discharges already in business areas and simultaneously compare with the individual customer profile of different areas.
Thus the extension of opening times will be linked to a new form of spaces that will result in a more current, colour-free design.
The competent Bank Representative Angel Rivera assures that restructuring does not require greater investment, but has been incurred with an increased personal setting, since a staff needed no longer six, but eight or nine employees.
The reductions, which are even equipped for SMEs, will not be reduced by financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept at nine in Madrid.
And the experiences fell positive, like Angel Rivero.
The discharges of Bravo Murillo, O ́Do and the Gran Via have been selected for what seems to have been a smart decision.
Popular leads about 2500 Nederlassungen.
And more 60 who operate under the name of Monocredit. These are specialized on immigrants and also indicate extended openings, even on sun and holidays.
The model of the BBVA is not used in these PopularMax sales because most of them will be offered a wide selection of non-financial services to sell.
We don't want to present competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
With the telephone, they are temporarily agreed to rebuild mobile phones using external bank staff.
The Spanish Telecinco doubles his worth for the first time and thus overcomes his rival Antena 3.
We've done it.
With this set, the business leader of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, gave his satisfaction at the end of the Börs. The sender guided by him had increased his value about the twice of his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, was his joy: That's exactly what is hurt me; not that we have a growth, but that we have less losses, he established.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they were not too deeply deep.
Telecinco ended yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This winning reduces its losses to 15,66%.
According to Bloomberg's information, the company value now reaches EUR 4.488,88 million, with the mediaset controls the main share of capital (52%) and Vocento is only shared by 13%.
The Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 proposition points yesterday and has been reported to a total of 40.5% since January, so his market value is 2.193.46 million.
In contrast, the market value of other banknotes of communications undertakings increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, Prisa (reporter of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2.518.53 million and Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be reported by the fact that it is two similar companies as Vasile.
The question of which we actually can act bronze-technically, which price and how we can make it lucrative at customer levels.
Telecinco explained his advantage for a week ago to grow up to the first television seed this year with more than 1000 million brutto wines from advertising income. This assured Guiseppe Tringali, the business leader of Telecinco and Publicespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the claim should be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising in comparison with the 965.4 million from the previous year by 3.6%.
In the case of Antena 3, the pure conversion increased by 1.6% in the first nine months (to 4.4 million), while the net income from television was only able to show an increase of 0.7% (63.4 million).
The main factor for the better spring of Telecinco, compared to the high Payout-Ratio, which the company could show until the current time: 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarria was a 100-percent division.
Vasile, however, assures that the ratio after purchasing 33% of the parts of the endmol, with mediaset as a mother company, could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always given more significantly to this time.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose asset values were already able to increase by purchasing 33% of the end-moll shares.
According to the analystes, the market is currently indicating some loss tensions.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction of the expected growth rate, which will be reduced from 10.5% from 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% to 5.1%.
This also reduced the expected winning of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 Options.
1.
Ibersecurities: sets on his high efficiency and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both actions.
2.
Caja Madrid: missing Telecinco (coppers) due to the multi-fold incentive and prosperous markets a more beneficial position in Antena 3 (holding).
3.
JPM Organ: recommended to repeat expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (satured market and bader economic climate)
The Congress agrees with the Directive of the MIFID, which entered into force on 1 November.
Parallelly to the Parliamentary Development, which has concluded today with the Congress Decision in the Senate on the project related amendments, the Government published the provisions of the new law in order to enable both rules to enter into force until the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies honoured the efforts of the Congress and Senate Members who pursued the goal in their negotiations and votes to set up the best possible scheme that guarantees the security of investors and regulates the individual undertaking A to ensure that such a general efficiency of market events is effective.
The MIFID, which re-establishes the Value Services Regulation, is accompanied by the modernisation of the financial markets to improve the protection of investors, the increase in the control of the Spanish Value Paper Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the European Union's various control participants.
The new Directive enables both specialized companies and natural or legal persons to offer financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services undertakings (ESIS) to the consultative companies associated with investment and distribution companies.
Furthermore, it extends the number of financial transaction systems, so that the regulated environmental markets will be added to the multilateral systems of the operation and the systems for internationalization of trade contracts which would be in competition with the current economic operators.
The law bindings investment undertakings to register the key points of their company profile, the confrontation and the forms of circulation with risks on the market and all the activities carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Economic Commission of the Congress had further changes in the context of the decision that the debt eligible for the investor must now be considered as complex financial resources because of their high risk degree of obligations for investor. The U.S. hypotechnical and banking crisis has been assessed. (USH hypotechnical crisis)
­ the entry into force of the Directive on legal restriction of the workshops of diplomated economic scientists; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation, which restricted the worksspaces reserved for economic scientists, was adopted.
The Senate, on its side, sets new positions in the financial sector how the economic mechanism, which is on an external account, does not need authorisation from the CNMV and can offer its services to commercialize products and to gain customers at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) was decreased at five decades in November and is now at 4.1%.
The Eurostat indicator to evaluate the rate of inflation within the European Union provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication corresponds to the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) which strive to compare data with US products through the notification of local and quality.
The prognoses for the indicator can be created early by applying the same procedure as in the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time uses other statistical modeling methods to evaluate the information not available at the time of the occupation.

Virgin is calculated with Northern Rock Income of over 42 billion euros in the next three years
The values of Northern Rock were decreased for more than the half after the Bank had demanded the British note bank in the middle of September last year for an emergency credit, and they were in the meantime only 12.000 million pounds (which corresponds to 16.800 million euros).
At that time, the Bank's assets covered 25,000 million pounds, a sum that has been significantly reduced by customers' trust loss within two and half months, and despite the 100 percent guarantee of the government that the money is safe until the crisis will continue to be decreased.
The Virgin company, who would continue the group after receipt under the name Virgin Money, must immediately carry out a quarter of the income of the British banks that will be combined from the installations of the next three years to purchase exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The group of the multimillionary Richard Branson, who is in the United Kingdom by his advanced public campaigns, aims to allow 500,000 pounds (approximately 70 million euros) to flee in advertising and marketing campaigns annually to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Concern, in which three other companies are shared as his preferred offerer to lead it out of the Innance.
The citizen of Totana has been arrested because of a common deceit to participate in urban corruption
The Spanish police adopted today morning the current citizen of the city community of Murcia, Totano (Partido Popular) town (Partido Popular), due to the thrilled decree of destruction in urban corruption that was discovered this week.
One of the Secretary-Generals of the Community and the head of the Police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo sent the Office of Juan Morales, currently the Deputy of the Popular Party and at that time the chairman of the Community of Totana, and could be, according to information of Cadena SER, the original draftsman of the Complete.
The officers continue to investigate the business records of the community and the Ministry of Civil Planning and do not exclude further arrests within the next hours.
The lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of the major suspicious at the beginning of this week to be discovered of a state-building corruption.
According to Cadena SER , the lawyer of the lawyer, and therefore privileged deputy Juan Morales, was determined at the leave of his man's residence because of important chargeable documents to be related to the completion.
In addition, other sources of information from the joint payments of Morales report to a gallic building undertaking that predicts the conclusion of a state-building contract in which the building of a 200 hectares of large surface was imposed.
Eight people are currently in investigation.
Bono agrees to be the candidate of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the case of a choice, in the Congress.
The former Defence Minister José Bono has adopted the Board of the Government President and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and will present the list of PSOE candidates at the coming elections in Toledo and, in the case of a choice of socialists, the Office of the President of the Congress.
This is how José Blanco, PSOE Organization Secretary, and Bono has been announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero City found today at the main seat of the party.
The Governing Board is justified by the former Minister because it is important to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In the case of a victory for the socialists in the coming elections, the chairman of the Congress for the Parties would like to be candidate.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress president, which had announced on the last 15 November that the next general elections would no longer come to an end of his car in the public and use it in the University of Climate Protection.
The former Minister must have concluded that the Government president had continued to take his back to political events since two years ago.
Furthermore, he noted that the party, as in the name of the Vice-President for Economy, would not wish to preserve the citizens who would receive the posts of the President of the Congress in the case of an election, and used it as a act of transparency.
If he actually should take the office, he hopes to make the room a house of respect and not to convert the pleasure or the voice to allow them to appear more similar to the citizens.
Sadly, it is timely to gain the impression that the only place in which you cannot speak in Madrid is the Congress; thus the Governing Chairman in the Senate has been interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current president Manuel Martín and his work and said he would not want to resurrect the appearance that the office had already adopted, since otherwise his political opposers would consider this as arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is undermined by both the scepticians of climate change and those who put a social and political debate in front of it, the movement must be a strong cohesion.
In particular, if it is a leader of the movement, who, like the Governing President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against the islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, brings it into account the declaration of the action or non-action of his government, which has decided that Spain is within the EU at the top of the countries that have at least fulfilled the conditions of the Kioto Protocol.
Who are responsible for the non-heritage of the standards to which this is involved, and why his government, which proposed the Treaty with the Planet, did not stop this development.
He is now forced to present the Spanish citizens the measures against climate change without interruption.
Which companies will be affected by which of the citizens' behaviour should be changed, which individual and collective safeguard measures should be carried out and which economic consequences they have.
Exactly said who must sacrifice and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there will be no such statements in the future.
It's just because it's about the sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can be implemented against climate change are unconditional.
They are costly, irrelevant and threatened for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the benzin center proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero has seen the choice strategy that he has seen forced to restore the proposal.
Therefore, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, so with pure propaganda and empty speech without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, the Commission, Committees, Protocols and new comments.
With its contracts with the planet, the other must not speak as appropriate for electoral campaigns, nor complain or ask, but instead follow the complaints, to break out the meetings, and to please others with his mildness and kindness.
But this can only happen if the Treaty does not differ from its pure nature and therefore does not predict that the road will be future to the only movement, or that we can refresh ourselves with a fashion.
The citizen master and the police officer of Totana due to a communication in a state-building corruption.
The Guardia Civil arrested the citizen of the city of Totana in Murcia, who was observed by the local police officer, the secretary of the Secretary of the Secretary of the Civil Secretary and a hotel undertaking because of the courageous disappointment of state-building crimes, it was called today from investigation circuits.

The investigations are carried out by the Communal Authority against State-building Delegates, in view of the Central Unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, have made eleven further investigations that most of them have been in direct connection with the arrests found in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rosas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was established in Totana: the holder of a regional aircraft acquire that would have been acting as a mediumman.

Things that can make
1.
If you agree with this, we will turn away from the expression of the month book and instead try to find a price label for other names with relevant powers.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you have been invited to introduce your proposals.

Our Phinetic Correspondentine explains to us last night in the most finish magazine, Helsingin Sanomat, an emergency comment (Finland is also at the top of the PISA ́e), which refers to the note published in the same magazine, on 18 November; accidentally on the day that the book of Blackburns has been criticized.
The content of the philosophy philosophy has become the subject of the public debate after the tragedy of Jokela.
The responsibility for the crushed murder is a abitant who cited the works of Platons and Netzsches in his news.
The President of the Education Council for the Philosophes, Pekka Elo, requested the teacher in an interview of the daily journal Helsingin Sanomat to become a critical position against Platon and proposed to stop the teaching of Platons from the under-stairs teaching plans for the philosophy of Gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal internet downloads in the criminal law book:
A. Download of a song would be a law breaking with six months of prison.
However, if you return a musical business under a value of 400 euros, this is only a simple distortion (Article 623.1).
B. If you take the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the steel will be tested as a penalty, however, the penalty is less than when it is downloaded (Article 234 Criminal Book).
C. If you listen to a car and return it forty hours later, the punishment is still less than at a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less severely shared in a shock than in a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebellious distortion, a prison penalty of three to 12 months after itself (Article 154 Criminal Book), while the data-A exchange has a free move between six months and two years
(Article 270 Criminal Journal).
E. In accordance with Article 184(2) of the Criminal Journal, sexual disturbance on the workplace is considered less bad than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade with copyright films, which the author has not found the authorisation, shall be exposed to a penalty as the distribution of pornographic films to a minor year (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should have the right, somebody has made his requests very well.

My household offers me one of his long, strange research articles with the title: money leads to the activation of certain brain areas, especially if the others get more of it.
Thus, the feelings resulting from the monthly payment depend on the content of the colleagues.
This was created by a tomographic-magnical reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest series of the magazine Science.
According to Bernd Webers, the author and director of the Bonner Header Research room Live&Brain, the activation was the greatest when the participant gave the right answers and dismissed his player.
The researchers were able to find that the brain always was very moderate when both participants had the right answer and then received the same content; but when one of them received the double, it also came to a stronger brain.
I am not very sure whether so much scientific efforts are required to achieve such a result.
The state advice from the Balkan
Carla del Ponte has seen inevitably since eight years after the crimes of the Balkan Wars. Its office is located in the State of the Court of Justice of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Your mandate will expire the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and laughing eye because the main responsible for the massacher of Srebrenica - in the eight thousand bosnish muslims - the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serb-Bossian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on the free foot.
Their names are listed by the Regisseur Marcel Schüpbach from Switzerland as a model for the title of his documentary films La Liste de Carla (2006, yet not in Spain); a movie that, with the time of a Polit-Thriller, follows the Swiss state advocate from Rad to New York at its staff, tracks the disappeared criminals and puts the respective governments under pressure, so that these networks may be closer.
Which assurance is best acceptable for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers any possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost efficiency which depends on the replacement of different persons, including older, sex, date of manufacture of the leader's sign, family position, type of car to be assured and its use, etc.
A car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the KFZ insurance than the correct vehicle model.
To one time, one must be aware of what we have to do here.
An auto-assurance is an agreement between a insurance company and a insurance holder.
This Agreement shall be established in writing by means of a insurance contract, which determines that the company receives the approved insurance premium and is binding, in contrast, to present the corresponding sum of derogation in a case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of a insurance composed by several persons, including older, sex, date of manufacture of the leader, family status, type of vehicle to be assured or use.
Insurance undertakings shall fix their prices in accordance with statistics, so that contributing payments will also be eligible for an accidental accident.
That is why more than 25 years old and women have to give less contributions, since statistics show that these groups have shown a lower accident rates thanks to their view.
The same applies to married persons, since they, as stated by the statistical values and then by conviction of the companies, are less accidents like the single.
The benefit of the vehicle affects the frequency of the driving and thus the probability of an accident.
The more often use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premiums, the insurance must take into account a series of points.
That is why the driver also needs to study the situation based in order to select exactly the car insurance that is in the first place to meet his personal needs.
We are now listening to the most important points that should be taken into consideration when choosing a assurance, not only to be able to take a powerful choice but also to make a price-oriented choice.
Those under 25 years are taking place in the choice of a price-profit insurance on numerous obstacles, such as the small drive practice and the young leadership.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance protection to complete full insurance, there are even more price-valuable alternatives.
The careful drivers can choose a fullkasko with self-participation, thus covering the performance of a full-case insurance, but are offered to a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay a part of the amount owned by the damage.
The amount shall be determined before the conclusion of the Treaty and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is less than the amount to be paid, explained by Luis Noguera, the main representative of Spain in the first Europe, to a online insurance transmission undertaking.
Another option is the extended insurance that assures the customers against external accidents, but not the damage occurred in their own car.
This type of insurance would cover the steel, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a Council.
If you are less than 25 years old, it is in the hand to reduce the insurance costs; thus your writing will be exhausted by trying to walk carefully and avoid accidents.
A letter is a decrease of the basic rif in the corresponding insurance company.
In contrast, a penalty payment includes an increase in the tariff.
The height of credits and penalties depends on the company and their income.
If the company has an exciting year behind it, it can be permitted to add bonus counts , Noguera states.
Once the 25-year-old mark is over, it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract. This is why it is the fact that the accident rate is decreased with the continuous driving practice.
Thus, it is most important to decide for a complete insurance with self-participation.
Normally, youths cannot benefit from their experience, both in the case of an accident and at the time of the driving , by the Spanish leader of the company, and in order to ensure that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the starter's expiry.
However, there is a married customer who does not have children, more advisable, complete insurance; of course only if it allows the financial situation of the corresponding person.
Insurance sites, marriage couples with children apply as customers with the lowest accident rates, thus low their contribution payments.
In this case, a total insurance with self-repartition (with an amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. If you have received a high credit, an extensive insurance is recommended to be used first for the vehicle year.
They are running at all relaxed and a greater purchasing force that allows them to set a strict contribution payment , states Luis Noguera.
The Rentner proposes to conclude a full insurance with self-repartition (with an amount of EUR 150), or an extended insurance that is only used in a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it is necessary to consider that the car insurance is something very important, not only because it is a leader against possible accidental damage, but also because it offers high costs that require a fundamental choice that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glassgow hopes in Mayland at the point for eight finals
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will be fighting on Sunday in San Siro the point that they missed to achieve their objectives before the Championsleague forward. The Italians need to reach the point to the top of their group while he decides to participate in the shots.
The Italian mastership has already visited five points and has already participated in the fifth degree with an undetermined in Portugal, while the Celtic Glassgow needs a more than nine points to ensure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not include the Befa Lissabon with four points.
The two games of the group D will find a week before the end of the sixth game round, since the FC Mailand has to arrive at the FIFA Club World Mastership in Japan, where he will fight at the 13th in the half final for the first time on the entry into the final, which is located on the 16th place.
This group will be completed in front of all others and the undetermined in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadion to the outcome of all sides, even if both teams are attempted to win. The Italians will not speculate at home, namely, the Celtic Glassgow will know that they would be in the case of a victory and thus would have a better starting position in the 8th final.
The manship of Gordon Strachan could even have a decline in a sleep of the FC Shakhtar. However, he should not trust too much in such circumstances, for at nine points equality is the part of the Ukrainians; they had lost the last week in Glasgow (2-1), but they could win in the second game (2-0).
Therefore, the Mayan countries will try to avoid the Schotten at night. They hope that the second time afterwards, the 8th final of the converted championsleague will be shown after they were won in the previous game season in exactly the same range by a gate of Kaka at the time of jump (1-0) and by a 0 to 0 undetermined on the game.
As the FC Shakhtar waits for the victory of the Rossoneri, the mastership will have to be able to play on its own game, since the achievement of the 8th final and its membership in EUFA depends on victory and a delay of Celtic Glassgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the view to continue to participate in the largest mastership, Benfa Lissabon could reach the victory and thus contribute to the EUFA.
200,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls presented in Canadian Vancouver before the eyes of 200,000 viewers of the start shot for their first tour after the band was solved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said soon before the beginning of their concert at the stadium GM Place de Vancouver that the vote in the reunified band was exciting.
About the 200,000 people were able to live the concert at the exhausted stadium, showing a video about the history of the band, which had provided the end of the ninety years for Furore.
The reunification and the world tour oversees the publication of a new album, which includes its largest hair and two other new songs, Headlines and Voodoo, and appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls carryed on the staff of golden armbands that the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham, had given them before.
The sporter was among the fans in the public, which the GM Palace was to please, although the nerves of his wedding Victoria had prohibited him in the previous days.
With the preparation for Schow, Victoria Beckham claimed that the British Star hasn't seen our gardenobe once, and therefore I'm fully stressed what he's going to think of.
Sporty Spice , whose exit from the group in 1998 due to internal differences in view of two years later the group's resolution followed, held their nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And therefore I thought, why not; so I am glad that I had taken this decision, Chisholm said to the training of the band that she had taken for nine years ago.
The song also claimed that the disputes were removed, and they were all very pleased again.
However, many things have changed since the last common attack of Spice Girls in 1998.
At one time, the group arrived in a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, according to the report of the CTV TV.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received from an army of children.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will occur next in California, San José (4 December) and in Los Angeles (5th and 7th December).
In Madrid, they will attend the stairs on 23 December.
New Promises on Earth Gas Conflict between Russia and Ukraine
A new price struggle between Ukraine and Russia, which causes Russian exports of fuel to West Europe to be affected.
The major part of Russian land gas exports to the European Union (EU) is led by Ukraine and each fight between the two N.
Kiew has warned that if Moscow has to pay the price for the earthquake, it will take account of transit taxes from Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two countries reduced deliveries in the EU countries last year.
The youngest fight between Kiew and Moscow is at a time that the Ukrainian Government and the Russian, State Gasmonopol Gazprom are trying to make an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian Earth Gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more, since the concerts agreed up to 50% in the case of land gas from the neighboring Turkmenistan.
The analystes say that this could mean that Ukraine must pay 40% more for the imports of gasprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas trading states," said the Ukrainian Economic Minister Anatoli Kinakh of the News Agency Re replies.
"The changed earth gas prices should, of course, be connected to our arguments regarding the height of transit taxes [in Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last large earthquake between Moscow and Kiew in January 2006, gasprom deliveries were reduced to Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which drasticly increased prices.
Russian gas is a quarter of the provision of the European Union.
Russia has developed the biggest gases worldwide, but many of them are still developed.
The result is that Gazprom completed its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other central Asian former Soviet N.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Schottical State Health Service must improve the controls of prejudicial rulers for workers outside Europe, said a member of the control body outside.
The recommendation of the main financing controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought together with the attack on the airports of Glasgow in June.
Black also stressed that the Scotch State Health Service had no precise ideas regarding the number of his foreign workers.
However, his report pointed out that other important controls were correctly carried out in a sample of five health staff.
The main financial controller examined the staff recruited outside the countries of the economic race according to the attack on the airports of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, a Iraqian doctor at the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who occurred in a video transfer in October in Old Bailey, and was charged in connection with the moving car bomb attack in Britain.
The State Health Service is expected to carry out controls in order to ensure that these are the necessary qualities, experiences and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health partners use the Disclosure of Scotland to review prejudice records, the Agency does not wish to obtain these information outside the United Kingdom.
The report of the Major Reviewer now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the proposal should take up guidelines of the Strategy Committee, helping employees in controls in different countries.
"Although we found indications on these controls in some personal documents, these were not routinely carried out." The report stated.
Black said that the Scotch health staff would follow their research guidelines prior to the establishment, but say: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Schottland president Dr. Peter Terry said that it was "extermly unlikely" that investigations would identify the future terrorist attacks of NHS partners.
"In the report it says that the current prefix tests of the NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what additional value the recommendations will be provided," he said.
The Scotch health staff say that they now have 1.161 foreign workers, most of them are doctors and sisters.
However, the financial controller warned that the number would be likely, even because the events had problems to identify those employees authorised at an indefinite time.
The investigation continued to conclude that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glassgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were mainly observed.
This includes pass, work authorisations, and qualification controls.
the Switzerland Government is currently reviewing its own and guidelines for controls before the start of the establishment of foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "It was a suggestion to do this work in the light of the terror attack on the airports of Glasgow."
She added that, in relation to health discussions, the Schottic Government would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines were planned in respect of control studies in the pre-specification of all employees, including those from the foreign country - their next month publication.

208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist complot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it took 208 militaries to cells because of their association, which had planned a future attack on an oil plant and on spiritual and security forces.
The public television of the worldwide largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to cut rackets.
Sympathisants of Al-Qaida have started a campaign against the Monarchia, which is a United States member since 2003, following the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight military mentioned by a foreign citizen plants an attack on a station of oil in the province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has made a 35.000 man strong rapid entrance group to shalt after a missing Al Quaida attack on the worldwide worldwide oil processing installation in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal statement, states that 18 of the arrested members of a cell led by a "Raket Expert" who immigrated illegally into the country.
He reports that the military people had planned to put eight projects into the Kingdom.
More 22 of the captives had proposed the report to kill spiritual and security forces.
The Government has warned more to do to stop Saudis, who are trying to join Al Qaida Milises, who want to fight the allied fighting forces and the U.S. citizens of the Muslim government, which is considered chessish by the Hardliners under the Sunnith Saudi.
Al Qaida Milisen considers many sacred priests in Saudi Arabia as in collaboration with the authorities in support of the king's family dominated by the government.
The Milises - accompanied by the call of Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader, born in Saudi Arabia, to target it to the prosperous Saudi Government - have declined from foreign residences, government buildings and engines of the energy sector.
"This was a very great effort for security forces over the last... five months," a speaker of the Ministry of Interior shared the state TV.
The arrests included also a "medical cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to throw "Takfiri thoughts" - the ideology of the radical sunnitic muslims, supporting violence against Muslims, which will be burned as unbelievers and disbelieving.
Among the prisoners were also 32 persons who were accused of providing financial support to the Millians.
The climate on Venus could demonstrate a view of the future of the earth
The Venus may have been a pleasant place for life once, saying yesterday.
Data of a space ship on a roadway show that the planet is even more like a declined dulling of the earth than it was already aware.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have the same size and have similar planet roads, but the Venus of the sun is something closer.
Millions of years ago, the Venus would have ruled conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even be resident, believers today.
But because of the most impairment of carbon dioxide level effect, the erosion of the atmosphere through sun radiation and a slower rotation temperature, Venus introduced a very different development course.
Today, the planet of water beau is beau and has a surface temperature that is heavy enough to meat bleeds and is devastated by Hurrikan-forced winds and fuels.
The recognition of the Space Sunday Venus Express of the European Room Room Agency, which has examined the plants for a year, provides a renewable role on how the earth could develop in the face of disastrous climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It will be clear why the climate on the Venus is so different to the earth while the planets are very similar."
"Our new data allow to build a scenario in which the Venus has started a billion years ago as the earth, perhaps with a resident environment."
"Admissed Uran" was arrested by the police
A kilo radioactive material, reported by Uran, was arrested last night by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police speaker said that three persons were arrested and that the material was tested.
He didn't know whether it was a sufficient Uran, but he said that it could be recovered for 1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
With Romey said he was not worth a president's candidate to be asked by a snowman.
However, the Republican candidate for the Presidency was ready to put a debate on YouTube, to take questions on video and to send them to the candidate.
No of the questions opened on midweight, on 28 November, were so laughing as the snowman, the democracy on the global heating in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected exactly this time the status of the Republican Party, which will take place in the elections in the next year.
It is not, just as the products of CNN supported the debate with those who chose YouTube Clips to show the approaching candidates.
Nevertheless, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest of a single subject, immigration was at the centre.
The subject is one of the most powerful subjects for the Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undetermined electors to use a electoral ship when they heard things that they heard: The television office noted the points of approval as the candidates were strictly talking about the borders.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national president, and Romney, who had moved to the decision-making issues in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to break the call that he was proud of illegal immigration when he was a citizen of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts to have appointed illegal immigrants to work at home.
The two sickly asked each other as a questionnaire whether one of the candidates would submit an "amnestie" (the illegals would give a regular status and the opportunity to citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian Congress Deputy, and Tom Tancredo, a Congress Deputy from Colorado, were able to follow this subject.
No one of the two men has serious chances for the nomination, but both remain in the run, perhaps because they have been earlier and worse than others to the immigration pauke.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates share the same views in large and whole: decreasing limits, intolerance against illegal migrations.
This subject, together with anxieties about toxic games from China or other concerns about the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between Liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly difficult than other language subjects.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported weapons restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated irrigation should be considered folter.
One of the questionnaires asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to the point that although the Bible was his preferred book, he might not believe literally the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questionnaire asked whether Jesus would be punished by death.
Mike Huckabee - now faced all expectations in the first place in a recently conducted investigation in Iowa thanks to his existing Christian conservativeism - said that death punishment was painful, but needed.
When he was forced to put Jesus on them, he laughed about it and said that Jesus was too smart to ask for a political office.
The run remains extremely open.
Huckabee's growth in Iowa falls together with Ron Paul's youngest successes and his injuries in the middle-week debate.
These two have been shot up from nothing because the two wings of the party were not yet able to be on one of the more and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party from the beginning and convincedly with a guaranteed message about the size of America and a winker to the two wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is not clear.
Laboratory party pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another cup to fall; his way out of this is the same.
For British scandale, this is not particularly cool.
No adeltitel seems to be covered, no Pariser Hotel paid, no extraordinary signs have been succeeded.
But the discovery that a richer businessman S日 for the British Governing Laboratory Party over 650,000 pounds (1.3 million) has deteriorated over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has refused to report this would have been well done without that of Gordon Brown.
When the President had decided for a choice two months ago, the British intellectuality of the British intelligence in a deep way, claiming that the opinions had not affected this decision, it was hoped that he would offer a strong, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, the representative of the Liberal Democrats, in a close manner, has developed the once promised Brown of Stalin to Mr Bean.
The improper salvation of Northern Rock, an addicted bank, showed regulatory weaknesses and bad judgments under the case.
In fact, it is not possible for the Commission to adopt a decision on the proposals for amendment of tax laws to the government.
The taxable loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative puzzles.
A trio of generals at the rest started a rebellion at the top of the Protest House against the reductions of military expenditure: to be a minister of the fighting forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the many of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labours General Secretary (and her former heritage leader) has already come back.
It doesn't mean that Brown's unrevocable direction is coming out.
However, governments can find a turnpoint after which they feel it impossible to rule.
They don't like or trust people, but they usually keep their scheps when a new troop receives the office.
If one time it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister improves the situation and does not need to be there for a long time, it is over: the public service begins to become, the Cabinet Minister begins to defeat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government will be defensive and undefensive.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because he cannot, in contrast to other political leaders, claim to be a new person.
So he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his superior.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax competence documents, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as the officer of the Financial Ministry.
And even if it wasn't directly involved in Blairs Missshicke - such as in the long "Large for Adels Title" research of political parties financing - the electors may believe that he was.
However, Brown's situation is not so bad as she looks like
The deficiencies are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely disturbed.
And the opposite, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's natural stalinistic trends have always promised: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.
The new view of political S.E. is an example.
Abraham’s garboes, who compares his spouse with his useful gifts, does not want public recognition for his will.
It may be like that, but the decision about it was not acceptable to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributions are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who said he had known about Abraham's agreement, but not that it was illegal, will, of course, have to ask some questions; just as Jon Mendleson, Labours' main financial operator, which was told about the employment S. in October.
But yet Brown is not shared: there is nothing that indicates that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his office in June.
The Prime Minister has done the help of the work until now.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he disappointed this disappointment by taking into account an instrument, leading an investigation committee to the subject - to complete the measure, by a Bischof in the rest and a judge.
In this case, the "learning from it" are not very complicated.
When the law has been violated, it's a thing for the police.
On the other hand, Mr Brown needs to do other things, how to find a permanent president for the independent Committee for Standards in the Public Life, which has been unemployed for six months, and to advance with a transient reform of political parties' financing.
This would require the hardlines of the laboratory to cooperate with the conservatives and may be given the special financial relationship with the facilities - bitter pills for a party partyhood such as Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The conservatives now have a clear lead in the opinions issues; he has two years to win the electors; and the only way he can gain a victory is by inappropriate justice and solid power.
Cards
Is the credit crisis in America's credit cards?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that back flows are surrounded.
Now where America's immobility is deteriorated, the rape animals have the credit cards of the country in the vision.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs consider that the credit card losses could achieve 99 billion billion if the departure of under-financed credits spread into other forms of consumer credits.
Signs of effort are clearly visible.
There are increases both in the exhausts and in the rates that measure the share of the credits that are not intriguable or too late for more than 30 days.
In the last month, the HSBC announced that she had taken a 1.4 billion tax collection from its agenous consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
Still, it's too early to get in panic.
Losses and lowness are still low.
According to the Rating Agency Moody, the third quartal summary rate of 3.89% was almost a complete pro-point under the history average.
The deterioration in the Council may be explained in part by technical entities.
An amendment to the rights of the Ananias in 2005 resulted in a disrupted case of concurrence declarations which re-exist for a large part of the card losses; the number of claims (and thus fees) would re-increase whether the general conditions for credit operators would be deteriorated or not.
The industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of their debts pay consumers every month
and confidence in credit card-based value papers is quite strong, despite the rest of the other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research company, considers that the amounts for 2007 will be 25% in the last year.
Direct infection channels between the immobile credit crisis and the credit card are certain: it is likely that consumers take credit card debts now that their own private credits are cut off.
However, the card issuers look at the cash flow on capital values, therefore the falling house prices are not necessary to make a change in the credit value of the credit holder.
You can even be beneficial for the card manufacturers.
The incentives for consumers to continue to count the hypotechnic rates are decreased if the immobility is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts will be more important under the payment priorities.
Card exhibitors can also respond much faster and flexibleer than credit providers to the more powerful conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a quick re-evaluation of the assets.
"We will not wake up one day and evaluate the loans fully," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's main financial reference.
Even if a sudden covering crisis in the credit card is unlikely, the risks of sustainable distortion are significantly more real.
If the lower house prices and a decrease of credit are forced in America, the industry will certainly stand before a more cruel future.
Keep on looking for these fish floors.
British bonds are guilty in the case of Enron
Three British banks, who should be presented for their role in the disgusting system with the former main financing leader of Enron, Andrew Fastow, were guilty of their search in the middle of the week.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for the common conspiration with Fastow in a secret financial deficit in 2000 to deploy themselves on the cost of their employer, on the unfair.
The procedure was established on January.
However, during an audience before the court of the US District Director Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone was guilty of a case of disappointment in use of telecommunications.
The three former leading forces of Greenwich NatWest, one of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were held in Britain during two years of delivery.
In the United States, their case is a loss end of an investigation started after Enron's breakdown in 2001.
The initial accusations against them in 2002 noted Fastow that he was the goal of an investigation of the Government in relation to Enron's decline.
The accusation against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they were coming to Houston in 2000 to exhibit a disgusting complot with Fastow and former Michael Kopper adviser.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a daughter company of a partnership of Enron, controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of innumerable enron engineering engineering, which had been able to drive the company into the concurrence structure.
In the beginning of 2002, the Bank had appreciated the value of its contribution to the daughter company at zero, but the three British men knew that she had actually a significant value.
An undertaking under header control has produced the shares of the bank in the subsidiarity for 1 million.
The bankiers paid the head 250,000€ for a contribution to this company.
According to the complaint, Fastow falsely returned to Enron that the energy undertaking would take 20 million ECU to Greenwich NatWest for their shares in the subsidiary society.
But actually, the 20 million people went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankiers received 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others abstained about 12.3 million, according to the accusation.
In January 2004, Fastow was guilty of two accusations for his role in the Enron's Pleite.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is a six-year prison penalty in the prison of Louisiana.
Kopper is a penalty of three years and one month in a establishment in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on a free foot on the basis of a 1 million penalties that made them needed to live in the United States in the expectation of the court procedure.
Enron, one of the largest companies of the nation, was discouraged in the concurrence in December 2001, after years of bookholding tricks could no longer decrease the billion debts or defective enterprises were profitable.
The breakdown destroyed thousands of workplaces, more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion pension plans.
The Enron Greener Kenneth Lay and the former president Jeffrey Skilling were condemned last year for their roles in the enron-contract break.
Skilling is a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lays sentences for disturbance, distress and other points of complaint were shortly after he died last year for heart disease.
Not completely below in Moscow
The price of a flight of the Marke Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough riqueway to flee from Moscow to Los Angeles is at least 54 million.
But this is a little money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But no one of you asks for so many seats because it is for a family or a business president."
Firer was at the Gulf Stream stand on the last Friday at the Millionary exhibition, a four-day orgy of the consumption set up to see, which was placed in a scarce exhibition center at the border of the city.
In addition to Gulf Stream, more than 200 other Luxury supplied exhibitions have been built, hoped to interest new Russians in money in all, from Mahagoni-scale yachts to diamant-over-screen car grills that would be added to 50 cents.
Firer carefully took a glassing orange porsche at the next measurement state in the vision.
"This is a beautiful car, but it's a little money compared to us," he said.
"Nevertheless of the United States, Russia is the second largest market for flights."
It seems that the Russian capital seems to be overflowed with money like Dallas at his time.
"We have passed through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic riches and went to Europe, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a colleague at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasians at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab overseers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians come as the most visible publishers of money in the world.
The most exclusive luxus marks are looking for their share in gold.
Anotherwhere in Moscow, a conference of the Luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, has been assigned to exchange ideas about how to acquire high-precious goods on markets such as Russia.
(The International Herald Tribune is organized by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billion, totally 282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
Moreover, 103,000 Russian billion people belong to the second class, which are worth 670 billion together, according to the development of funds in the former Soviet Union, which were written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a expert institution here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15,8% of the Russians lived under the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of billion people in Moscow - therefore we're all here," Nicole Marais, a representative of the sale and deal of David Morris, a London Juwelier.
She first visited the Measure with the Russian Marker Trade, the Soho Jewelry Group, for the first time.
"The women are all exemplary and the men are all worth a power."
On Sunday night they move through the halls in clothing, two real estate mackers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, themselves and their customers as a million.
"I've looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the infinite, Mercedes and the porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the design dress that she brought, like a red teppich vetran with Joan Rivers.
The messe seemed first to go to the news, the type of mark-conscious Russian buyers that would be ready to stay a few hours in the depth to visit a fixed storehouse, which uncoveredly made Cadillac Escalades, a cup of platin, Mövenpick Eiskrem, a mixed billiards, apartments in Dubai and Gund Te's bearers.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57%).
"The Russians are interested in learning what mark is the most precious and best," said Mr. Gijarat, who was patriotically sitting at a state of the Netherlands portional manufacturer Royal Delft before a widespread imitat of a hand-made, blue mosaic stone.
"No, of course, Russian are more interested in clipper."
In fact, the traders say here that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years are based on Russian standards) have already moved from high-speaking logos to the type of nearest marks with limited track numbers that would not be in a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousands of people, whether billioners, millions, or simply tourists, were forced every day through the halls.
And buy some of them.
On the first night of the show on Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil bedten here, said that he had bought two 70,000 × mattrattensets, ornated from seed, cash and woodwool, with earned gold feet.
At the same time, in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, said that a company exempted the high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company had bought the green orange porche for 170,000€ to a Russian billion.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, said to a company who adapted Luxus cars to customer desires that he would have solved three car coal grills for a Royce Phantom Rolls that were equal to the chairs of caten arms, for each 55.000 .
He showed a reporter a car rental that was developed for a Russian casino owner with speechs he had over with colorful Swarovski cristals, so it looked like a rouleterad.
The costs: 22.000€ for a fourth.
"The Russian billionary, the street leader or a picture of his wife's face from Cubic circonium will not be able to go to these discussions," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30 or 40-wagen garage."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian Millionary" would currently not express a lot of exclusiveness in view of the increase in the price of hithern immobility.
"If you have bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already a million, at least on the paper, if you don't already have money," he said.
"There is more than those you believe."
Those who were not billionary were able to do at least as if they were rich in a position that was operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian capital management undertaking.
The company had set four red phone cells according to the British example, which were completely stopped with mountains of false million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the director of the company, said his employees would have printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millions.
Patents continued to throw the fingerprints around, mobile phone photos, while they rejected the replacement of their friends, or simply cut in a few million.
"Look, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionary," Mr. Karryev said.
Devastated operation appears in death in New Jersey
It was the day before the fertility feast as Ronald Livingston through the large glass window of Just a Little Healthier restaurants here and observed a hospital car at the white Cape Code holding two doors below the West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police officer.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw the box of their body viewer coming," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, in the midweek.
"This was the point when I knew someone was dead."
The audiences learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was a assistant of the director of the Newarker Police Neighbourhood.
Now try to find the investigators whether she died for a procedure that was carried out by an unapplied, cosmetic surgery that the police did not identify, and that in the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet discovered what Mrs Arroyo has caused death, and they are hoped that toxicological investigations whose results could not be available for weeks will help to deal with a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the Newark Police.
Mrs. Arroyo was a assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was many in the Department.
"He was loyal, hard working and hardly dealing," Mr McCarthy said about Mrs Arroyo in a telephone interview midweek.
"It was my pitbull.
She hurt me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, an ancient newarker police officer who was for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a slaughter daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a speaker for the Union County State lawyer, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the investigators would try to find whether Arroyo died as a result of an unapplied, chirurgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," Mrs. Walsh said.
"It's a running investigation."
The authorities said they had come to the house about 3 hours afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs Arroyo on a sofa.
She was explained in front of the place for death.
More than one week has passed and the authorities have notified a little about their investigation or the owner of the house listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Mrs Castro was asked by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house has been enjoyed as a medical practice.
In the middle of the week, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a black rose stream is in the foreground box and a Dalmatiner shoots behind the house.
A blue fashion labeled with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a replacement for Vanille in food and parfı - sat in the parking place near a door that led to the underground.
Two Mountainbikes hang from haken on one side.
McCarthy said that when he came to Newark for the first time, 25 years after he had spent with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of an unappreciable value and helped him to find in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"He said, 'You have to look at this or that eight," he said.
She was always here when I came here and she was always here when I went.
It was painful."
hopes that the Central Bank will reduce the rates to increase the world action markets
The shares went on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market openings that the Central Bank will try to reduce the credit markets by further rates, strengthened by the vice-president of the United States Central Bank, by reassuring comments.
The action markets increased in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the President of the Central Bank, said that the "flexible and pragmatic" must respond to the continuing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to emphasize deteriorating markets, in view of signs of increasing credit stress, Kohn said that the latest turbulences would have "in part some of the improvements in the market functions from the latest part of September and October".
If the increased turbulence remains, it would increase the possibility of further increased financial conditions for consumers and undertakings.
The comments were recorded by investors as a signal that the Central Bank is ready to enter and stabilize the credit conditions with new capital lips into the US markets and more possible rates.
The executions also helped to relax Wall Street, in view of further bad news from the United States, now since the sales of US immobility reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulences have been underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they are 650 workplaces, or 4 per cent of their worldwide employees, will be removed in a measure to reduce cost reduction to compensate serious losses from their lost laws in the US hypotechnic credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will disappear in London, where the Bank is employed by 1.500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index sprang by 331 points, or 2,55 Pro, to close at 13.289,40 while the broad-created S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 Pro.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 points, or 2,7 Pro, to close to 6.306,2, which adds more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
German Index Dax increased by 2.6 Pro and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 Pro.
Previously, the recovery of credit pressure on the markets was underlined, after a strong request to an auction of the European Central Bank's guarantees, which were granted to the European Trade Banks, was emphasised to 4.7%, the maximum rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the United States Central Bank and the European Central Bank, and further funding in the money markets in London, increased when the credit spendings were seen by the three-month "Libor" advice on the lead between the United States banks with 6,59% at its maximum since September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England conflicts with decisions on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who should be killed as number 6 for England in Candy at this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electoral president, at least under this special title, is here to be helping the Chefriner Peter Moores and Captain Michael V′han to help, and because the table of High Morries, the English Business Director, in general with requests for national electors, if not even for which parttime.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth burden position will be unfortunate, but life is often unrighteous and sport is uncertain.
It is never easy to determine exactly what a man allows to reach the top of his professional wives, while someone else never comes over the lowest range, sometimes from lack of happiness place ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the choice is difficult, where judgments are needed, always subjective.
Is it the right time to get up for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah when he does it?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young leaders with conclusions that are well known to the business.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player, unless it will be given him the opportunity to weep or weep.
Of course, numbers have a great impact on decisions, but they have chances too.
Inside a team, a cricket player needs to catch the eye of the captain at the right time when he can take a wicket and a shocker needs to get regular opportunities on the order if he wants to impress as a single cricket player.
The eyes of the electors are more complex.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who appears to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explains himself for health and how the wind goes into the network.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with each 33°s to deserve a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modesty average, but both had their points and hoped more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at the Asgiriya stadium, it can only be a viewing question.
The choice could decide both men's careers, or maybe it makes a little difference.
Four years ago, Gareth Batty played in each test and was in the first place, with five vickets and 40 useful, but it was Paul Collingwood, fighting at that time to establish it, who created the crossing to a significant test fighting player, and who, despite his double hundreds of points contrary to . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It is probably that Graveney, V日han and Moores, after a further discussion at the current network session in the Ashgriiya stadium, their conservative instincts and feelings for Shah will follow greater experience on Bopara's youth-freshness.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, he speaks of his functional and valuable 88 test debt innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is 22 years older, and a great biege against turned bottles.
But Shah only made in his two entries in May against West India in the test in Lord, his hometarina as a player from Middlesex, and this, in view of his immediate delay from the electors as V′han was healthy to return his position for the next game, seems to have taken the sweeting out-slagen, which was still manifest in Bombay.
On the contrary, the student from Essex is spectacularly enjoying life.
He was not impressed by anything on a cricket-place and his attitude was unexpectedly brought to the point when he had recently overtaken a vehicle with a quarter-radian explosion in an exhibition for England's Sponsor Volkswagen.
He takes smaller damage and proudly a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his Vodaphone (of course also sponsored) and call his team colleagues Alastair Cook, who had observed this from the remote, and said, "Have you seen it?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he turns his medium temperature with some effects here on the game fields, which seems to pass to him with confidence and confidence.
Choose the right man is a thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe this is the art of the selection.
I'm trying to give Bopara now his chance, which doesn't mean that Shah may not be good to do when, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he's the one who will play here this weekend.
Buss bring refugees back to work - and fight Al-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraq's refugees came to Bagdad yesterday, with a power of scatters whose money or visa have gone out, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some even returned to fight the rebels they had destroyed from their houses.
At Busbahnhof Mansour, even before the arrival of 800 people outcused in an official government convoi of a duzend bus, the terminal was operating with refugees and Jordan who were returned to transports.
"I decided to go after they killed many doctors in Bagdad," said Sabah Al-Qubasi, a Sunnitian Ar.
"I came back today because of what I saw in the television and what I read in the magazine, about what happened in Bagdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, in relation to the milizers of the military Cleriker Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has appointed his powers to return at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shitish teacher from the major Sunnith part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he couldn't renew his Syrian visa and because the regimen Iraker was not allowed to work.
His neighbors in Amariyah invited him to tell him that a local, supported by the United States, has come to extract Al-Qaida from their base in the west of the capital, and brought him back.
One of the newcommunists from Jordan was the leader of a Sunnith and Shitish tribe, who was destroyed from house in Sleikh in the north of Bagdad by an attack with handgranates after he invited his fellow citizens to combat Al-Qaida.
He was back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaida Milis in Sleikh and that they needed my support and my boys.
That's why I'm returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
There were stated that they had been arrested by the continuing rest of the capital city since the United States Trump and the growth of the local "groups concerned" citizens who were armed and defended their cities in collaboration with the military.
But more of the facts were to be forced home by Visa problems and insurance of money in Cus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqites were recompensed in the last years.
Salaam al-Samarai, a 51-year-old father of three times, expressed the general deceit among the exilants that Nouri al-Maliki, the schitical president of the Syrian Government, had requested to impose visibility restrictions for refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are disappointed by the sectieral mortal squadrons in the country.
"We went well to visit al-Maliki, and the government forced Iraqi to give no vision anymore to force them back to Iraq," said the Sunnite Rentner.
"I can't trust a government supporting the criminals who burned my house after I left."
A part of the reason for the decrease of violence is that Sunnites were destroyed from skitical residence areas and around, which led to the creation of many places where spendings were left.
There are promises that a sudden stream of refugees will resume sectieral spending and will come to conflicts.
Small Saarland, Education
The smallest Federal Country is leading to professional training and even clearly with the international orientation of its high schools.
Only in a educational field, the Saar countries have the same detitude as the country.
"I've said yesterday to 50 times a non-Saarland that we're not French" -- this Slogan places the smallest country selfironically to 50. Birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a great role in Saarland's educational system, which is located in the educational monitor of the German Economy Institute of Köln (IW).
In this way, high schools are already cooperating closely with the neighborhood countries.
The University in Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, those who are here can end her room with a double or even threefold diploma.
Therefore, the share of foreign farmers is high with 15,6 Pro.
However, the landscape also brings Saarland to the high schools in an overall number - many of them without a conclusion in the Gymnasium.
"In Saarland you are using the powerful education system," says Axel Plünnecke, IW educational experts.
More than every fifth youth will have its rights on a professional school, so that Saarland is more than seven prospective points over the average community.
In addition, the combination opportunities of professional and academic training are strongly developed.
As regards the population number, the compensation with dual steps is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increased request, however, the number of engineerabounders in the past years has been decreased by a third.
Therefore, the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed high schools to a marketing campaign for engineering scientists.
"We have made several reforms after the first Pisa study," says a speaker of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the Government has conducted a comparative test throughout the country.
In order to begin the children to learn early, the last year of China is free of charge - a model that, inter alia, copys other federal countries.
If the performances of the students are sustainablely improved, future comparative studies will only be shown.
At Pisa 2003, the share of risk students increased from 29 to 20 Pro.
However, in total, Saarland did not increase as strong as other federal countries.
The Bayers are thinking better.
And for the sake of the Saar countries, foreign ideas in Pisa will not be taken into account -- in this area, it could be otherwise points.
Because the language of the neighbors is obligation to Gymnasia - even if the Saar countries are not French.
Chavez converts the hours
In Venezuela, the hours are deeply different than in the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez allows the timemakers to return in the South America country about a half hours.
In Spain, Chavez will therefore be a witzfigure.
As reported by the Office of Venezuela, according to a new law, the hours will be set at the world time at minus four and half hours.
This is how the South America state has a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
The U.S. Enemy Chavez based his decision, among other things, in order to the United States of the world had set up the department in time zones at full hours.
In addition, Chavez announced the interruption of relations with the neighborhood Cookie on Middleweek (Location Time).
As long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Ko Papayi, he will not be discussed with the leader of the State or with the Co-government.
"I can't do this alone because of my worth," said Chávez, which is a constitutional reform forward to which the citizens of Oilland must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would clearly develop his power in the country.
The disruptor of the dispute was the decision of Uribes to remove the mandate for negotiations with marxistic rebellion in Copenhagen, in which it was about the release of age.
Uribe had been criticized on Sunday with his decision "in the face," Chavez had criticized.
Also in Spain is Chavez in all the world.
A new phone-klingelton provides in the country for Furore: "Why no te callas" (Why don't you keep the mouth) is the term that has already downloaded more than half million people from the Internet.
Spanish King Juan Carlos, who was generated on the latest Ibero-American pipe of the constant intermediate of the linker and was running through the mouth.
Germany threatened 2007 loan mins
Despite the strong conjuncture, German workers threatened a prognoses this year to lose real wages.
Experts called a whole bond of reasons for their pessimistic predicts.
According to the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees in 2007 could actually consider less on the content account than in the previous year.
"There is the modesty payment development, the increase in additional taxation and the prices of food and energy," Gustav Horn said from the Institute for Macroeconomy and Conjunction Research of the "image" citizen.
New charges may also be made to workless insurance on employees.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Journal", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 Pro for the annual exchange is right and reasonable in the present situation.
However, the Federal Agency for Work should not return to the opportunity to ask for credits or adjudications on the band, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Wednesday, the price explosion was stated in Nah resources and mineral oil products has increased the inflation rate at the maximum level of 13 years.
The prices in total increased by 3.0 Pro.
Venus is the hectic dulling of the earth
The Venus, despite its vital enemy atmosphere of the earth, is more similar than so far: The space safe "Venus Express" has discovered in the atmosphere and the wind whirl on the Poland, as it appears in the winter also on the earth.
Since almost three years, the communists believed that it was on the Venus.
Now the Sunde "Venus Express" has shown the evidence - she looked at electromagnetic whales at the border of the atmosphere: The wines shot on the Venus in a height of about 56 km from the cloud to the cloud, Christopher Russel reports from the of California in Los Angeles in the Family magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen Theory" they have allowed the life on the earth to be raised: wheat should have made reactions in the Ocean leading to the creation of amino acids, the building stones of life.
Not so on the Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," said Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there may be almost something living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about 100 times closer than on earth, it is under temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil's whilling of the earth, but it's a twilling," Russell said.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, has affected such a completely different development, is the basic question of Esa mission.
The beginning of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milenstein for Venus Research, since since the beginning of the nine years, there was no sond to investigate this planet.
The latest research results presented in several "nature" articles are not only the uniqueness of the Venus within the sun system, according to the researchers.
"They also show that the communities of our neighbor's planet with the earth are greater than too accepted," shares Esa.
Thus, the researchers found a cloud stream on the southern pool, which is still more faster in the northern pool.
The phénomen refers to air flows on the earthly winterhemisphere, writes a research team on Giuseppe Pi ́oni from the Italian isituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second tenth planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is nearly the same size with a diameter of 12.100 km.
The plane also covered as the morning or evening stars is about about 225 days around the sun.
But he turns much slower around himself: a Venus day lasts 243 days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees of Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar is shortly mentioned on the earth, the community seems that both planets have occurred under very similar conditions.
On both sides, water that remained on earth in oceans, but on Venus was lost in the world room.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on the earth in carbon stones, it produces the majority of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Coaler defends marks meetings with Dalai Lama
President-in-Office Köhler requires the end of the party fight for the receipt of Dalai Lama at the office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD because of their attacks on the officer after the meeting in September.
President-in-Office Horst Köhler is concerned about the view of Germany and has invited the great coalition to end the fight for the receipt of Dalai Lama.
"We should not present the foreign world in this matter a separate nation," Kohler said to the trade paper.
At the same time, Kohler understanding for the receipt of Dalai Lama by the Federal Conzler Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the subdividence of cultures," Koler said.
Everyone knows that Germany needs to make sensitive balances in the foreign policy, the President of the Federal President stressed, but the marks were protected from the proposal that it operated a new Chinese policy.
"The federal cancer has not taken away from the traditional in-Chinese policy.
It also knows China," said Cooler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had expressed indirect inmutation on the receipt of Dalai Lama and therefore had been attacked by a series of Unions.
The Steinmeer, among others, complained the Union's "creativity policy" in the external policy.
After the receipt of Dalai Lamas at the office, there was an irritation in German-Chinese.
Thus, the Chinese leader not only invited the German Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but also frozened the so-called dialogue of the foreign ministers of both countries, after information from the SPIEGEL.
China's Governing Boss Wen Jiabao has now invited the Federal Cancer Angela Merkel to make the receipt of Dalai Lamas a mistake.
China refuses to reject the receipt of more in official function of the Tibetan religious leader, confirmed Wen Jibao the Chinese position.
The acts and words of Dalai Lamas showed that he tried to remove Tibet and the other Tibet region, including other today's provinces, from China.
Sheuble warns against crafts like in France
Road battles with the police, shoes, burning cars: Wolfgang Schuble warns against crafts like in France.
It is necessary to do everything so that social insatisfyment in Germany does not deal with violence on the street, the Federal Ministry requested.
Barrikads, Randaliers shot the police with shoot flints: after the severe youth crafts in France, the Federal Minister Wolfgang Schöuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must take care of that we do not build social sprays and deal with violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" appearing in Hannover.
Not every young man is able to make a quick change in social reality.
Conferences, countries and communities have already been emphasised to rebuild problems, said Sheuble.
This is not only the integration of migrants.
"From the integration gospel to the Islam Conference, the first success is already shown."
However, it is too early for warning.
Sheuble also pointed out that in German preventions there are no state-building and social problems like in France.
In north of Paris's forests, youths have delivered severe road battles with the police last night.
Even in Toulouse cars and public buildings.
Greater integration efforts of the Federal Government requested the president of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the Krawal in France, Kolat warned against "effecting effects".
However, the situation in Germany is not as brisant as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the rate of unemployment in youths with migration background under 25 years is "average high".
In particular, it must be provided for more training plants.
Kolat stressed: "We have to give youths a perspective."
The president of the Turkish community, however, adds: in Germany, there is more than in France "a social control in the families".
In addition, youths with migration background did not want to deal with what their parents built here.
Kolat said, "But we must be careful."
Young people have to give the opportunity to participate in work and training.
In the meantime, it remained awesome in the Parisian front of Villiers-le-Bel at night.
Hundreds of the police were in use, and a screwman overflowed the area with swine.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning M'ems and cars.
Since earlier, a offer of approximately 1000 security forces provide for rest.
The police will pass as long as it is necessary, Mr Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after an advocate in the city.
On Wednesday night, in Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 cops were hurt.
Consequently, the injuries overcome toulouse.
The Krawals were inflammated by a disaster in which two young people had died on Sunday.
According to the first recognition of the state advocate, the police is not guilty of the death of young people.
In the kingdom of Angela wolke
The reality remote occurrence of the cancer evidences that the coalition is in content - and that it does not expect anything to be expected from herself.
In what country is this federal cancer?
After his unconfortable occurrence in the general debate of the covenant, which was a reasonable and content weapons, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should be finally governed by it.
The proposal that it could be too much to the external policy has rejected Angela Merkel with an arguous exciting term.
It is provincial, said she and showed that she wouldn't understand what the critics were doing.
On the Day of Judgment, it has documented all recognizable how much their proposal is matched.
There was no particular interest or feeling of the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela clouds were presented: a retreated woman who flees into the foreign policy and even remains there in an inconvenience.
Example of climate protection: Since they are uninterrupted for the decisions of sanctuary damm, but they do not say how the climate goals should be achieved.
At all, the self-lob - so much insensitivity would have disappointed the CDU Chaffin two years ago.
Now she's deceived to the floods that the surprise comes to people.
In this way, she protects her image as Prague, the problems, rather than the world's beauty.
But in the kingdom of Angela clouds, in the political problems are a random appearance.
Children's worries and concerns?
It has a few sides left for it.
It's fascinating how often it promises when it's about the child's adoption.
Three attacks needed marks to make a semi-way right set.
She's crazy as on an alien terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attacke Department
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidency candidates, both preferred Rudy Giuliani and the middle of Romney have to make a hard shift - and now have to fear a foreign candidate.
The effort of candidates is already at the first point.
He has made New York to a "local location for illegal immigrants" and has proposed his contrary Rudy Giuliani in the middle of Romney.
This counterpart of his side with hard proposals: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegale," Giuliani encountered and suggested the former governor of Massachusetts to have a private immigrant without paper.
The candidates blame about the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favourites, the eight presidential advisers use the debate on CNN, especially to discred their opposers.
The 30-second videos who have sent the Internet users via YouTube are almost more than accommodators.
"With this kind of isolamus we have allowed Hitler to come to the power," suggests John McCain's contrary Ron Paul, who is the only one in that demands a immediate department from Iraq.
Also, Romney is obtained by the Vietnamian Veterrans strongly leaving the Levites when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", a method of hearing that is simulated in the drinks to condemn as folter.
However, the important topics of the campaign between the part of Iraq war and foot debates show the reactions of the Salary Republic in St. Petersburg in Florida.
When preservative values and future tax increases are rejected, it is burned in the auditorium.
This shows more once, where the weaknesses of the two favorites are.
"I've been wrong at that time," said Romney sneakingly and putting it before the base and television public for the end of 1994 to be part of the deployment of the tenders.
Yet, Giuliani comes into the slinger when he thinks that he is asked about the literal explanation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civilians
One day after the retraction of the army, the Pakistanian Machthaber Musharraf has been violated as president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's president Pervez Musharraf was arrested on Thursday for another five years of office.
The Pakistanian TV overcame the ceremonie in the presidential palace of the main city of Islamabad.
Musharraf sweared to respect the Constitution and to act for the goodness of the nation.
In the middle of the week, he had transferred his office as military office to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his master's arrest in an unblooded military powder, the former general is now first governing as civil ruler.
With retreat as the super-commanded host of the forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a nuclear requirement of opposition and west.
Another central requirement is the end of the exception that Musharraf had devoted on 3 November.
Soon after his obstacle, Musharraf will, according to General State lawyer Malik Muhammad Qayum, cancel the state of exception and thus comply with a further requirement of the West.
The Court of Justice of the country, after the derogation of the exemption at the beginning of November, officials with him, rejected all commitments against the dispute of the Governing Boss on 6 October.
In the northern tribe region of North-Wazstan, five soldiers were killed by an attack on a military convoi and four other damages.
According to a military speaker, the bomb exploded on a street near the border of Afghanistan.
Return the fathers of the Krautrock
The German Supergroup of the Seven-Ziggers is musical again: the three band members of Harmonia took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
To Revival, a average of its big time "Live 1974".
At that time, they were most famous in the foreign country.
The conscious sensation then occurs in the form of three lords set at the evening table.
Everyone has his boxes before himself, his cable, and especially his buttons.
Dieter Moebius thront in the blue white heat with 63 years in the middle.
Links floated by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by laptop and gitarre.
Right, considered by the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, can't be at the console.
Everyone plays sounds, including even a boat.
And sometimes it's deceived to a common part of music.
This does not seem to be great to the lords themselves.
That the band of Harmonia re-music has provided some exciting under Krautrock lovers.
When you can enthone here: Got questions showed that the name was swearing by the collective pop memory, but no way so sustainable to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should the German not celebrate his living legends from the seven cigarettes?
At the same time, what it calls irrelevant Krautrock, in England and America is always more than in its own country.
When the music economy delivered the survivors of the Kölner Group Can 2003 the echo price for lifework, there was a questioning German pop viewer in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers were thanked in Laudatio at the Bands La Düsseldorf and New!, the surprise knew no limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later grew up at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home, and the defense in the foreign is one.
Thus, the memory has already been transferred to Harmonia because the Trio was only two years old and at this time had a far less efficiency power than they had been assigned to others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already musiced with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the many promised name Cluster.
At the same time, we were playing under the Berlin School.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for one of the church's platform labels.
Rother had recently helped in powerwork and then as a gitarist at New!, who may be the most radical German group, played a call at that time.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster Mouse in Exil to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the ancient Westernhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as a cityflying communist.
Less ideologically than in the commune I, where Roedelius had to be wounded as a child.
Before in an artist's awesome.
In the lock, there was also a wave of the Armonia Ottenstein conference and a name for the art.
Some have kept the Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "The Luxe".
Because so leave and humble music also sounds, the band little material need.
The road collection served not only of self-finding.
The now apparent CD "Live 1974" was cut in a concert in grise, before a nearly 50-cooked records, as someone believes to learn.
From Rother, the desire to force Harmonia and sometimes exercise.
For Roedelius and Moebius, an unsettled request.
The band explained its trend in 1975.
Rother landed in Esotherian Spheric and safeguarded his existence with albums like "flaming hearts".
Cluster has been rebuilt in the eighth centuries and has been more than Harmonia has ever been.
The Greenest Live Album is to thank Herbert Greenmeyer.
His plateform Greenland has aimed to promote the crautrock as an increasing German contribution to living music.
New! has already been buried like Roedelius Solowork.
The physical recovery of Harmonia is located in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subvented under the Woldtronic Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and Manufacturer of the handbook "Kruutrock Sampler".
There's also the Love Parade finder Dr. Motte.
The entire band width of the impact of the crawl rock would turn on the following pop music.
Harmonia is entitled to the supergroup's space.
The set of Brian Eno weeps with the most disgusting sounds in the room: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures showing the product's harmonia in the building level.
Legend training serves projections of additional black-white photos of wire-constructed equipment.
Before this, the three veterans are recovered with improvisation.
No more by closing microphones to the orchard and to the shock to remove the instruments of unhearted sounds based on self-based efficiency devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technical deeper.
This does not change the Chor of the House.
Under the leading Barbara morning stars, the sun clouds are bound and sing at a beautiful place with the emphase "Aaaaaaaah!"
Crautrock was always a very English term.
It was never Rock.
The roots were searched less in blue than in musical schools (Can), technology (croftwork) or in the fleeting from artificial and social conventions (Cluster).
Who calls "'68!" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia doesn't allow it to get out of the rest.
The most self-comprehensible is also based on the stage.
Where's music starting and who's going to stop?
This can protect one the nerves or flighting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not genuine enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "The Mordern Peace" two films with the Balkan war again.
But they both don't convince.
Or the concepts set too much on action and packaging or they are too anxious.
Richard Gere can't help in the Hunting Party.
The first message: as the war crimes of Karadzic and Mladic are hidden still in the mountains of the Balkan, but calculated there, in the dark territory of the Bosnian war, the spectator Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost the most beautiful man of the eighth Years recently because too many net-beep roles in women's well-being films and too many press conferences on Buddhism one had the pleasure to view.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - When the jailer becomes jailed" (Why must film title today always be as long and nice as the lottery contracts?) maybe to look at.
He provides a wonderful eyewitching presentation: In fact, his war reporter Simon Hunt has been taken what could be from the wheel if the shick and the film industry were not so favorable: a man who has had his best time behind himself, but who has saved himself as a ruinous memory of his decline or a significant remnant of the unique charm.
But despite this Trumpes, "The Hunting Party" with the German production of "Murder Peace", which also starts in this week, only the endless series of Balkan War films failed.
With "Morder Peace" you can make a short process: the movie is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian from cosovarian hackens, and who is still in the same place.
Although it is valuable that not even here the Serbs are displayed as only roots of all evils, the television floor is lost too quickly in packaging and action.
There remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a carway but with war.
However, "The Hunting Party" is able to examine exactly why it has never given a good Balkan war movie.
The story of three US war reporters that open to see the Serbian Super War crimes "the Fuchs" could have been able to become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with a different director and a different trigger (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard) at a different time.
Because the stories are similarly striking: both times small teams go into the forest to do something that the military people cannot, and both times it will be a trip into the foolish sense.
One of the reasons for the "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply allowing the devastated cyniker to be with heart when he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must still inspire a romantic business with a later murdered muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the river when the reporters in the last five minutes in the time traveling procedure did not create that Nato, and all the world's headends in five years: the war crimes were captured and left the Muslim Bosnians in justice.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court Boss in the Hague for crime against the Chinese.
The movie has a deepest human attachment.
He wants to appreciate that Karadzic and Mladic are still running freely, and he condemns the Americans and the French (his should be exclusively agreed) to perform persecution because of secret political deficiencies.
But the good congregation and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous boarding story comes into mind.
It refers to the wood mask of a Asian demon on the devil's work table: "I feel compassionately see the sturnads, andeu: how effortful it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swimming heads, but reflect how effortful it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan War movie.
Recently, this magazine has reported that all Iraq films of Hollywood were big flops.
You can add: It has never given a good South African movie.
Almost always applies: If a star is running on the world's crisis herds or mine fields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with ́o DiCaprio.
Perhaps all conflicts are too simple at time.
They always had to go a year before Hollywood could turn a good movie over the holocaust with the "Schindler's list".
Some films are still going to be kidnapped - which now as classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have no longer been unhealthy as master works.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder comes at the same two screens, even too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that makes the letters to the literature the insensitivity that it needed to tell stories.
"He or nonseen" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good because Lubits and Chaplin did not know how bad the Nazi regime was actually dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcasmly distant artistic view of Romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When the historical Roman "Lemprière's dictionary" and the Balkan war was asked, he answered: "This is only that some things never change.
Great cities will always be terrible, people will always be killed in a cruel way and will always rule war in Yugoslavia."
By Best Critics for Olympia's Abstract
The depreciation of the citizen's master from Hamburg's request for Olympical Sommer Games has been thrown into violent criticism.
Others want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
However, by beast, realism is encouraged to evaluate the opportunities.
The Chairman of the Hamburg Chamber, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, held a delay in the midweek as "not good for the economic position".
No other project has recently developed so much motivation forces in the city as the olympiadee.
"Unless this goal, sport policy would not be able to maintain at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to finish the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "the resulting from a changed timeline".
Citizen Ole of Beust remained in the middle of previous statements, whereby Hamburg's olympics were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides about an olympical accusation, but the German Olympical Sportbund," said by Beust WE ONLINE.
He referred to the expected decision of the Sport Bond on a request for the winter games 2018.
"This preference means for us that we will not have realistic chances in the period that we have before 2028."
However, if the dream is not always dreamed, he said of Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) suffered the statements of Beusts.
This will result in the impression that Hamburg doesn't want to complain for olympical games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to disappoint a chance by preparing the plans at this time," President HSB Günter Ploß on midweek said.
A delay on the application is also in the opposite statement of the Senate Chair of the General German High School Conference.
There, by Beust, Hamburg's request for the University 2015 "not as a replacement" for Olympics games in Hamburg.
The high school sports association had just nominated Hamburg as a candidate in the last week.
The SPD citizenship group proposed to the Senate to have a valuable time for the building of apartment in Hamburg.
"The development of the small grassbrook has been delayed by the senate for years because he set on the map of Olympia and has deployed the apartment building," said SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quist.
Since the SPD for the small grassbrook always requested an integrated planning for Olympia and a later use, the CDU set on the "Event Factory".
The request for the Olympical Sommer Games 2012 had made a great pleasure in Hamburg at his time.
However, Hamburg failed to Leipzig.
That's not Warhol's boxes
Who connects the terms of Sweden and wood boxes, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently, made wood boxes cast dark shadows on Warhols Working List.
A majority of the nineteen brillo boxes listed in "Type Stockholm" are false.
After the Swedish magazine "Express" a few months ago doubts about the reality of Andy Warhols Brillo-boxes of 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now come to a refreshing result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which was the former Museum Director Pontus Hultén the Moderna Museet 1995 as a provision, are copies - and the majority of about 100 other brillo boxes from "Type Stockholm", which are on the international art.
The story is deceived, a confusion of artificial and curatoric production.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "brillo-boxes" in New York, drawing wood boxes based on the red-blau-white design of the paper cards of the brillo powder "Brillo".
A exhibition of his work in the Moderna Museet 1968 - with Warhols consciousness - issued hundreds of brillo-castes from paper: These were not from Warhol, but directly delivered from the Brillo Carton Factory.
It was not artificial works, but their examples for just exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol 1968 has certainly granted the authorisation to allow some small brillo-holz boxes to produce in Sweden, however not issued in the modern Museum.
The newspapers now speak about about five boxes that at that time as authorised original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo boxes with the name "Type Stockholm" have been introduced right into the art and auction history.
Some of them have reached more than 100 000 people on auctions.
The problem is now that the Legendary Museum Director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it was produced in Sweden about 100 wood boxes, which then left Warhol.
In fact, Hultens 105 boxes were produced in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg before 1990.
Warhol was dead at that time for three years.
Lars Byström, the Chief Conservator at Moderna Museet, has also examined three of the six Museum Brillo Boxes of Swedish ownership, from which two of them were produced in Stockholm in 1968: their press span plates were first based and split, then white oil colour was opened with a pince.
However, the structure of the copys from 1990 suggests that the colour with a painer roll was opened directly on the press span plate - it is also not the oil, but the acryl colour.
"These boxes were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-boxes," the director of the Modern Museet, Lars Nittve, said: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York doesn't come to another box, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/output material."
In July, the Authentication Board announced freely to follow the "deep accusations" which will be raised in the cases of the powder powder.
Yet, since there is an immortal weakness.
