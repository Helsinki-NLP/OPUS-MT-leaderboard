The stars distinguish the light and heat because the combination of the water atomes to be performed with the elements of the energy generated by the combination of (slue) water atomes.
Scientists are aimed at creating reactions that are able to enhance energy in the same way.
However, this is extremely difficult to resolve the problem, and the benefits of the synthesis reaction will be seen only after many years.
The surface of the water is flooded because of the surface’s intention.
The surface’s attempt occurs because the water molecules on the surface of the water are trained much stronger than the air molecules above them.
The water molecule on the surface of water constitutes an invisible film that causes the steel to flood on the surface of water.

In order to return the earlier energy parts, they must decrease the additional energy obtained from the light.
They do this by spreading a small part of the light, called the photo.
The scientists call this process "in the light spindellow" because the connected light stimulates the atomes, thus photonails spread up and light is a type of spindelation.
In the next image, photos are pictured by atomic spinding. Of course, photons are actually much less than the image.
Photons are even less than parts containing atomes!
