DFB Chief Grindel does not see the foundation for Uzil Comeback
Mr Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel has no foundation for a return of Mesut Özil to the national community.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on the fact that once you're talking to him about why he's obviously felt that one or another as statement is put down," Grendel said in the football postcast "Phrasenmar" of the "Phrasen-Cetting.
Despite the current monthly debate on the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan, he deteriorates the reception of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been glad if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I've also expired until a certain time that it would be, said Grindel.
In July, the 29-year-old had explained his departure from the DFB team and also founded that Grindel did not defend him against racism enemies during the WM.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism to Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Bundestra; Joachim Löw and Team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it out of the football so that if "man leaves a man or changes a union that you speak about it with Tra > and I feel damage that this talk has not been stated until now."
Linz: Gardenhouse in Shreberg species
At 14.13 p.m., the professional firewater Linz was alarmed to a fire in the hallway.
Since a high-speaking guide directly leads to the horror site, it was moved.
The professional firewater was exhausted and found the tent in full fire when it arrived.
The cook was practically to be removed and the burning shot was cleared in the measure necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden, he had a battery to load at midnight.
Maybe that's the burning case.
Anyway, the loading device was as a firewall in the area of the largest burntness.
The damage that has occurred by the fire must be detected - as well as the burning case.
However, he may be significant because the owner had many collectors in his garden house.

"The Diel Taskforce still exists," Peter Mertens' development project said to the "Auto Way".
The arrested and authorised Audi Chairman Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the taskforce would be solved soon.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engines/works combined were probably checked," he said at that time.
Mertens now said, "We have achieved a important step objective in the processing of the diet crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was established in September 2015 after the discovery of the diet candal at the Audi-Mother Peoples Car.
Mertens stressed that the autobuilder had made "gravating organizational changes" so that such a scandale would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had made a decision on the future of Stadler on Friday and would like to continue to discuss this Sunday.
The investigators propose to the Audi Chairman that, after the notification of the exhausts, they authorise the sale of dieluutos with false gases.
He knew about the manipule or ignored it consciously.

Griddel street reelecting - Lahm should be in DFB president
In spite of the criticism of his person after the WM output and the Özil business in the next year, Reinhard Grindel wants to candidate to the office as President of DFB.
"I'm doing my work and trying to do it as well as it's going," Grindel said as a guest on the early Sunday morning in the "current sports studio" of ZDF.
You must always try again to reelect, I'll do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The boss of the curse found it "wonderful" according to his own words if he did not "will have to cooperate with the future project" after the proposal for the football EM 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the Foreign Boss as follower of the Wolfgang Niersbach broke through the Sommermark business.
In Tuesday 2016, he was chosen for the first complete official period of three years.
The next vote is held at the DFB Fountain Day on 27 September 2019.
The future EM-Cheef Philipp Lahm is to cooperate with Grindel in the DFB Presidency.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues agreed in the Presidency that he was also in the president's future consultation, and then he was, of course, invited to provide his experience in sports issues," said Grindel.
In specule, if Lahm could be his follower as DFB head, he would not share himself.
As a consequence of the business about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish president, Recept Tayip Erdogan expressed the desire to become a national player without the migration background of the DFB integration boats.
Currently, this office of Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic is exercised, and the last has radiational roots in Camerun.
"If one without migration background is clearly influenced by the society and the football and says, "the subject is important, we must take care of it," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our units in the area where integration must work," said Grindel.

Also muscle and bone mass can show it.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is better for the worst.
He doesn't say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscles.

The New Yorker police and the musician Chris Martin, however, took the people away from the stage.

Freedom of press: Federal Government defends the journalist's output
Governing speaker Steffen Seibert defended the output of a journalist from the press conference of Kanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) and the Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the office, the Turkish journalist who lived in Hamburg had translated a T-shirt with the Turkish and German record "Freeness for Journalists" and had passed into the first series.
The T-shirt, if it wasn't the problem, said Sebert the picture on Sunday.
It was a delay of the end of the press conference.
The work of the journalist has occurred a strong insult, which is not acceptable.
That's why he's allowed the person to bring the man out.
Shebert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political advice at press conferences at the Federal Conference.
This applies fully independently of whether it is a justified claim.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
They shall provide regular spionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gulen movement.
The Turkish leader makes the movement for the failing puzzle trial on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threatened several years of prison.
In addition, foreign journalists are not secure before the Turkish authorities: First of September the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
The cases of the arrested journalists Meshale Tolu and Deniz Yücel were providing attention.
Although they were free and able to return to Germany, there are still processes in Turkey against both.
München: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Mıer
So fresh and well-speaking knows his fans usually: Florian David Fitz.
There's two times to look at: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular shooter was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow produced by the NDR "In the night" is for the theke of the Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfish posts".
Moderatorin Ina MÃer spends with his guests on some beer, some wine or even higher trees to block the voice and tongues.
Not few promises are also able to drink courage for the obligations of anxiety.
On Friday, another result of the popular Talkshow was opened.
This time: the Florian David Fitz player from films such as "Men's herds", "Terror - your judgment" or "The Gulden Day".
The Münchner had the flight to the high north, but it wasn't good.
On Saturday, he posted a selfe - his face is completely cut off, the eyes are only two small shirts.
The bed-selfie shows a completely equipped Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he has only a powerful catcher.
To his fans he posted some - of course not very serious - knowledge that he now has won: "Regulation one: doesn't go to Inas night.
Rule second: never drinks the black sau.
And Spritz.
And the egg liquor, the ina mixs about half three, lets it go.
The alcohol consumption is actually written to the 43-year-old.
His fans just posted a few tips to combat the consequences.
They carry out instant breads, fish breads, or - deceited at the most target - head pain tablets.
Others simply wondered about the view of the usually attractive kinosar.
As Ina M ́er has overcome the nightly surface, it is not yet.
Since she has moderated the TV space at the Theke, but since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be clearly tested...
On a beer with Ina Mâer.
Treysa has to fight vandalism and unrace
The entrance in the 36 kilometers long road road in the red captain country in Treysa is severely detectable and formed.
Recepts against the grassing vandalism are searched, but solutions are shortly delayed.
Swarms, cigarettes kips, Mı and Unrat, demolate MÃ©s and average demounted notices - thus presents since the length of the entrance with a group of seats to the roadway on the Haaste wheel in Treysa.
For the preview object, the road road road in the red captain country is more than an unreligious view.
The subject is employed by members of the ADFC location group Schwalmstadt, but others are already longer, as the town's radio traffic officer Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been discussed in the Radiation Board.
Don't give a solution until now.
The proposals arise from the settlement group to regular depreciation of waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entrance.
"I think the last thing would be the command of the hour - independent of any more possible A's," says the deserthagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the subject was also introduced into the local office.
Not only the M.330 Radiators and residents - the seat group is at the end of weeks a regular meeting point for celebration.
It is not only often sound, it is also deteriorated by the ships: the rocks of the earth, the democracy of Mâmer, the shields around, the seat mobs.
Volunteers had already cleared more often, told ADFC-Mitglied Susanne Klippert.
However, the actions are only the speechful troops on the heat stone.
They worry that the rash place is on the road road in Treysa matching point for swimming.
"For all the roadway there is clearly the top point of the Haaste wheel," the radio carrier, who now takes care of the new raw places in goats that are opened today.
"It'll be the same shick sal, it'll be pretty dumb."
Another idea is a video monitoring at the hill: "It may be that that makes the swell clear to get to the meeting.
However, this would be expected that there will be nearly a police officer.
Basically, the deserthagen wants a development of the Haaste wheel.
He must be made more attractive.
In fact, with the frequency of the road, you can be very satisfied.
The tourist confusion is still exhaustive.
Our roadway is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," as the ADFC members.
As a very critical body, ADFC-Mitglied Susanne appreciates the situation in the Ascherood Street in Treysa.
There's no trail on the Haaste-high.
In King Ver_ it can be able to wait at the middle of the road between both sides of the stream," she states.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for elders and especially for children.
Music Contest in the Cultural Travel Hof: The "Ko of Hiltrup" and the sea
The first call to music was a success, creative, and together.
"D to offer a song for helprup" is the call of the town shareful helprup, in "Music for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eye whispers in the sympathic helper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a coffee and cooks of the cultural train officers.
Seven forms attended, from the one-man-band to the great En日: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with gitarre, Rolf Ihmig, a long in the Hiltrup of living albums, the nine of the "Hiltroper star colors", three members and three generations of the families Trencamp and ́us, an enège from the child garden Lummerland and s ́ Rike Weßling and the black.
This Contest, as Joachim Schmidt explained, was a new news.
We haven't learned that in other cities.
What were the textures connected to?
In the places, the Hiltropper See and the market numbers were particularly often found increasing.
Rolf Ihmig shorted all the shocking song to "Koo of Hiltrup".
Moreover, the Cultural Travel Hof was assessed.
It was always about experience in these places, especially in Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke introduced the short rebuilding outputs with short interviews with the interprets or indications to their creation.
So it was learned from Humberg that he studied chemicals, but now he taught guitars.
From the tonechniker Stefan Schemmelmann, Frank knew that the youngest occurred in Ludwigshafen - on a large event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic placed all this on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Frank said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the helper gastronomy.
For the favorites of the jury, however, there was something that could be able to hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianoist Marcel Untied with a tone technic shammelman.
Other musicians can play a song: Ihmig with Hiltrup Schooler, who especially impressed Frank with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful attack" with children and two exhibitors of gitarre and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina T.
Like all, the children came up to the end again - and even laughed without electronic support "truely well", as Frank said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to helprup, accessibility of the melodie and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the West False School for Music, Andreas Klomphaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Agreement, as well as Jan Kaven, president of the town-participant.
The citizen's shareholder called the event on the basis of its annual existence.
She appreciated the event as a full success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" soon in a very full cross-border.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that opposite each other.
For each side, there is a screen with four cards with keywords that man - the old trick with the red transparency - can only decifrate when you have entered them.
In this way, it is ensured that the opposite can also not read anything from disappointment.
Then on the cards, for example, read from left to right: "• Renaissance.
Window 2.
Three worms.
4. Fest."
These are the terms which it should be encrypted.
Because the terms are not being delivered here, but codes.
Switching a player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card on which "3.4.2".
They should not be delivered in "Decrypto" the terms behind the secret folle, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He wants - in this order and in this example - to describe the terms "Worpels", "Fest" and "Windows" - and so that his own team recognises the correct order and the genetic team is not as soon as possible; because it wins the party when it gets him to break the code two times.
So the encryptor notes and reads accordingly: "Worp" for the worms, "Lose" as opposite to the fest; of course there would also be something like "Party" and "Prag" because he has passed in the school and knows the window turbulence.
That's what's going on for the team, team for the team.
Although you don't know the terms of the opposite -- but it can be better assembled with any indication that the encryptor gives it.
If mysterious, but not to turn back, the rescriptions should therefore be, elsewhere, it is unnecessary to make it difficult to team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic of "Decrypto" is the rule.
The players must probably study it quite long and completely until they can finally play.
The description video under decrypto.info on the network makes it easier.
But whoever has solved the first time will be fascinated how much feeling is in this invisible game.
But at all, "Decrypto" is not very closely as the predecessors and Genre-Primus "Codenames", which also puts an agent thee on a game smaller words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever is just about advice and not about victory points, it can also easily find a version for two.
Kulbach: Man shows the police Hitler grace and disappoints guests in the kneipe
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulbach at the night of Saturday on Sunday.
First, he showed in the top town of a passenger police officer the Hitler Great, and later he also fell in the top town in a knife when he embraced other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to carry the night in the police inspection Kulbach in the prison cell.
In the nearest state, he must also be responsible for the use of characteristics of constitutional injury organizations.
Operational work Pressig was home of the Schubloks
The training work in Pressig was a year’s turnover in Frankenwald.
1991, a part of railway history ended.
"When the puffer was knipped on the puffer, it was heard in complete pressure," mentioned George Dinkel, who's the story of the place and the bathroom.
Nobody's driving it up.
There the brems were still, and the wagons were stuck.
That was just a clean railway.
Explanations that are sensible for Dinkels home Pressig.
Nowhere in Frankenwald, a place was thus spread by the railways.
Here was the beginning of the strike-back streams to the north, which has a increase of approximately 220 metres of highlight in the woods.
To order this, early trains and shopping blocks were needed to have their home in pressure.
1901 the Bayer landscape approved the building of a train worker with 21 lockshops, training jobs, driving and training facilities.
"Herzstick was the ship, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a rebuilding in 1899," said Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, Bahnhistoric and 47 years of profession.
From the training work (BW) Pressig submitted to Bamberg in 1968, locks were also carried out for the understreck Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Northern sides.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblad" reported from a 160-man station; 13 damps and eight Elloks were stationed at the time in Pressig.
Electricisation of the stream 1939 has already minimised the need for trains and shopping.
Since 1977, they were only used to carry out goods.
By 1991, at least 10 000 weights were organized in the month.
1982, parts of the operational work, 1991, were canceled.
Heidrich: "It's suspect that you don't have a better use of the location, including in pointo transport, in the eye."
On Pennsylvania 1989, the Nürnberg Travel Direction celebrated the "50 years of electricity Nürnberg - Saalfeld" a pompous bathroom fest in Pressig.
"There were 10 000 amazing viewers here," mentioned George Dinkel.
It's a little bit later.
On 1 June 1991 the last 30 men were discharged, the Rangier Road Hof Pressig was a story.
"The rangers and hammers performed the most difficult work in the traffic," says Dinkel.
Each failure would have had fatal consequences.
Why the trainhof Pressig-Rothen Church has led to the surrounding of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current images there are in the infrankPlus articles.
Kerber with success in China Open

21 Exemplars of 20 artists are now to be reviewed in the middle of honor.
Mr. Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists for the exhibition of the disappointment.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as the main artist and artists.
Something surprising, but Hahn announced his return some days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in guarded, young hands with good future perspectives.
Both have already been active in the past in the selection of artists and have contributed to flights.
Moreover, in this year, there is a 70-cent special letter mark available at every station of art.
There can also be found for eight euros by Volker Hahn.
Hahn rejoiced for the high advantage of the special exhibition.
For the musical conversion, Max Marcus Stadler was able to be won from Nürnberg.
When walking through the great garden, it is quickly clear that the title "Winter Game Performance" forms the artistic fantasy and makes it easy to express the player.
It's artificial works of metal or keramic, often covered with colored acs.
On the entrance of the presence, the player at the right side of the "lucky tree" expects the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a ba's tube, colored, player with 20 wind trees, 24 hostels and 24 alu-Rs as a sound piece.
With the sun that shines through the bush work in the background, the object acts marvelously and leads to the condensation.
From the angle, Barbara Waschneck, which prefers in three dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in the wind in movement.
On half street, Siegrid Frey from Eckental issued his work "The Wind the heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, people Hahn shows his beautiful fantasy images of sound, cement and edel steel.
The "Winter Game Performance" is introduced to blanking through the multilateral art exhibition.
The special exhibition may be reviewed by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albatten: Singers feast 50. Birthday Festival
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the movement of students.
And the Albanians also made their inmute air at that time.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to find out partly that after the resolution of the Church of Cacilia, there should no longer be any songs in the city.
In the meantime, it has become a legend: at a bank in the thin bus they lift the MGV 68 albums out of the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the Jubileum was large in the "Home of Meeting".
"It will be full today," Mr Jürgen Holstiege said, and he should keep right.
150 guests were a real success for the Albachen singers.
In the Jubilee, they had allowed them to resume the foundation festival.
For years there was a tradition, then there was a break.
In the 50-year-old existence, the traditional festival was there again.
A elegant ball was to be asked for solid clothes before.
The guests sat not like otherwise in the "Home of the Meeting" in rounds, but pleasantly at tables.
Intermediately, movement was reported: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln joined the ruler and asked the dance area.

About their marriage to Hans from Borsody: Gentile Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the dream ship, Heide Keller became to the Star.

Her role of the Chefhostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Traum ship" made the Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018 she went forever from board.
The series that she left to be a star could be compulsory for her failing marriage to Hans of Borsody (1929 - 2013) with which she was married for years.
"It might have been a reason too.
Because I was wake up with this work, I traveled with a coffee alone around the world, and many wonderful colleagues of me took me on the eye height," Keller said in conversation with the "image on Sunday".
In fact, she was always "the woman of Hans of Borsody", but that changed with the "snake" shift.
Because now the journalists were just calling to the Gentlemen Keller.
"I don't know, and he liked it so well."
She thinks it is possible that her at that time husband could have been deceived, but "as many men also looked like Hans talks about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried to be the only right for Hans of Borsody and he wanted to not know my weaknesses.
This means good German: I've been imagined, as she further explains.
She always felt that, "not enough to be good enough for him.
He saw in me a emaneated woman that I never was in truth, even though I sometimes appeared fresh and courageous on the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Hertner, Keller said again yes, "before I had before that it could be a second time."
On the day before the steadfast triumph, I was awakening in the garden and wanted to disgrace everything.
Even the wedding of Borsody.
Why didn't you ever get it with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller presented love at that time as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not always ambiguous.
I've been too naive to love."

Question: 46 Pro _BAR_ marks do not want until 2021 as cancer
After the last weeks, the GroKo kasses several depths of investigation.
The SPD falls in a question behind the afD - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has held the SPD in the Emnid Sunday stream for the picture on Sunday for the first time.
In the weekly survey of the Research Institute, the AfD is a 17% counter, the SPD gives a point in comparison to the previous week and lands at 16%.
The CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only come to 27 Pro.
This is the deepest value for the Union in Sunday stream.
The green is 15 Pro, the left 11 and the FDP 10 Pro.
If you had chosen a party on Sunday, the Governing Parties would have received SPD, CDU and CSU by Emnid only 43% of the votes.
This has now lost the large coalition in all large research institutions, except Allensbach, the majority in the Sunday question.
The Governing Parties are passed by 43 to 45% of the votes (Allensbach: 51%).
In 2017, they received 53.4 Pro together at the date-by-day election.
The width of the band is also large in the other parties: the AfD, in several surveys, is at 15 to 18 Pro.
The green numbers of votes are 12.5 to 17 Pro.
The left is at the average 10 Pro, FDP at 9 Pro.
For statistical reasons, such questions, by voting, have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 Pro to top and below.
But also the residence for Kanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has been clearly disturbed since the 2017 federal day election.
Only 48% of the citizens currently find that the mark is the right in the office, as the Emnid investigation was found in the BamS order.
Only each second (50 Pro%), the survey wishes that the large coalition remains until the next regular conjunction election in three years, 41 Pro for a new choice.
Moreover, in one further investigation published on Saturday, there were evidence of the indicators for labels.
The columns also assesse the Germans whether labels should be candidated again for the CDU Presidency in December.

In the case of the Union's associators, then, 64 Pro would not want a candidate, 35 Pro.
Extension at Aldi: Price reduction for loving happiness
Will Aldi be at Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of tinder there is no romantic teacher discussions anymore - that should be discussed once in Aldi about potter meat.
München - In times of the digital "Fastfood Dating" by thinder and Co., the Super radiates as a skill-learning place for the great love almost a anachronistic romantic.
Yes, right, a talk about reduced potter meat, boxershort shoes on the wheelboard or the favorite puding is still a better story for the later uncle children than just a swipe right.
The App Tinder is in the call to be less than one contact, but more likely a swimming bear.
We waited for the test: How do women react, just in the first message, not long about the heat breed?
This is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood Lovestory potential is then when the loving happiness is forwarded to an out-den-eye-lossed and repeated plan.
If the guy is still reported under the e-mail address bio-puten meat@gmx.de at his beds, then it sounds very much to Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, the author of this announcement is to wish to find her dreamman, with which she has soon discussed the "30 percent reduction of bio-broad meat" also in an unrecognized Aldi branch.
For faith in the magic of the analogue learner, she deserved her Happy End at la Hollywood in any case.

Wolbeck had clearly more games in the first section.
And the chance.
But Frerich's forehead (17.), the changed Luca Rehberg (26.) and Jan Schroer (38.) lost the leadership.
Almost it would have been when the SCA in 41 minute twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naber trees in a year before the Wolbecker Box - Tormann Damian Hallas was a master of his fashion.
After the pause, the VfL often took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters was quickly cut off.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes input.
With the exchange of Miles Geske, a fresh cell currency of the left side was lost again.
As the old Chris Naber trees fell in the 70th minute of Robin Westhues, there was 18 meters before the guest house indirect freedom for the hosts.
The compulsor approached himself and demonstrated his hazardousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right sleep shot down to the left from the sight of the sight of the sight - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes ago, they should be long.
And then this: VfL-Captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th. Minute the lender in the stream unfortunately.
District Hesseyin Sahin (Hamm) indicated immediately on the point.
Jannis Schneider did not allow the gift to escape (79.)
Bange Minutes had to overcome the wolbeck in the steel phase, before the wheat in the 87st minute of twelve meters still had the winner's reef on the puzzle.
Maybe it would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, MEyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rareness in business statements
Only 8 pro­jects of the issues were women on June 1, September, as stated in the report "The Power of Monoculture", which will be presented officially on this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and proposed by the German Presse Agency.
"The enterprises will have to stand differently, elsewhere the international competitors will go over to them," said Funding Business Leader Webke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, men's occupied leaders are pure - with few exceptions - no longer thoughtful.
The residue makes the German competitors less numerous, innovative and future oriented.
It's another business culture.
The low increase in women's share among the German borrowing companies is also due to positive impulses in the median value index (MDax) undertakings.
So, according to Allbright information, only 6.8% of the substances are females.
In the previous year, however, the value was still at 3.8 Pro.
In the 30 Dax undertakings - in the past years - the women's share was stagnated.
Recently, 26 women in the matters.
"I am sure the Dax undertakings will recruit consequent women in the next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that it would not continue to be committed to increase the share of "null Pro".
Another picture is found at the overseers: On 1 September, there was a number of women at 30.5 Pro. - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If many women were recruited each year for the statements, a share of 40 Pro would have reached in 2023," says the report.

Red-white Ahl continues on the place.

The first help was angry overviewable by the entertainment factor.
So whoever wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst could do this uninquiredly.
It wasn't the one to lose a Torchance, because there was practically no one.
First shot after a half hour
For the first (harmless) Torschuss of the whole party, Nick Flock was responsible in the 28th minute.
The best - and in Prince also only real opportunity - the Ahlers, as Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling after 32 minutes, had a shot from the stream border to a parade.
The guests were still worse.
Their most effective action was in an early exchange.
Sturmer Lars Schroder had to be exchanged in the condition of hurt, and Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the continuing long-terms.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel of 18 meters nearly over the house, and after one hour, the goods losers appeared openly.
After a ball-overing of Mattheus Wieckowicz, it was fixed.

RWA-Interimstra · Angelo Daut reacted to Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later one Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It did - nothing.
More than optical surprise thanks to their own initiatives, the Ahlers did not stand.
Only in the 91 minutes, Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it also did nothing.
Angelo Daut tried to express the positive: "I like that we played at zero." But despite the zero also stood forward.
"We were not this time so driving as against woodwicked and though our enemy did not like to play here," RW Ahls Interimstra observed.
Oftensively "plassed everything so little" against a team, "which just wanted to defend.
I didn't feel that we could get an opposite," so much.
To suffer, however, as a viewer, there was no feeling as if his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too possible for this.
Recending fields thanks: Happy, there are enough creimers
The pleasant Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Rockfield Editional Board for which these S.A. are determined.
The honourable people assure: "These Severes are also staying in the rock field."

Because, "This is so beautiful, therefore we're here today," said a cutter.
Organizer of the Festival Franc Joseph Holthaus welcomed the guests in Kiepenkerl's output as always with a regular prize Humor.
For the wedding Brockmann, which should be raised against food, short-term Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer run.
The Verena (dochter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there's enough creamers.
And the "substituting" didn't allow it to interview musically those who were more able to be.
That was so good that some peoples had been sent to a time later.
"Please good," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Citizen Peter Venemeyer was able to submit this time to the date of the appointment.
He rejoices for the many actives with their stages, including major units.
"In fact, there should not be something like a table," he thanked himself for the action of the manchore.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stages and also introduced the other festivals found in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town is a great strike - here's what's going on.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took the maikranz with the firewall and brought it into the winterquarters.
In many places, it was made for the physical welfare.
From sweet to heart, it was to have everything.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who lived in the Reckenfield for a year, became creative at his decoper.
Furnier work, bird cockle with rack field motives, and some more things he had in the boat.
A speciality offered three cycle fields Imker: "Rekenfield honey", combined by Maria-Theresia ́olka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschlocks.
Let’s calls have another speciality.
Honey cooks in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again, so the kitchen was so good.
The ability is that the surveyers then have sealed long-to-night, even without a program that does not exist at the festival.
Smire areas with local policy message: No advertising for shadow facilities
In Langerich, unknown people have made a little favorable way to build a shadow installation.
In several places there are adequate smire, says Jürgen Kohne from the city manager at the request of the WN.
At least one case, the police has been punished for case damage.
In large letters, the three words "Scatepark for Langerich".
Michael Rottmann, the Manager of the Hall, reports that after the professional election on 19 September, a corresponding tract on the advertising child was discovered at the stage to the camping library.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an Edding, they were able to be removed without problems.
"For a few days later, but then it was back there, this time is upset," said Rottmann.
It seems that the corresponding advertising child must be replaced.
A special note is just this case by calling a number of large companies from long-term on the table.
If the estimated installation is built, their performance will also be allowed by sponsors.
It has already been said that Jörg Hesselmann from the town official school, sport and culture is called without name.
But it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those who are on the corrupt table.
The local policy and administration have been employed for years with the subject of Skate facility.
Following the old building at the LWL clinic, after some time, searching for an alternative location began.
The Council has spoken mostly for the firewater park.
This face was implemented in no way - too many people appeared to speak against a building at this place.
The end of June followed a turnover.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee voted on the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the specific planning.
The last word has the town Council.
It comes from a decision in this year, so that it can be built in a 2019 positive vote.
Flight security pass becomes worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the air traffic chaos in summer, the German flights see no signs for improvement in the next year.
"In this year we had wind, 2019, we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said the Chairman of the Flight Safety Agency, Matthias Maas, the German Presse Agency before the air carrier of 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight outcomes has been the personalnote since a long time in flight insurance for which there is no quick solution.
"The Airlines and the airlines can make rapid improvements for the next year, but the training of new lotteries is four to five years," said the workers.
In Europe, the market for completely trained lotteries has been empty.
Only in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German aircray had some 100 people.
Maas again criticized that various air transport facilities were not invited to the bullet.
In the Hansetown, representatives of the Federation, the countries, the flight insurance, the airlines and the airlines will be gathered together to address the causes of late delays.
"If you want to talk about social disturbance and overtimes of work, it will not go without us," said the GdF leader, who has many members in the common German flight security.
Maas made the EU Commission's provisions for Lotsen missionaries responsible again.
The previsions for the period of regulation running up to 2019 were too low.
The cost and staff safeguards resulted from it in the national flight insurance are now fully running to the operational business.
Maas invited the Federal Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to be used in Brussels for regulations that "not yet scatter the air".
Today, the EU proposals would be voted until 2024 and there would be further distortions to be preserved.
The EU is a continuous lobby print from the airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now eat exactly what they have seed in the last years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs have been replaced by flight companies.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Flight Safety (DFS) offers a "voiceful training and future pact", said Maas.
The currently announced recording of 120 lottery students annually over the next five years was just to compensate the oldly-related deficiencies.
The necessary staff building is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Surveillance Board is suitable for the construction of concerts
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted on the plans for the development of the concert.
According to the will of the Interim Chief of Thyssenkrupp Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed to be president on Sunday meeting, the crucial concerts should be divided into two independent companies.
Both enterprises must have their seat in eating and be noted at the border.
There is no additional personal distortion on the already-handed reductions in the administration.
After two retirements, the control body on the capital side is only eight heads.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new boats
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers up to the middle of the next year approximately 80 meetings.
It is because France's State President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that the tolerance price should be taken in Tutzing personally.
For Christian Wulff, the office was too short: As a federal president he was not in Tutzings Evangelischer Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was at the guest.
Thus, the Academic Director Udo Hahn called on him when he proudly said, "All the Presidents of the Federal Party and the Cancellors were already with us." That at the final Tutzing Academy, the Academia, was still prominent, but at the presentation of the annual programme, was also a subject.
On the end of October, Li°Macher Constantin Wecker participates at a meeting about spiritual experience in philosophical perspectives, on 29 September, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's State president Emmanuel Macron also said: He wants to receive the "tolerance price" given by the Academy in Tutzing, which also receives in another category TV modelator Dunja Hayali (we reported).

At a meeting to 200.
Birthday of Karl Marx demn's expected one more spectator of capitalism criticism, the other a tendence "from left to middle".

Music kabarot: Sexual consciousness with heart - Wolfeck - West False News
"Soul for awakened and also suitable for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Tubner on Friday at the Christ's Church Hall in Wolfeck.
As Kabaretestin, the dumbner was stuck with the sexual consciousness, not only with humor and heart heat for the (faithful) woman and (faithful) man and what else it may be, but also with music.
The Mini-Gitar placed her in and also mastered her violine.
On the wheel, Ben Süverkrup sat.
It is to one of the men's sparing partners, who comes down to the end of the satse, to another a true pianoist: so kongerially associated with the swimming group that some wanted to have a solo.
It was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, as it matched the red fat of the evening.
There the tubner had brought a paradoxon into the game: the satisfaction comes to the man, though he has a partner, but this door does not open.
However, a closed door without a partner does not benefit.
The piano sol now demonstrates himself: what would be split out of Mozart's composer, "the Nannerl" would have opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, swimming in improvizations, from Bachs "O head full of blood and wounds" into the "Sing of death", and from Mozart g-moll symphonie in a played dance.
There was a big applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Bloods were delivered by Karlheinz Kleintje, the treasury of the union, the Chansonette.
However, the president of the Headquarters Markenbeck did not give a more common thanks.
She had the idea that Duo would be in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, too in Wolfeck.

From pure fruit building to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stamberger Hall, the 125-year existence of the circuit band for Garden Building and Landsmanagement was organized.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit view in Kulbacher, the latest creation simulations for the circuit band for the building of garden and country management of Kulbach were set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a large jubileum in the Kulbacher City Hall on Saturday.
He was freely called otherwise at that time: as "Bezirks Obst Builderein Kulbach City and Land" he was raised from the baptism by citizen Wilhelm Flessa 1893.
Moreover, the purpose of the vegetation was different from today's work - it actually went about the fruit building, about flowers and garden building, no one thought at that time.
"To that time, in the period of the Opclay, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said circleman Günter Dippold in the Festival Treaty.
Fruit trees should swallow television roads, in schools such as industrial markets have been established.
The building of plants is still a task of 55 garden builders in the Kulbach Circle, which includes approximately 7000 members.
However, the spectrum is not created in any case.
A natural garden building, biological protection of villages, inflation and nutrition plays a similar role, such as supply of, healthy nutrition and youth work.
As many-sided the tasks of a garden building area, the members of the Hutschdorfer Youth Group showed the maintenance on the stage.
"Young work is particularly needed in the digital age," said the circuit president Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences in the nature of life are.
The Kastanian collection was a ridicule case for our children, I doubt that you can collect many joys with artphone & Co. similar.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Sõner to Jubileum.
"Where they should be, the circle band decides," added Landrat Sõner and highlighted the special importance of garden builders for the villages.
The circuit band is for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
That this is a real statement of many garden builders in the country circle, also the circle leader and expert Friedhelm Haun had no doubt.
He conducted the many surveys with an image treaty through the long history of the circle band and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after war.
Everything came out of the garden before, for the winter it was administered.
However, the end of the fifty years has changed the profit garden into a garden of age and residence.
"The nature has stock, it was already before us, and we have to orient on it," the expert for fruit and nuss trees planned.
Therefore, for the builders of the garden, it is to be encouraged not to leave our home to remain beautiful and vital.
It is also to welcome the new citizens in our United States that the president of the Bayer National Federation, Wolfram Vaitl, supplemented.
"We must stop the eclatant decline to insects, that we are guilty of our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif said the acquired Festact, which was celebrated by the tourists of the Thurnau Music Very.

Protest against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro has abandoned the hospital.

Bolsonaro is to make it glorify against homosexual and Schwarze and the military dictature (1964-1985).
He's always shocked again with verbal distortions.
Another time he said that the attachers of Lulas the left worker party should be shot.

120 decibels in thisen explosive forces, such as the annual metal-stellitein in the north of the Republic, usually, the Ahler public does not take place at this rock night.
After nearly four hours, the three bands of the stronger, rocky Gangart longer convinced with their sovereign, unusual game and their own compositions.
"We are here, we have taken the bones and burned a concert with the power of a tiger," all three groups, freely in the oversight, can finally say.

Therefore, he has made the Erdogan "deeply that if the relations are to be normalized in the future, when economic relations are to be deepened, the legal state is a very important condition for it."
Laschet also told the cases of Germans sitting in prison in Turkey, according to its own information.
He has formulated the expectation that the freedom of opinion should be respected.
Thereafter, Erdogan reaffirmed the independence of Turkish justice.
The discussion of Laschet and Erdogan was short-termly placed in a building of the Flight Preparation of the Federal Defence Minister at the Kölner Airport.

That Northern Korea's criminal measures could be "forced by the knees" is "a desired dream of people who don't know us".

Place in Hertha: Reality contained: Bayern against Ajax requested
The predict is insufficient: The download in Berlin will not fall to the FC Bayern.
The next two classicians against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interfaz for the office of Niko Kovac.

"I don't think that this is all a bit, we have to make it again because we don't make the number of chances and make the errors behind," stressed the 23-year-year-old shortly before the outcome from the Olympia Stadium.
On the seventh game day of the previous game time, the Bayers even had five counters behind Dortmund, which now with a point forwarded the top again.

"Yes, that's all right," said the national player.
It's good for the Liga.

And there were many corners and bottles in our strafroom," said the sports representation of Scalke 04 - and breathed.
The king's blue was still able to bring nearly 1:0 against the rainhouses over the time and so that the first seasonship was under the dach and the cave.
It could really be different.
After the driving by Alessandro Creation 11 of the manship of Cheftriner Domenico Tedesco had given security: "In sum, the first half time was good, both playing and pressing there.", played a role with the playing players, obviously more of the head.
Creator: No headball memory

El-Mafaalani grows very locker in reading, describes the writing process of the book, speaks of how difficult it was to understand the subject.
With numerous, hand-fast numbers and one or another, he brings listeners closer to one of the most conflicting theories: migration and integration.
Why, despite acquired integration, exist conflicts?
The Syrian author uses the answer to the question of a metapher.
On a table, the German society sits, in Catechic, the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be on the table.
The generation of migrants has been born in Germany, they have always been sitting on the large table and now want to vote.
This leads to conflicts.
That is not why it is political to the right or to the left, but "I'm for or against an open society?" he states.
First behavior, then more ruler is running in the debate.
And there's a call need.
An Afghanistan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers, how they see alonged or not integrated integration in students.
El-Mafaalani presents, not on the stage, a meaning for the discussion: she is on the top of the eyes.
The sociology professor does not force his opinion, stresses that he speaks of the average, not of individual shock sales.
He is pleased to have interest in the subject because "for the first time, when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the next hour of signature, he opened another ear for the questions of the guests and also became in the Foyer, in prepared Kurdish specialities, intensively discussed.

So Scalkes Naldo "great sport" also on the bank
For times not at the beginning: however, Naldo thanks for Schalke-Trainer Dominico Tedesco.
Gelsen Church - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the last time not in the shalker starting eleven but on the exchange bank, the understanding of many people would have been big if the nearly two meters big Brazilians had spoken the fruit of the soul.
But when the Scalker player was gathered in the middle circle after the 1:0-see of the FSV 05, and thanked the Chefriner Domenico Tedesco at all his professionals, the 36-year-old who called all the simpleness half of Naldo, invoked and said, "We have to thank, Tra!"

A reason called "tax control".
It wasn't easy to tell him.

He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can screw at this time.
And that we all keep in the ship," Tedesco explained the rotation, which recently has also indicated Naldo.
And he reacted to the Brazilians with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also showing himself in the bank as an example of teamplayer.
