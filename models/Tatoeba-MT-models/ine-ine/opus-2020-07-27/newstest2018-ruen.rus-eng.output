The President of Russia Vladimir Putin signed the law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for the deterioration and payment of goods (—, services) in order to purchase public and municipal needs.
This law requires to resolve the issue of unfaithfulness of their commitments by the applicants in public and municipal purchases.
Two years ago, the situation that undertakers were not able to pay for the already implemented State and Municipal contracts was total.
At the same time, the President of Russia has ordered the General Prosecutor RF to take the problem of control.
Since businessmen themselves could not handle non-conscious commanders who had concluded that contracts were not supported, they were at all trying to remove the payment obligations taken and include illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systematically in the country.
Since 2015, in respect of the protection of the rights of the employees to receive public orders, a total of 9,7 thousand presentations have been reported to 4.5 thousand of employees, to the administrative 533, 75 subsequent organs for the organisation of processing checks, and 46 of them have been excited in voting cases.
Consequently, the debt was decreased to the enterprises for more than 66 billion rubles.
These great amounts have been decreased far from the non-payment of billions of contracts.
A number of, systematic delays for paying services to the undertakers were made to the basswords.
This is a character case.
The occupant of the Small Company won a concurrence for transport services for several millions of rubles.
The man introduced all its resources, completely fulfilled the obligations, but the money imposed not received for a period.
Results are an increased financial comm of payments, taxes, credits that would lead to bankruptcy if the undertaking had not been in charge of the procurement.
The problem has now been maximised in a number of regions.
However, for the first half of 2017, the total amount of State and Municipal contracts found by the prosecutors of Russian Federation members, with approximately 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debts continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor works in the manual anticrisis management.
The prosecutor-General is personally conducting meetings with representatives of the authority, which are mainly understood by all covered offences and measures for immediate elimination.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Jaroslavla and Ecaterinburg.
In the quality of improvement of the discipline of public debtors, the Federal Law No. 189-FZ " On amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Rights in the establishment of the administrative responsibility of officers for the violation of the time and payment of goods (--, services) in order to ensure public and municipal needs," which the President of Russia signed last week.
The draft law was once developed by the Russia Mineconomist at the initiative of Gene-Procurature.
The new Law will complement the Code of the Russian Federation on administrative offences, which provides 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for infringement by the officer of the complainant and payment of goods, and services for public and municipal purchases.
And if the official has already been punished by the administrative penalty for the similar offence, he is disclosed for a period of one year to two years.
All the prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already received the mandate to ensure the application of these Novell laws.
The Civil Rights Protection Group announced a warning on the Prevention in Missouri
The National Association of the Progress of the Colour People's Contribution onopened a warning for the people who travel in Missouri due to the discrimination of the State and racism land attacks.
The group's statement sounds: “A warning for the National Association of the Progress of the Colour People, actually until 28 August 2017, calls African travellers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be particularly closer and to show greater attention in the country travellers in relation to a number of suspicious events on the racist ground, recently a place in the entire country and those brought here.”
According to the National Association of Contributions to the Progress of the People, the group ' s prediction warning has recently been encouraged by the Missouri law, which makes people more difficult to win the demands of discrimination, as well as that the rightguards of the State authorities often choose their objects of minorities.
"You have people who are subject to violation of human rights.
They are staying on the roads because of the color of the skin, killing them and killing them,” says the newspaper Canzas-City old, Rod Chapel, President of the National Association of the Progress of the Missure's Color People.
"We are often listening to complaints as never before."
This is the first warning of the kind declared by the United States organization.
The group was sent to incidents such as the decrease of black students at the Missouri University and the death of a twenty-eighty-year Tory Sanders, a blackman from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances before this year after he had completed the benzine during the driving of the state, and Missouri's police arrested him without claiming crime.
The recent report of the Prosecutor-General of Missouri is also mentioned in the warning, which is likely to stop on the road for black drivers by 75 per cent above the white.
“The purpose of warning is that people are in the course of the situation and warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri”, said Chapel.
"The people must be prepared to take money for a loan or to communicate to the relatives who travel in the country's territory."
According to the recent programme for the reporting of crimes on the ground of hatred, 100 crimes were registered in Missouri in 2015 on the ground of hatred, which makes the country sixteenth in the country in the number of such violations.
The predictation warning is also a response to the new law of Missouri State, which will be more difficult after the adoption of the case against the court of the Justice in relation to residence or work discrimination.
The former American Union for Civil Freedom Protection (ACLU) announced warnings for travellers in Texas and Arizona after adopting new immigration control laws, which were prescribed by the legal protection authorities to arrest people for the violation of immigration laws, that, according to the LU, was to increase the number of racial checks.
Previsible warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but public organizations have recently reached in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.

Rosturism supports the law on the cancellation of free baggage for non-returned aircrafts
Chapter of Rosturism Oleg Safonov, at the interview of the RBC telephone, stated that "local" would be to the adoption of the Law on the cancellation of free baggage in non-reverse aircrafts.
"We need to create conditions where a person who has no baggage can buy a ticket other than the one who has a bag," he emphasized.
Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fear of citizens, it would not be necessary for the carrying of clothes and phones in the hand.
"It would be right to calm all our citizens and tourists and to say that it would be for clothes, zones, phones, hipeds, or even any computer will not have," said Rosturism chapter.
The former President of Russia Vladimir Putin signed the law for the right of aircraft to exclude the norm of free baggage in the non-return airport.
The fact and the fact that aircraft companies themselves can determine the amount and the weight of the baggage included in the non-reverse tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate the Baikal pollution
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin at the Baikal Protection Meeting reported that in recent years the lake territory had been extremely contaminated.
He ordered to determine the sources of pollution, plans and artists.
Mr. Putin also commanded to carry out a full-valued recycling of polluted territory.
"We must also understand with the objects that continue to work here, the pure support of most of them," quotes the President's RIA News.
He also added that the Russian General Prosecutor should conduct an examination for the detection of environmental activities.
It states that there are problems in the lake, which have been caused by natural weapons and some injuries in the environment by relaxors.
"I want to emphasize this: not all the way to check, but this is also a measure to know, but it is just illegal and environmental activities and to take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, Genprocuratory reported the reduction of fish stocks in the Baikal Lake and proposed to increase the number of objects under the environmental supervision.
On 15 June, Vladimir Putin announced the need for amendment of law in order to ensure the rights of citizens in the natural territory of the protection regime.
He was informed of the issues of the management of the farming activities of the island of Olhon, which is located in the Baikal Natural Territory.
The Government of Buratia suggested that such changes were insufficient because of the general regulatory acts.
Earlier in the Mineconomy, the problem was resolved by changing the Land Code and Environmental Environmental Law.
A new temple will come in the Southern
The members of the community from the representatives of the corners of the Northern Rahtinia, together with the inhabitants of the Beresi region, participate in the building of the Orthodox Temple in the honor of the Sanhedrin of Nikolai the miracle.
His position is the Âg, the temple will be well seen from remote, so it will serve for fishermen as a roadmaster.

Game IBF on transport maintenance.
The temple is called to honor the Holy Magician Nicolai, because it is considered the Orthodox Church as a traveler, including fishermen.
The fishing industry in Seswee also gives the inhabitants their food.
Local residents are waiting for the temple to open their doors, and children even write about it in schools as an accuracy.
Disneyland with a penalty.
Why does the law keep in Singapore?
I'm talking to the businessman Chang, sitting in a busy air on open air.
In commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette for the other, but the corners are accurately placed in a railboat from the office.
After the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest round - a hundred meters - and takes a bit there.
Struff for the mudder in the public is $500, reported by Chang.
You know, I've just had a reflection, you're just going to put the confect on the pool, now they're driving.
Now it's all the video cameras.
And mostly, Singapore's triturers in the center of the city are clean, like in the museum.
Chang says, three months ago, the 18-year-old son of his neighbor has drawn the wall of the old term.
The Court recognized the guy guy in the vandalism and condemned the pork.
What?
Imagine yourself.
He got ten hits of a wooden bowl on the pigs and spent a week in the week.
We don't have physical punishments of rare.
As in Singapore the highest level of life and incredibly severe laws, it was understood in view of the AIF.
No one thinks to cancel the punishment here, explains Victor Lee Hong.
And the Government has long been taking a view of both the Russian and the United States on this behavior.
If a person carries a large party of drugs or trades them, he has a high place.
In 2002, a 22-year-old citizen in Australia was arrested at the airport of Changi: he was carrying 400 years of cocaine.
It was protected by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, legal defenses and even the Pope of Rome.
However, the guy was still weakened.
Following this, drug curriers are carefully moved by the country.
The matter is: Singapore believes that laws are required to comply with all the subjects, not only with modesty and not with modesty.
No matter who you are, a million, a vice-premier, a artist or a resident of a Russian union.
In this case one, if you find a half of cocain, you'll be weared.
When you go through Singapore and meet tables with dogs of warnings, you are simply giving a miracle -- how many prohibitions in this city!
For example, it is sold only in apteca, and it can be purchased by a doctor.
The tourist won't take a wheat, but it's worth getting a "single" in a metro, and it's going to cut a screen in a thousand dollars.
In four days, I met two guys with white tablets on my neck, "I've been mourning."
In addition to the trap, the worms are often packing to the "Link in the courts" for a week to remove parks and beaches.
60,000 rubs. The " criminal" who forgot to smile water at the public toilet, and when trying to deal with the small need in the home lift, a special detector works - the doors are locked and the signal is sent to the middle.
Including extreme exotic laws, it is prohibited to feed golubs on the street, public fulfillment of songs and even a excessive floor of committing (!): it is considered that water retail is attractive to the comers.
In order to escape fires for the bullets, heat fires in a metro, otherwise five thousand singapore boxes.
In general, the idea is: whatever you try, you're supposed to hurt something.
It's not all right -- it's trying to disappoint me to Mohammed Caber Cajaaria, the owner of the tourist.
In particular, the statistical laws are only on the bow, and in the last twenty years I haven't seen that somebody would be attracted because of their violation.
Why are they kept?
That the citizens don't be disappointed.
The main rules are inconsistently followed.
Let's say, if they are sold to a few years in a kiosk cigarettes, they will be punished by the cup: the master will pay a great amount, the wallet itself will be thrown into the "backer" and the seller will also wipe out and sit in the hall.
Exactly thanks to such serious laws of law in Singapore, it is very rare.
Is that fair?
In the seventy years ago, we had a chaos on the roads -- cars ignored the lightfords, washed as the hotels, were seated drinking behind the roll.
After the ships were introduced in the year, everything was quiet.
Now the driver, drinking a whisky portion, knows that if they stay, the police will not leave for the bill, they will put the valuation of the apartment and they will be sent to the rest for years.
Many foreigners have a city of state in South-East Asia with the diversity of the concilier.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with a chastisement" - a United States guest brought to fear the general riches of the inhabitants, "which fears a clean airport" and "ocultural nature".
Descate, such things are unnatural, look experimentally, and it should not be in principle.
The first days in Singapore, and you're faithfully trying to put the paper on the trotua, you're capturing if you've entered a meter with the frozen.
But then you come to the "Small India" area, and suddenly it's the "break of a template": the bus rest is a plastic box.
"How's that?" You're doing.
That's what the singapores smile.
Everything's going on.
Not for any such crime, but you must know that if you are calculated, you will not be disobeyed because you have violated the law.
Most of this, it's enough to be normal.
Of course, the authority in Singapore is full of authority.
But you know what?
In the Vietnamese Hoshimine, I moved a lot - the motoists often get out of the tourists' hands of smartphones and cameras.
In the center of Paris, there's plenty of crazy bombs and demands.
We are not all trying to throw the mushroom into the urna, too.
Singapore, however, is the most peaceful, clean and safe city of the Earth by means of the set of dracons and ungrateful laws (return to the punishment).
You're changing.
Such nature: Remember, and there was no one in Russia who walked on the role until they were shopping.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not a trap, it is a voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we have to think that people in Russia would also be happy to be clean, to lack of a metro wheel and to welcome the arrest of those who spend the lift with a public toilet.
This is the body punishment, thank you, don't.
In the other laws of Singapore, at least it is worth to take care of them.
Nothing holy?
Now the white House of Trompe has been bound to the Freedom Statute.
The most confidential sign of the change of regime is when it begins to handle statues.
The Americans understand that is not worse than all the rest -- from here the theatre amount of Saddam Hussein's statue in the area of Firos in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Government of Trompe, certainly knew that he did when he took a symbolic battle over the Freedom Statute during an injured periodist with the CNN Jim Acostas on the proposals of the president's proposals for the decrease of the migration.
Let's be honest, Miler hasn't tried the same status.
The owners of shipowners and artists from the Freedom Statute would have stuck him if he tried to do so.
But he tried to make her sense, and especially the meaning that she had been assigned in 1903, 17 years after the finishing of the monument, when Emma Lasarus's verses were added to the peedestal.
As Miller warned on Acest, "I don't want to enter the story in the deep, but the Statute of Freedom is... the symbol of the American freedom that survives the world.
The silence you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Freedom Statute."
Miller made the facts right, but as he said, it's not really about the story.
This is about the current sound of the disappointed words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrants but the poorest, "Your mouths, your poor people, / your tooths, who are trying to breathe freely, / Unfortunate remissions of your exceptional lusts."
"Unfortunate releases" have never been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't work literature -- he was able to understand that the Trump of these people are not waiting in America.
This is a part of the larger political and cultural war: it is actually the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who had been able to put her words on the statue chocolate after her death - were very well-doing that they were committing a complete political act.
The sculpture for the purpose was to identify the relationship between the French and the American resistance using the banal class of the woman's image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her sense: in her verse, women's figure is no more abstract, she has a voice.
And she had completely received another name: the Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of literature and images was a flaming feminist walk and a disastrous attack against the American Nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the rights have changed it back.
Gromoglas Rash Limbo, his kind of John Baptist, who reported the arrival of Trompe in 2010, said that the freedom was not invited, and she was a early nonconservator, which was brought to the dark flame of America in the darkness of the world: "Free and forward.
It brings the freedom chapel from the United States to the rest of the world.
The fake is not needed to light the way in the United States."
Limbo's usual was really a point.
The meaning of the status depends exclusively on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as it would have been seen by potential, unfortunate, but full hopes of people on the boats of ships after a long and often heavy floating.
This means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refugees and chances for a better life.
Its status answers them the words of hope and hospitality they are trying to hear.
And, of course, it's not the pearl that Miller and Trump will ever admit.
They need not to light the way, but to burn hatred, which is the only source of their power.
World Championat 2017: Neal Blake highly evaluates the Scotland members of the United Kingdom assembly.
Elide Doyle remembers the time in which there were only two Scotch people in the United Kingdom.
Neal Blake, Director of the Great Britain's Easy Athletic Game, stated that a 16-scotch part of the world Championat will contribute to the game of a team.
The score of Scotland light airports was listed on the starting London campaign on Friday 2017.
Blake believes that in Scotland "a special thing" is born and that the Great Britain's Easy Athletic Federation should take account of it.
"We know that and we try to understand and support until they have a potential," said Blake.
"I spoke to people at the Institute of Scotland, and they think that it was what they did.
The Swedish Federation of Easy Atlantic thinks that they have to work with what they have done.
The British Federation of Easy Athletic: they have to work with what they have done.
And people in the street think the same way.
I don't know why the circumstances were so, but it's quite brilliant."
From Scotland light athletes, including Laura Mure and Andrew Bachert, who will resist Sir Mo Farach at a distance of 5000 metres, and Elid Doyle has chosen his captain.
"Elid's humiliating.
Her captain's word was great," says Blake.
"Several easy athletes, whether or not Scotlandians are or where they are trained, have come out of this campaign, feeling bitterness and consciousness.
The suffering and the sincere feelings that Elide put in it were wonderful."
The soldier of the Society's campaign, which at its fifth Championat of the world will run a distance of 400 meters with obstacles, says that 16 Shotches in the British Collection are "incredible".
The previous record on the number of Skotlanders in the world campaign was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Forward and forward, Laura Mure, specialized to the middle distance and spent five British and two British records last year.
She'll run to 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who will participate in 1500 m, is another Scotchman to note: a successful season in which he has been won in the British and Yearly Collections.
Doyle recalls his first world campaign when Li Connell was the only Skotlander in the team other than it.
The Captain of the Team says that it is "increasingly proud" that so many of her partners have not just entered the collection, but in some cases, they will be sent to medals and to go out of the final.
"The Captain of the Collection is chosen by other members of the team, so it was an enormous honour, but to know that your companions have voted for you and you -- this is a perfect thing for me," she added.
"End, I'm very proud of all the Scottish people who entered the collection.
This shows how much we got.
And they are all the light athletes that will strive to fall into the pigedestle of the beginning.
What's going on with my capital story?
Yeah, I think she was bad.
I just focused on the fact that we were very happy to take the Championats home.
So it's just about how important it is to be supported by patients and to use that we're going to be on the Olympian stadium again.
I have received another chance to get out of his aren and to participate in the conferences, and the atmosphere there will be just a wonderful."
Crystal locking on Facebook: Do not move to public position if you are not ready to listen to the criticism from the electors
Our country's hairs realized that it was a critical pressure.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't hinder them to criticize him from the internal policy to his political principles.
The criticism of him, of course, was disappointed.
But he didn't touch the mouth of his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "It may be possible for us to take the freedom of the things, and we, the stupid and the weak ones, will be brought as a sheep to the battle."
Now I'm going to go to the Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
The subjects of Hogan have locked and cut posts at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on Facebook's official page.
And this week, the American Union for the protection of civil freedoms gave him a court for this.
Submissive Governors called this request as a noble, and the comments on the Internet were written in the spirit "da and what".
"This is just Facebook," many will say.
But that's also important.
And it's especially important when it's about the Hogan guy.
He is a surprising Pope of the Republic of the Democratic Governor of the State.
It is on the second place in the approved review among 50 Governors of the country.
Hogan isn't a disgusting reaction.
He demonstrates a strong hand in the governance of the State and the commitment of its principles.
It also uses Facebook as a primary way to connect to its electors and demonstrates its rubber on its side after chemotherapy.
It is therefore unnecessary to block people who come to the Governor's page, which has been declared as an official public forum and is conducted by the administration of tax payers' money.
In the Vashington post interview, the press secretary Amelia Chas protected the Governor's action, claiming that the blocking of comments is just their modernization.
But it's too easily to use the image of trolls, spamers and heaters that are wrong in the Internet.
"Post" talked to some of the real people who have blocked Hogan.
And this is real people, not trolls, is a teacher, a businessman, a shepherd who turns to their chosen leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, contained and not covered.
The Pastor quotes calling for Hogan is a Catholic.
Laxmi Sarma Raman from Bouy, Maryland, was not hating, but asked for crimes on the ground of hatred.
"I have written a pleasant comment on the fact that I am disappointed by the lack of his reaction to crimes committed on the ground of hatred and other news of the last time," she wrote in the section of comments to the article "Post".
"And I don't like the idea that when many people remain in comments on the same subject, some say that this is a so-called pressure, rather than to recognize that they have a large group of unfair citizens."
What the Governor's submissive name is "con-spam attack", others probably would be called "active lifeplace".
In Facebook's era, it is easy to subordinate its image, simply blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
This is much less than before when it was required to send people, collect and burn newspapers with critical prejudices or arrest and push the mouth of protestants.
But that's exactly what's going on now, just in number.
Hogen is not the first factor that criticizes that he doesn't want to listen to Facebook and other societes.
The Chairman of Trumpe has been requested by Twitter users who were banned in his Twitter account.
One of the first reverse decisions on this subject was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the United States Environmental Court of Justice of Alexandria, James K. Casheris, the president of the Counsel of the Charter of Laudon violated the First Amendment by dismissing the elector at his account in Facecbook.
And in Kentucky, the Resp of the Governor of Matthew Bavin presented a claim of the American Union to protect civil freedoms for his behavior in Facebook and Twitter.
It must not be so difficult.
At Washington’s time, available mail expenditure has made sometimes the same turnover as the Internet today.
Since 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers has grown four times, and the authors of anonymous letters have decreased its authority.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
People under Juricola, Valerius, Belarius and Percius wrote letters in Washington's newspapers.
According to the historical documents set up by the "Documents of George Washington online", his office was rejected by five who criticize its position on the Treaty on Friendship, Trade and Sea.
But he didn't try to make them quiet.
Freedom of speech, disappointment and statements is in the same position of our State.
And true leadership means agreement.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for residential benefits in the Renessans club
The former campaign of Ronan Rafferty hopes to live for the next three days when the Renessans club in East Lotian will accept the twenty-fifth open Schottland golf tournament for elderly sportsmen.
The born of North Ireland, who is a member of the neighborhood in the Archerfield Links club, moved to the final round last year until he lost Paul Ilsa, joined the new and played the role of the representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi Club.
"I saw the Renness Club building, and we watched how he has succeeded with this business," said Rafferti.
"The players will see this field at his best time, it is in a great state.
Jerry made a wonderful place by arranging this place.
He's the yellow boyfriend of this game, and he's stuck with his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field."
Anglican Ils expects the first time to stand a campaign title, despite the victory of his 32-year-old career, and in the tournament of the European Challenge Tour.
"This is really a feeling," said the player from Sautport.
“I couldn't try to win Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the description for a year after I won it.
To return to this angle of the world, it's great.
This is a place for the golf game.
The memories of the past year are returned, and for me and my wife Sheron was completely impressive to win the last year.
It was really a special time, and we will always remember it."
It is returned to the battle in the land of Gary Orr, along with the tournament for elderly sports, after 50 years ago.
This will be his first event in Scotland since the “Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open” tourist in 2013.
"When you play home, it's always a little more important," said the inhabitants of Helensboro Orr.
"You want to speak good, but you feel this additional burden."
I played again with great pleasure, and I showed a bad golf.
I am satisfied with the time it gets."
In the field of this trio, the former Victor of the Masters tourist Ian Wosnem and Major campaigns for elderly sportsmen Paul Brotherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark's.
Orr and the former captain Rider Cup with Property Torrans are two of the six Shooters on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Steven ́alister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drammond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and the parking is 5 pounds per hour, if one person is in the car, and 10 pounds if a person is two and more.
All income comes to the British Cancer Fund of Prostate.
British roads are learned to increase emissions
Manufactured tunnels on the magazine that are able to raise the busy car on the road are already tested on the roads of the United Kingdom.
The transport agency, as reported from Autocar, has reported the local results of the 100-meter tonnel tests set on one of the six north of the country.
A tunnel of 6 meters high is built from some newer polymerate materials that can absorb ≥ ≥ 1 m in car exhausts.
However, the creation of the whole network of such tunnels is only a part of the scale measures that the United Kingdom authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to tunnel networks, English people are going to enhance the network of ships for electricity, make a number of activities for reducing the car stream on the road, enhance the use of commercial transport on electrical burden and modernise the park of heavy wagons.
According to the official statistics, the fourth of all pollutions of the atmosphere are directly transported, and the unsatisfiable air quality becomes a cause of up to 40,000 preliminaries per year.
Moshord has changed the chastisement of Mamaeva's invalidity
Mosgarsod has changed the penalty of Antona Mamamaeva, condemned by four and half year, to 200 thousand rubs.
That is what the TSS reports.
Earlier, the prosecutor asked the court to replace a term for a conditional person, explaining its request by saying that Mamma's disease " prevents him from finding him under conditions".
The 28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years of freedom from discharge in the general destruction regime of the victim of the former specialist.
On 19 July, the Court of Justice at the SISO meeting released a man from under-ge.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Golden Land
Prepared dinner, Bardina Degey doesn't use the floor.
She even uses bitterly rarely.
In his wooden house in Enarotala, the capital of the Panyai district in Papua Indonesia province, the householder usually simply places a sweet cartridge, which is called “nota” here, directly in the wheat.
Semi - hourly covered clubs are also eating with inconsistent, impatient hands.
Degei is sitting on the ground - there is no furniture - and it is here to carry out her home, such as a steel of clothes of mute water from a diluted nearby bottle.
The wheeler serves in a stone without a wheel.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, and so she's not ordered to work in the field.
Multi-family is distributed here.
Of course, working lately may be dangerous: many men from this village without drinking, many drinking, and there are still soldiers.
"No one decides to walk through the village after five dinner," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at all the day in the high mountain of Papua, the former Netherlands, which was accompanied to Indonesia in 1969 after the questionary referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote with the hands of the occupying armies.
The existing movement of independence from the Netherlands has quickly exposed his anger against the Government of Jacarta, which maintains a severe control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and defenses.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea takes the east part of the island.
Anarotali is the city as remote as well as discharged; the road here includes a half-time flight from Jayapura, the province administrative centre, in Nabire, and then a five-hour plight on the rental car.
There is no common transport here.
The city with a population of approximately 19,000 people consists of housing houses of bambus coverages, and the hairs of frozens have been improved in various red-road ovens.
Some of the Indonesians have reached here, not talking about journalists, and almost any of the foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Papuases worshipped a god named Uga Tamée.
There were other changes.
“We were unusual to wear this clothes”, Degei reports, with its bright, hand-skined bain, dark bubble, and light rubber.
"We had only weared on the body a letter before."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population lives for poverty, and levels of poverty and gratitude among the worst in Asia.
But it's also an Indonesian golden land.
The largest in the world and the most accommodated gold tube, Grasberg, which belongs to the Freeport McMoran company in Phenix, is located in sixty-sixths of Panay, a high-height province of about 153.000 people.
Only in 2015, Frieport's company got around 3,1 billion dollars.
The Papoa additive may be valuable by the stocks of the forest, which are estimated at $78 billion.
These riches, however, cause a disaster to papouses, guaranteeing that the powerful invasion forces of Indonesia keep their exciting presence here.
According to the 2005 study of the new York Times, the Freeport was payable to military servants and officers between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000.
Increasing autonomy requirements from the popuas threats to this golden wheat and are unfortunately pressured.
Since 1969, more than 500 000 papouses have been killed by military forces of Indonesia, and thousands have been violated, tortured and lacked freedom.
As the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass murder in the population of Papous high mountains in the seventy years can be considered genocide.
Only last year, the police of Indonesia arrested more than 3900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We lose everything”, the report of the Brisban Eparchy in 2016, contains witnesses of the forces made in the previous year, such as punishments without court, torture, particularly parts, as stated in another report, violence and electricity disorder, and cruel pressure of peace demonstrations.
“The number of victims is hard to count because the events are happening every week”, says Andreas Harson, who is undertaken in Indonesia for "Human Rights Watch".
The Gaiki's delays, since Papua's resources have attracted a cross-resident from other regions of Indonesia.
The 3.5 million people of the province are 83 per cent of Christians, but the demographic indicators change as far as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the Gustonasian Indonesia Islands – Java, Sumatra and Sulvavia.
The Japanese lavoves, "varungi", sold the frozen tube and the mixture of the fruitage of the "gado-gado" with the arachis suce.
Local residents are trying to endure competition.
“The migrants started to sell tube and fruits on the traditional market than Papoa's roots”, explains Abet You, the twenty-four-year Panai's birthday, which moved to Jaipur, the administrative center of the province, for work.
"The roots of Papoa are Papoa's mother's mother (women's women) who have lost their markets of loss."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, who was in the people like Jokovi, swore to take place in the inequality and violations of rights in Papua in his presidential campaign in 2014.
On its road to the presidential court in Jacarta, the former officer was assigned to support 27 of the 29 areas of Papua, including Panay.
But there was almost nothing in Papua, and the people feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because we vote for Jackie in 2014, expecting him to fulfil our hope of restoration of justice,” says Joe.
In fact, only two months after the October inauguration of Jocky Panai had experienced a tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children was on the street and sang birthdays in the Enarotala coast, when two Indonesian soldiers were cast out of darkness.
Fearing children told them that they had to include the farms.
As the pastor Javedt Tebai reported, one of the soldiers hurt their tonnes and returned with four soldiers after a while.
According to the sacrifices and evidence, the soldiers who were drunk followed their children and were their examples of vine.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One kid, Julian Aimo 16, was so deceived that he fell into anybody.
A couple of hours later, somebody undergone a disappointed nearby government from the election committee, and the situation was deteriorated on the day.
Approximately a thousand Papuas men, women and children were gathered in the football field before the police party and the military commanding center to need justice.
They brought with themselves a ritual about the woods and fulfilled the white, the dance of the Popua tribe of my pago: they fled around and from the bird songs.
Protestants began to swallow stones to the police and military base.
When the situation was disappointed, the internal radio-related soldiers were ordered, "If the crowd would resist more than three times, shoot them," he learned, as stated in the official document that the TIME reporters had seen, but which was not repeated in the MVMs.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremias Kaime, head of the Kago Coto region in Enarotala, felt a danger and invited the rest to the crowd with a request to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I returned, I suddenly got a puddle in the left side," he told the magazine "TIME", standing on his wings of a nicely nice tree house.
Kayama doesn't know who shot, but he says that the pupil is coming from the shering.
He added: "There was a crowd, the shooting was a lot."
In the inhabitant of Alfius Job three times, as his two - year - old brother, who became a witness to the shooter.
“I approached him and looked at his body to make sure he was”, Johnes, who, as many Indonesians, was just one name.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
General Jodge Mande, the senior of Papua police officer, said to the reporters that his officers were only "defending" their base because she was attacked.
"We must be protected when people are threatened to kill us," said the police representative of Papoa Commissioner Pujo Sulistio in 2015.
"This is the issue of life and death."
According to the "Human Rights Watch", five young protesters were killed and were much more vulnerable.
The news of murder came to Jacarta only for a day.
Three weeks in Jayapura, Jokovi spoke of a poultry thing in which he expressed the disease of the victims families and swore to take the question of historical misuses in Papua.
"I want this situation to be approved immediately so that it will never again again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Security Minister Viranto said that he would create an injurious body to end historical violations of human rights.
But nearly in front of the answers.
"The most of the violations has occurred a long time.
There were nineteen or a zero.
The matter is that we certainly want to commit these violations, but they do the procedures that must be carried out,” he said.
Then Viranto rejected his words, speaking with the journal “TIME” in Jacarta on 5 June, and said that it was not planning to establish a body for the review of the complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All shall be judged by judgment."
Virant, whose accusation by the United Nations of " crimes against the unity" was due to more than 1000 people during the blood vote for the independence of East Timor in 1999, stated that 11 cases of human rights violation in Papua had already been agreed, including the incident in Panay.
The families of victims from Panay met such statements with dark disbelief.
“In the last three years, I was asked four times, but there was no changes,” says Johanes.
"I'm standing."
He says years later, he still lives in fear.
He says, “I am.”
"I fear that I am arrested by the warriors, I fear that they will shoot me."
His brother James also stated that the people of Panay were afraid to discuss the event.
He said that he was killed by warriors after he helped to bury four victims.
He says, “When we buried the body, the warriors came after me.”
The shot hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot in the village in the neighborhood of Panay, the surrounding of Dejai.
In the meeting between the village residents and the building company manager who refused to help a man who was unconscious to the hospital died and 17 more were hurt, including children.
A man, a twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, who was shooted in the fish in the nearby run, died on the way to the hospital.
Injured villages protested before the building area of the company.
According to the police, the villages were shooting stones in officers, which were responsible for warning shots.
But the people claim that the mobile brigade (Indonezian specialist) started to shoot the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of remuneration”, reported the 24-year-old Timothy Buddy Doming, who lives near the hospital and has seen how successfully the wounds have been done.
"I've been at home two days."
The Parliament had requested that the officers who were interrupted would be called to answer and the police brigade would be responsible from that region.
Panius was always a painful place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development results in the deficiency of the tribes of mea, monkeys, data and ladies splitted throughout the area of the Green Centers of Papua.
Many attended the Free Papoa Movement (OPM), a rebellious army, which claims that it protects the rights of Popeas by providing co-operative attacks and attacks on people to the Indonesian soldiers.
Of the highest rues of the OPM are from Panay, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoi.
As a responsible measure in the past years in Panay, thousands of people have been arrested and unbasedly arrested by military forces under the proposal of “the protection of national independence”.
They didn't come back.
In the population of Papua Panai, it is considered a "ground, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens deficiency.
The small part of the rice sold in Enarotala is too precious for people.
The bread is not available at the same level.
People here produce everything that they eat: mainly, notes, and some of the fibres and the sheet fruits.
Agriculture is women's work, each of whom can be seen four-five fields of sweet cartridge.
They usually maintain the majority of the frog for the family, and the rest is sold on the market.
Ten club notes are only 10 000 Indonesian rupes (75 cents).
For a long time, economic inequality has increased between root papaes and new migrants, which have arrived in large quantities after the introduction of new airports to the Nabire airport.
A few holiday vacations are usually obtained to more educational and sustainable migrants.
Papuases are rarely enough for money or skills to carry out their own competition.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village... because there is no job or money here," says John Gobai, president of the tribe Council of Panay.
Isolation holds Papua away from the views of the island world.
Furthermore, MMI remains cruel.
French journalists Frank Escuddy and Basil Lonschan were deported from Papua for “sufficient employment with the relevant” despite their rar permissions to conduct video records.
According to Felly China, the director of the Asian Organization of Human Rights Watch, the promises given in the pre-election campaign of Jocky were not fulfilled with a cancellation of SMEs in order to promote transparency and development.
“Today, foreign journalists who are trying to report report from the East Indonesia provinces, Papua and West Papua, are with new dangers: rejections in vize and black list,” he stated in the statement.
The lack of attention from the pressure means that the international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is mainly direct by the Papua neighbors.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – asked the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the "diversity and broadly spread violations" in Papua, including the shooting in Panay.
The same countries were supported by OPM in the past.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia Harraman Nasir rejected the statement of the group, reporting to the journalists in Jacart that “Indonezia still acts as a democratic system and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to hide the evidence of human rights violations”.
Local residents wish to focus more on the situation by the number of foreign governments.
When the official delegation of the Netherlands headed by the Netherlands Human Rights Affairs Kiss Van Baaram visited Jayapur on 4 May, the residents inquired silence, please, "We want freedom," as a source, which also attended at the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, in 2019, new presidential elections have been held, but the Papuases say that they are almost talking about Jocky again.
"Jacovi is a man who has good works but is surrounded by people who are involved in the shot in Panay," says Gobai, the president of the Council of the tribe.
He wants Jackie to know that the people of Panay, except that they are in the shadow of threats from the army, are in poverty, and education and health are in a grievous state.
Gobai says that the inhabitants of Panay, as well as the other papaases, consider their voice devoted to Jackie for the duty he should pay.
He says, “They do not need money, but they only want justice.”
Despite threats and threats, the family of shooting victims in Panay have implemented the last symbolic failure act: they have saved the body of one of the victims on the ground in front of the police and military party.
As they know that justice is probably never surprised, at least they do not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“They have killed a member of our family”, says Jacob, unless they are raised up.
"What else did we do?"

There was a reason for mass dragging in the Ural military center
A slave group of senior officers of the Central Military Department has arrived in the Elaan School Centre for the investigation of the incidents.
Some details of this fear have already been made.
According to the figure Mash on the VContakte page, the contractors of the Ural military party number 31612 were cruelly deteriorated because of an undirected bed.
Everything began since the row named Sayan is a demonstrative prospector; the officer's order to deal with the shopping purchases.
On the side of the officer, military servants were raised from the sixth mouth.
Diana supported the first mouth.
In half hours, 140 young boys were disgraced in bed and cancer caught, and the glass was cut off.
More than ten people were suffering in the mass dragon.
The CWO reported the shipment information.
The investigation showed that at least one five passenger in the United States was carried out forbidden objects on a plane.
The investigation showed that more than 20 per cent of the aircraft carriers had been carried out in the aircraft to the aircraft by monitoring of the United States Transport Safety Supervisors, including at least 6 per cent, without prejudice to the prohibited ships or other rough objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that later they discovered that they had accidentally firearms, struggles or explosive arts.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., and more than 1000 people, also showed that young passengers were more inclinated to violate rules.
Of the representatives who recognized that they were aware of having tried to fly with something that was prohibited by ATB, 19.7 per cent were less than 15 per cent of the members of the X Generation.
Consciously, the ATBs are most often carrying food and water.
More than 3 per cent were recognized that heavy objects were specially monitored, and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men were recognized that they had awareness of the prohibited medicines in the airplane.

We hope that most often is aware or inconsciently, the contraband is protoking through the monitoring of those who are most flighting.
As the company indicates, ATB rules are sufficiently complicated and pagan.
People often do not know exactly what weight they can carry and how much.

Sometimes ago, people thought that ATB could be considered prohibited to carry out books.
Inner flights are allowed, but not on flights.
The EPA Chapter refuses to reject the implementation of the emission reduction rules adopted in Obama
On the next day, the Chapter of the Environmental Environmental Agency requested 15 states refused to delay the implementation of the rules adopted in Obama for reducing the emissions of air pollution and leading to smoke education.
It explained that its agency is now more than in previous administrations as well as in the needs of the environmental environmental regulators.
He did not mention the dispute against his previous position in the Federal Appeal Court.
The opposite was extended around 1 October, to which States should ensure the conformity of the 2015 ozon standards at the ground level.
In June, June, June stated that they would take their compliance for one year in order to give their knowledge more time to study the plan and to avoid " unconformities with decisions or obstacles to economic growth".
A general prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma was long before the Chairman of Tram was appointed to his current position as a follow-up opposite to the ecological standards.
After moving to Washington, he repeatedly made a block or rejected the introduction of the rules against chemical or gas-naphthane industry.
The unexpected change in the middle of the course is a specific juridian's deterioration of the Piuith course to return to the former standards.
Last month, the Federal Appeal Court in Washington stated that the EPA Chapter had exceeded its powers, trying to delay the implementation of the Omama Administration of the rules required by oil and gas companies to follow and reduce the flow of the metal.
In the midnight statement, Juitt proposed to consider that he simply exercised the responsibility of cooperating with the states in a comprehensive process of timely implementation of new standards.
"In the previous administrations, the EPA was often not able to deal with the planned periods, then waiting for the exhibitions from the groups of activists and of other persons and discussing the periods of resolving the case," said the Juit, which gave more than a decade of exemptions against EPA at its previous post.
"We do not believe in the regulation through judicial proceedings, and we are going to be serious to the time set.
And We shall be severe to our statute and to the authority which He gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that Juitt may at some time re-use its "completion for delay and other powers under the law" to ensure that "jcyjdfys" standards are clear and available.
The replies at the Congress are focused on a broader review of the rules of the Kasa-zone.
The draft legislation approved by the representatives of the Palace last month seeks to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years.
The Senate has not voted on this issue yet.
The prosecutor-General of New York Eric Sneederman, who called the Coalition of States, undertakings on this week against EPA, said that the group was intended to continue pressure.
"The change in the EPA course - after our clusters - is an important victory in combating health and security of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affecting the figs covering their cities," said Sneederman.
To the request of New York, California, Conneequat, Delaver, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mee, Oregon, Penhvania, Rod Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as Columbia's surrounding.
The ozone at the earth appears when normal polluting arts from vehicles, electricity, petroleum and other chemical plants and other sources are reacting to the atmosphere with solar light.
The resulting fig from this fig can cause serious breathing problems in those who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of preliminaries per year.
Health Protectors and Environment Protectors welcomed an unexpected change in the course of Juitt.
"It is cruel to think of how much pressure was needed to achieve this completely logical step from a person that was ordered to protect the air we breath," said Lori Anne Burd from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to oppose the ideological campaign of the Trumpa Administration and protect those who pollute air and their interests."

According to the phone decryptions, Trump pressed me on the side of the wall payment on the border
The Vashington post magazine opened the decryption of phones between the President of the United States of Donald Tram and the leaders of Me ́ki and Australia.
On 27 January, in the phone with President Me Me'ka Enrique Pnyay New Tromp, he urged him to stop publicly to say that it would not be behind the planned wall on the border.
The President of the United States deceived him because he was publicly speaking against the wall, and the information that was extended said to him, "You can't speak this press."
Trump started its pre-election campaign with the promise of building a wall to the southern border of the United States and swearing that it would make Me pay for a project.
In the decrypted discovery of his first phone with the Premier Minister of Australia, Malcolm Ternbulle, was also found a warm shift.
Thrump told Ternbulle that the agreement to which the United States should take refugees was sent to Australia, “mixed”, “reverse” and “tupoe” and claimed that because of the agreement concluded by Obama's administration, it would look like an idiot, since it was intended to stop the transfer of refugees in the United States.
Thrump ended, said Ternbulle, "it was the most uncomfortable for the whole day."

This has resulted in a combustion of a store, which is the result of non-controlled explosions of different modes.

The study of Russian impact on American elections is a major jury
The Russian Prosecutor Robert Muller invited a big Jury in Washington, which would take place in the study of the impact of Russia on the elections of the president of the United States in 2016, reported the newspaper The Wall Street Journal and the Agency Re.
A lot of jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential violations and have the right to question witnesses under the swear.
The collected materials will be studied by the prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to make a claim.
The call of a large jury gives Muller additional powers for the congregation of witnesses.

They're already studied by the FBI.
On the end of July, it was reported that the younger Donald Trump extended the state of his lawyers.
The younger Trompe told earlier that he had waited for a compromitment from the Department of Hillary Clinton, but no disturbing documents had been presented, but that was the result of the creation.
In the beginning of August, a number of MMI reported that the Trum of the youngest on the meeting with Veselnic was literally addressed to the Tram of older.
In the White House, the president was not a dictator, but simply expressed his authority that any father would do.

Of course, there is no cosmodrome in Me'ke, nor rackets of wearers.
But there is an agency and a desire to develop its own space programme in 2010.
And the establishment of the buist of Juria Gagarina is a respect for the first person in the space.
Despite the memories of the Council period, which are in some countries, Gagarina's memories, in contrast, "shake on the planet".
In 2012, the mountain was established in the United States of Houston near the former NASA apartment.
The memory in the Royal Observatory territory in London was established for the first 50 years of the first flight in the space.
There is a memory of Gagarin in Germany in Erfut, where our cosmonavate stayed in 1963.

Morse Ford murder: Activists lose the Linch courts on the scene to call for justice
The Ford Mercurie, 1948, passed over the stars in the village of Monroe in Georgia, and was thrown to the small Mource Ford.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver arrived to the bridge, a group of white men with roses rebuild her.
The main man of the middle-year-old costum in a tonch-screen-shore-shore-shore-shore-sheeted and looked through the wind glass.
The insides were scared.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" said the man.
"Bring him out of the car!"
Proncess' screams destroyed the silence when a young black man was dropped out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, was just an inscenary.
But when Roger's neck was thrown, almost all the stars and actually breathed.
Since 2005, the activists return to Morse Ford Mount to lose the night again when two near-coat couples - Roger and Dorothy Malk and George and May Murray Dorsi were born in 1946.
No one was condemned for these murders.
"It's fair that no one has been arrested for all these years - although we see them nearly; although we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who has helped organize the statement.
"It's a roof of our story, and it's a stone of our souls."
71-year-old Brooks, the former member of Georgia's conference, who is fighting for human rights.
For him it is a dramatic call to the population of Monroe and an annual reminder that injustice has not been corrected.
"We want investigations, we want conclusions, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but dream we must get justice," he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we do justice."
The Coroner covers the simple body of one of the victims of linching at Morse Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI, more than 50 persons in Monroe and neighborhood offices were suspicious to participate in linching.
But there was no accusation to anyone.
Although the decades of suspicion remained free, the right-defenses say that the town always knew two motives of lingeries: policy and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court first allowed the black citizens to vote on the premises that had to be held in that year.
Approximately during the same elections, the FBI reports, the black islander Roger Malcolm struck the dragon of Barnett Hester's knife, the white farmer, seems to be a woman.
Brooks says that, after listening in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she had to be born was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a major white farmer, paid 600 dollars to deliver Malcolm from the wine.
He went to the room with Dorothy and their neighbors May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they were driving from the hall and traveling to Mors Ford, the crowd of the springs surrounded the car.
"The fact that he organized and commanded Harrison murder," such a conclusion is made in one of the reports of the FBI.
"It is evident that there was a negotiation between the laws of the State and the city, which had not only participated in murder, but also made evidence and hided the persons of witnesses."
Brooks calls it a bit.
"This was an attempt to choose rights," he says.
"They have all killed to send a sign of black in the city: if you register and vote, it will be the same with you."
Almost ten years of Cassandra Green Ru will be an annual axle that plays the linching at Morse Ford.
It's observed, he's taking a viewer and reporting the deep racism that many would like to consider is not more in America.
It's hard to look and too difficult to turn away, but Green thinks that it's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about the courts of Linch because they have our own nature," she says.
"But I can't build with you if you don't hear me or you don't hear me."
Repetitions of this year began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a decade of white, the rest of black - gathered together and listened to the exhibition of the pesce during the years.
Wade Marbo was a register with Green.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for a few years, but he said that the role was not even more.
"I don't think I'm packed because it's not the man I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at that time."
Darryus Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
Spectal begins with that Malcolm, disappointed by Hester's sleeping with Dorothy's wife, crying to him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
He's calling Rascon to answer.
It's hit.
At the same time, all (at least all the black actors) are distracted by ho.
Green's laughing the sound of everyone.
"What's that?" Askson asked.
He's calm and sad.
I'm playing over?
"No," says Green through laugh.
"I just don't think the white people said 'nigga'."
"Yes" is one of the black artists.
"You have to take a strong "r".
It also changes energy in the camel: discomfort changes the feeling of society.
Everyone has to do everything right, not only for the cup, but also for the memory of four killed persons.
The scene starts sleeping.
This time, when Rascona speaks the word in the letter "n", it gets clearly and strictly.
No one laughs.
The spectacle ends hard and quickly.
Cryking, shooting, and then silence.
The woman in a black clothing stands over the body of the actors and fills the big song Billy Holiday "Stragne Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
In a hundred of yards, half of the stars are cut off from the eyes of the tears and the pool.
A number of black and white are almost equal to the stars.
One couple came from the New York state to see the presentation; many will be completely near.
They all were almost eight hours suffering by Georgia's hard spirit while Brux led them to the sepulchre of Malcolm and Dorsi.
Before this time, murder was only a story, but now, when they stand on the same spectacle where people linched, they're welcomed in the air.
When the song is quiet, Green invites people to come closer to the body.
Children are drawn to their places, touching the beauty of blood, and unmoving bodies, and heading something one to another.
"They're not actually dead," a little boy worms, like to talk about it himself.
For a few minutes, Green thanks to the stars, and suddenly it's over.
Actors break their necks and cut their tears out.
Bradshaw's covering Marbo, a man in the costum, playing the main cocktail.
Nick Rascona covers two other actors, and suddenly weeping, falling in their volumes: the emotional burden was finally disturbed on him.
"All right," is one of the women's head.
"We know that your heart is good.
You had reasons for it."
Lookers later sit down to dinner with the actors.
On one table, the white couple of Atlantic is deeply discussed with the black couple with which they just met.
Dennis Daplinski hardly looks for words to describe what she feels after the .
"It's hard to listen to these terrible, bitter words, and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"Therefore, I think it's going to happen until this hole," she adds, "only now it's called that the police's shooting."
In the second angle of the camels, Tyron Brooks had general attention, who reminded his rightsman after eating.
He says that it has already started to plan the presentation of the year.
"The spirit's position will bring us, because it does not only describe the fear of what we have survived but also teach us," he says.
"Because if you don't get out of this lesson, that can happen again.
Those who don't study their story, who don't know their story, are about her repeat."

They took from there camels at ESPN channel offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, an unrequired campaign at the World Boxer Council, had not passed through the corridor to welcome Lomaczenko, the World Boxer Organization campaign in the second half.
After a single vote of Garcia over the former world campaign in four weight categories of Erian Browner on the Showtime channel, both boxers are entered into five best boxers outside the weight category.
Garcia about the right hand said, "How do you do, champion?
Happy be to you."
Lomachenko protects his area in a single room with Miguel Marriago on Saturday at seven hours at ESPN channel.
When the boxers were bought for it, manager Lomachenko Egis Climas noted that the potential solution between them would be the most.
"I've been in a semi-easy weight," he told Garcia.
"I got a category for Browner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not so great.
I'm little for 140.
I want to go down to the half-easy.
And he needs to get up to a half [to 135 pounds], and then we'll build a single.
That's what the sick people want.
Let us prepare it for them."
I'm sorry. I agreed.
"Boxus needs this unit."

They both said that they felt how pressure grows in front of their own unit.

No other fight causes such interests and interests.

New test results for the age of refugee candidates in Sweden have been reported
The latest results of refugees tests in Sweden, which have been subject to the new medical method of age, are that more than 80 per cent of the protested were evaluated as 18 years old, but not all believe the exactity of these results.
The Swedish Court Medical National Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began to test the previous year.
They were held to make age more accurate in the delivery of refugees after the Swedish Migrationsverket (Migrationsverket) claims that they were unfair to determine the current age of some refugees.
At this point, Migrationsverket sent 6 880 cases to test, and the Court Medical Agency repeated the results of 2 481 tests for the period between the middle of March and 31 July 2017.
Eighteen per cent of the tested (2002) were evaluated as 18 or older people, and for more than 25 cases, the Court Medical Agency expressed that the tested “probably 18 or older person”.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion claimed that the person “probably not less than 18”.
The tests are carried out only in cases of age.
According to Johan Giranson from the Court Medical Agency, the results correspond to the results in the past months.
“We have not observed the great difference in statistics in the past months, totally relevant numbers”, he said to the Portal The Local.
The high share of the cases in which people were estimated as 18 years of age does not necessarily indicate that the demanders of refuge were lying according to their age.
In my Agency, the results of 581 tests were reported and reported that in 442 cases, “age of 18 or more years tested”.
However, considering 581 of the results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet discovered that in 243 cases, a person openly declared that 18 were implemented in this year.
The method of conducting the age of age in order to make the teeth recycling of wisdom and toography of the combined ingredients and to give them to the Dantists and Rentgenologs, also caused criticism in some institutions.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinolog from the Caroline Institute of Claude Markus, whose work is a biolog of adults to determine whether they have passed by sexual reception before or later.
"I had reasons to think about it, and I don't think that we should take into account the ways of measurement that are currently used.
The biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can't determine it with confidence, we should not do what we can," he said the newspaper Metro.
However, Guarantee of the Court Medical Agency expressed the use of the test accuracy: “In general, it can be said that the risk of taking a child is wrong for an adult.
With the biggest risk we're faced when a person's 18, in this case he's about 10 per cent."

How football financial rules affect the movement of Non-Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited contracts from the Peese Football Clubs will not be limited to the global transfer record of Non-Barcellona from Spain to the French "Paris San Jerman".
Whatever the consequences may have, more on the box, for Pare San Jerman from the WEFA, the rue of the controller of the Peee football, in which the power of prohibiting the staff to participate in the pressing tour of the Liga Champions.
In the financial rules introduced by the WEFA in 2011, the PSH should finally be shown that the transfer of the Non-Ray was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million (262 million dollars) only to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a complaint that will have tens of millions of dollars per year.
There are some financial and financial movements of Non-Ray to France.
The ‘PSI’ can be exhausted in order to acquire and add it to the hall of other stars if it is involved in participating in the team by the rich energy of the Catarr family.
Clubs have the right to lose major amounts for the gain of players, but they have to evaluate them as the legal resources of income to achieve the rental rates in their football bus.
The IFP introduced Michelle Platini after his election by the President of WEFA in 2007.
An earlier French footballist believed that the clubs involved in great effort to succeed, in fact, risked and destruction if the banks or owners had stopped.
In 2011, the FDP stopped focusing on clubs, and instead changed to follow their deficiencies.
As a result of this change in business model, which Roman Abramovich originally expressed in Chelsea in 2003, was to buy a club with a good potential, and then to severely deal with, in order to improve the team and create global branches, it became a difficult plan.
During the current three-year period of 2018, the clubs may have losses of 30 million.
And despite the injury of the Platins from the presidential station in 2015, his deputy Alexander Cheferin has still been determined to maintain excessive treaties.
“FPs are alive, and we are going to take the rules forward”, stated the Associated Press Agency Andrea Traverso, who controls the FIFP in the WEFA last week.
Although the PSH and pay the redemption of the Non-Parament at the same time, it may determine the amount for the whole time of its contract.
Neymar signed the five-year contract, so the transmission value could be shown in the annual report as costs of 44.4 million during the five years.
During the first wave of the ‘FP’ sanctions in 2014 to the PSH and to Abu-Daby Manchester City, the most difficult sanctions were applied.
The PSH was set up to 60 million dollars (including 82 million dollars), which later was reduced to 20 million, and was prescribed to set up its team in the League Champions during the 2014-1015 season by 21 players instead of 25.
The WEFA follows clubs that may try to interrupt its financial inspections by spreading their income on account of companies with the owners of the club.
Although the Katarian company could have proposed “PSI”, but if the amount of the sum had been estimated by a higher standard market estimates, the WEFA would not allow it to be considered legal income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014, when WEFA stated that the amount of PSH from the Catarr Tourism Office was exposed.
It was reported that part of the Non-SH in the PSH could be made by the Organizational Committee of the World Champion 2022 in Catarre.
But the PSH and Katar-2022 refused that Neymar would be the member of the world campaign, and such a manier could easily find the WEFA in.
The past sanctions imposed on the PSH indicate that the EPFA will be more able to follow any attempts to deal with the rules.
As reported on Wednesday, the WEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions with the PSH on the conduct of non-transfers.
They communicated with the Associated Press Agency under anonymity, since they are not authorised to discuss the position of the ACP.
According to the latest reported report, more than 10 million were reached in 2015-1016 in the carrier of 542,4 million.
The report in the last financial year has not been reported yet.
The ‘PSI’ expects that the arrival of Non-Ra will be a pleasant land for sponsor trades, sales of attributes and footballs from the team's logo.
The club assumes that trade will grow at least 30 per cent by a new player.
The Spanish liable tried to interrupt the transfer of Ne_BAR_affirming that the PSH would violate the financial "fair-fair" financially.
“This is a manifest case of “financing” with the club and the State””, stated the Spanish newspaper “AS” President La Ligi Habier Tebas, meaning that the final owner of the PSH is Katar.
Arsenala Trainer, Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American Magnatune, divides the doubts of La Liga's behaviour of the Club by State.
“This is all the consequences of the low participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football in the last 15 years,” said Hunger on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It is very difficult to keep the financial facility because the country may have many ways and many reasons to be presented by such a serious player.
The Order and the Place of Promise shall be determined by the President
Where and where the new Russian citizens will reach the faithfulness of the RF, the President will determine such amendments to the second reading of the respective law once the Committee of the House on the Law of Presidence and Construction.
A week ago, the deputats are inclined to determine the order of the provision of the law.
Children to 18 years of age will be released from the adoption of a currency curse, as well as the non-deeps, to the draft amendment to the Law on the Citizenship of the RF (the " Reports ") which the Committee will consider before reading at its second meeting on 11 July.
The idea of introducing the conviction on the entry into the RF citizenship, instead of the formal signature of the documents, supported President Vladimir Putin on 6 June in meeting with the Hossdam Science of Vice-Slavic Government.
The deputats made this idea in the form of amendment to the second reading to a legislative draft for the cancellation of the decision of civility to those who were then condemned for a number of crimes of terrorism or extremist nature: for example, for public invitations to terrorism or its public resources in the SMEs or on the Internet (No. 225.2. UCF), as well as for aircraft, carrying or water transport, but only if this is an action with terrorism (p. 411 UCF).
According to the legislative draft, its log was that by forming documents for citizenship, a person is signed under the promise of compliance with the Russian law - an extremism path, he violates this promise.
The draft legislation was introduced in April to Gosdom by the leaders of the opinion Fractions Vladimir Va’ev ("Single Russia"), Gennadiy Zuganov (KPF), Vladimir Girinski (LDR), Sergei Mironov (Russian Justice) and the Spiker GD Veceslov Wolodin.
19 May, the deputats adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the draft draft draft was approved by the GD Committee on Accommodation and Law, but it was renewed now.
It now states that the order of commitment will be established by the President of RF.
Earlier parliamentaries were prepared to describe the procedure directly in the Law on the Citizenship of RF, indicating that the ceremonie should be in a strict situation before the State Herb and Russian flag in the presence of the representative of MVD.
However, the text of the draft law did not understand where such action should be carried out - a series where possible the RF Herb, regulated by the respective federal constitutional law.
Their number includes courts, offices of the heads of the members' bodies, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of the Federal Authorities of Executive Authorities, etc.
Probably, that might be the ZAGS.
Promoting a competitive curse that wishes to receive the RF citizenship will be after the officers will check their documents.
However, the Russian passport will only be obtained after the swear is made from the text.
The project said that the swore should be signed before the signature of the sentence.
The updated text states that Russia ' s swearing will be from 18 years and not from 14 years.
The rule was maintained to be released from the prosecution of non-deep or strictly deep, as well as those who cannot say, read or sign the text of the oath.
In addition, President RF has the right to free from this procedure and "other persons"
The updated legislative draft also provides a series of acceptances in the Russian citizens of Ukraine, which are considered Russian carriers.
They should be officially rejected by the Ukrainian citizenship by providing an appropriate statement to the competent authority of Ukraine.
A notarily assured copy of the statement will be submitted to the Russian factors.
The refusal of "foreign" citizenship, as is now, will not be required if it is provided by a contract or if it is not "in force of non-dependent reasons".
The respective amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputats, including the first vice-picker GD Ivan Melnik (KPRF), Natalia Poklonska, Paul Krashinniks and Irat Farrachov (all "Single Russia").
I think many of you know that getting help from Ukraine is unreasonable, but it's not real.
A lot of people, respectively, explained the penalty of the Chapter of the Guest Committee and the Law of Paul Krashennik (ER).
Furthermore, the text indicated that the employment of certain debts for foreigners would not be extended to those who were writtenly rejected from the " other " citizenship and made an ancient passport to Russian VAT, but "without its reasons" did not stop consider it a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited to carry out posts in the municipal service to be adopted on objects and in the organizations which ensure the security of Russia.
A person with double citizenship or a kind of residence in another country may also not be a deputat of the House or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force from 1 September 2017 and that sub-legal acts should be prepared at that time.
Nostalgia becomes a nest in the "American Sore" and "Bonds creation"
The present history is notalgicly reminded of the famous days of personality in the 1980s; of the epoch of grange in the 90s (approximately when the master David Wayne and Michael Swalter made a commodity for MTV) and about itself before its stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Paul and Paul Radd, moved to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the exalting and enlargement of our time with its continuous reminders from Facebook.
But as a franche she's anacronism.
"The first day of the camp" was a good surprise, not only because of the absurdist humor (including the original history of the speaking bank of fruit, which H. John Benjamin sounded).
The result is a major challenge: Middle-age actors play sexually concerned children who have only reached age, and thus does not be able to return to a part of the shame.
"10 years later," where adults were played, they have less deep emotional roots, and their parenthood is more unsystemic and includes riffs from the 90th-year-old films of the "Hucky that rises collibe".
In one episode, the personality gets Apple Powerbook, four-cycle rolling horses and "cooking other things from 1991".
The same is the same.
Well-friendly Cooper (Shoolter), now the writer, has not yet gained mutuality from Cathy (Margerith Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) hasn't yet gone away with the virginity.
And there is still a foolish and foolish consequence in which Ronald Reagan (a.k.a. Shawolter), which is now encouraged by George Bush older (the tested patriarch of Michael Jan Blake).
Like always, the best part of the franchise is a decline from it.
It is particularly fun to see the everlasting Young Council, who sing the song of Matt Dillon from the "Single", whose ex-And's old person is now looking old.
This franchise could be successful by accidental foolishness in the spirit of the "Seven Up" recursive series until it arrives before it, I think, would be the logical end of it: "The American Mount Sore: twenty years later", where the whole company would go to the film on the "American Movie" film in the last scene.
The "Amazon Detectives" is referring to another type of nostalgia: the memories of the cold war from the Americans, the explosive blonds, or even the "Blesca" with its images of the East and the West.
This commodity created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaki with the recorder Rice Thomas from the television: the Romanian police drama of two police in Buharest, the fight for the truth, the atheism and the marine road of the Romanian police.
The main roles of Gregor's life and Joseph's idealist - play Florin Pyrsic the younger and Cornelius Uli, and play their dialogues in English in Chenning Tatum (the same executive manufacturer) and Joseph Gordon Levit.
It's a brilliant idea.
But just a idea.
There are a few visual shots (polises take time to watch the shoes on the shock, as the Americans could see football).
The order of votes in front of the frame, including Jenny Slayt, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevini, allows you to play interestingly in "remember the voice".
But the Detective Manufacturer is so detaining the likeness of an unexpected propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in the Ronald Raigan mask -- which often looks like it.
Six long episodes for the holidays, and it is not very and not often funny.
If he had made it quickly, the "Detective Detective" could better handle his satyry in the spirit of agitpropa; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American community, they are sitting in the newsbuild two narrow guys who swimming a bunch of hamburgers.
In the communist viewer, this picture says that western culture is able to make food.
The original Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our recent history, and with them.

The Bank of England will maintain percentage rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England later states that the rates will not be changed after economic growth and weakness of inflation have made hearing about the possible increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain unfair and left rate without changes between the pressure of the family income.
The Specialists of the Bank's Financial Policy Committee (MPC) voted with the result of 6 against 2 for the preservation of the rate at 0.25 per cent, and the smallest number of members of the Committee in this month was stated to increase the rate because the economic growth had decreased the support of increase.
In its quarter report on the inflation of the bank, the prognoses were increased by 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that the pressure on the family income would continue, while still expected that the inflation of the egg would rise to approximately 3 per cent.
However, the bank warned that the increases of rate within the next few years would be in order to control the inflation caused by breccacy, and stated that the costs of rate would probably be higher than expected in the financial markets.
The members of the Committee also vote in order to reject the part of the public complex measures for the development of the economy launched a year ago as a result of breccacith.
The beginning of February, the bank will close the plan of emergency which it provides to banks debt credits, although he has informed that he is now in the framework of the plan to provide more than 15 billion pounds to 115 billion pounds.
In the bank rates decision-making protocol, he said: “Soon the main MPC prognoses, the growth of the internal product (BDP) will remain slow in closer time, while the pressure on real family income continues to affect consumption.”
He repeatedly repeated that in order to stop inflation, “in some financial policies” will be needed in “increasing” than markets are expected.
The market is currently the first increase in the third quarter of the year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all increases would be "degrees" and "limited".
Bank ' s prognoses for increase in this and the year ' s below than the predictions made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
Bank left its unchanged prognoses of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After these newspapers, the starling fell on a dollar and a dollar.
Pounds fall from 0.5% to 1.31 dollars and 0.4% to 1.11.
The decision to not change the rate was taken after the recent increase indicators had weakened the growth expectation of increase; then the BDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter against 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, the growth, in all cases, remains at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will begin to grow at the end of the year.
The latest report of the bank on inflation is low to enjoy the households in which the high inflation has affected and is not significant: according to the bank, the pressure will increase before decreasing.
The Bank added that the financial policy “not can prevent” has been acquired by the following years, but expects that the payments of “significant” will be restored to the end of its three-year prognoses.
The economy is also focused on growth as a result of the current request for the British goods resulting in a low rate of pounds, which compensates part of decreased consumer expenditure.
The decision was taken a year after the rate was reduced to 0.25 per cent in August last after the shocking results of the referendum on the issue of the outcome of the Russian union, which led to the fall of the pound.
The bank's estimates, mostly, will need four years to have full impact on prices and economy.
Before the bank made its last decision on taxes, the sound of the estimated rate increased, since the inflation had increased the intense pressure of the households: three of the specialist committee asked to increase the rate to 0.5 per cent in July.
The inflation fell to 2.6% of 2.9% in July, although the bank report expected that the inflation was expected and recompensed in the next months.
According to the bank, a higher level compared to the planned 2 per cent is the result of a low rate of pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of the Coreco Hypotetic Brokers Company, said: "If a recent fall of supper courses, the hypothetic market will be again more competitive, since the creditors require business and account for a good end of the year.
The market seems particularly favorable to those who approach their contracts, since the refinancing of the credits, often with the possibility of the Commission to be disabled and with a low rate, becomes popular as never.’
The State Service of Health will provide a challenged dispute from HIV 10000 people
Since September, patients will receive access to the "revolution" medicine for HIV profiling after the battle in the High Court on the subject of the use of medicinal products from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that the pre-exposition profile of HIV (PPE), a tablet adopted before sex, which, as probably, reduces the risk of infection in persons in the risk group, in average of 86 per cent, will now be provided for a health service for a three-year testing period of approximately 10000 people.
She agreed to finance the trial after the appointment court had supported the establishment of the High Court last year, in which it was acknowledged that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay the EPA, despite its statement that it had to be held by the competent authorities.
This step announced on Thursday was called “the major new introduction” by the President of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National Office for Deployment Control (NAT) called it as a “reverse moment”.
Before the full initiation of the programme throughout England until April 2018, Venerological Dispansors in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and Shephilde will begin to register people, and more discharges will be accompanied by the programme in October.
The preexposition profile (PPE) is the rate of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
As shown in the studies, the EIB reduces significantly the risk of HIV infection among people in the risk group.
At the time of the receipt of the EP before sex in human body, the number of medicinal products is sufficient to prevent HIV infection.
Electrical medicines can be taken daily or not later than two hours before sex.
Patients with the right to get the medicine are homosexual and bissexual men, transgenders and people whose partners are HIV-local and have no successful treatment.
Discpansors will choose the appropriate participants, agree to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are not subject to an antiretroviral treatment of HIV status.
People who are entitled to the general doctor in England will also be able to make a request for potential participation in the nearest Venerological Dispanzer to participate in the programme.
The programme will cost 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England signed the Treaty on Medicinal Safety on this week after the international tender for purchasing.
The study was thus built to evaluate all the possibilities of the EP on the collection of clinical data about the purpose of the medicinal product, its approvability and application.
“This important introduction should be supplemented and enhanced by larger and more successful efforts aimed at preventing HIV.
This is another decades of success in combating one of the greatest threats to health with which the health is affected.
Debora Gold, President of the NAT (National Control Office for the Proliferation) said: “This is a return moment in combating HIV.
If it is gratefully encouraged to people, it needs help and risk, it can change the situation of HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people in the HIV risk group will receive access to the new opening new opportunities that can be able to control itself without discussing it with the partner that will lead to improvement in many lives.
We welcome this news bitterly."
Jan Green, president of the Terrens Higins Fund, said: “Now, firstly, we need to care that the test should be rapidly spread throughout the country, and that no one of the HIV risk groups should be forgotten.
Now, when we provide an experimental medicine, we are going to protect more than 10000 people in the HIV risk area."
Sheron Hodgeson, the Headquarters of the People ' s Health Minister, said, "We welcome the beginning of the testing of the EEP, it has been very disappointed for months of delays and delays from the Government."
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this medicine can be as part of our approach to prevent HIV and stop transmission of this rock infection.
This trial will draw us closer to the fully understanding of the benefits of the EP.
Now it is important that the trial is as far as possible throughout the country to protect people in the HIV risk group and to move us to steps towards the interruption of HIV distribution in society.

In Russia, there were difficulties in receiving guidelines
The GIBD Departments have experienced the deficiency of driver certificates.
To gain such rights, a few weeks should be waited, which has become a real problem for the refugees who want to go outside the border of their car or take it there.
It is important to note that the situation with driver certificates remains contrary.
The UNHCR was introduced to facilitate understanding of what is written in the national certificate, since the information in it is explained in five languages.
Requirements for rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Motion, but in countries, ratifying the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are also recognised.
However, everything depends on specific police or procurement offices: some require MFIs and some of the national rights.
In order to ensure, the rights of the drivers are still obtained, but it should be considered that the Convention of countries (e.g. the United States, Spain, Me ́ka, Indonesia) does not allow the authorities to recognize national rights or MFIs.

In the Cross-Yarsque, the MWU is not "for technical reasons" without detail, in the Samaritan area, honestly stated that there are no blacks, the similar situation is combined in other cities.
Many mosquitoes have already faced the problem, and in the souths the following reports are often presented:
Irina Burmistrova, "Do you think why you get rights in Moscow?"
That's right, 'cause all the GBDDs have finished.
Elena Podkolzina: "Ask for people who know!"
We need to get rights very urgent.
In Moscow, they have been killed all the time, and they are not issued on the stalons (but the talent can't be given).
Likely, the hostslave portal shows that the S.B. is free to fig.
Did anyone try to get in another city?
Does it come?
As explained in the MVD RF, the requirements for carrier certificates have been changed, thus the Gosavto Inspection Department on the delivery of new blankets.
This may have been a deficiency, truly, unexpectedly, what changes and matters were not reported earlier.
The banks bought the Centre for Road Safety (CSN BDD) MVD RF and then placed them in the GIDD Department.
In the past years, all contracts were concluded with the AO " Gosnak": nearly 200 thousand MWU banks were made in 2014-2015, 15 thousand blacks were purchased in 2016, in 2017 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July with the OOO " First Pressure Court" for 70 thousand blacks.
There's a version that the CSN just did not have a trender on time, so it was a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of blacks: because of the crisis, many people were not self-employed, but in more deep Asian countries, China, Thailand, and so far.
What rights are there, not clearly, so people are sure, so there has been a question of a "small" question.
Recently, professional drivers have to be tested under their deficiency.
With this proposal, Mintrans expressed.
The International Carrier Certificate (WHO) of the new model has been operated since 31 May 2011.
The Ministry of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe the building of the Crime Pool
Ukrainian Justice Minister Paul Peterenko stated that he did not believe Russia’s ability to build a pool in Creme.
On Friday, 4 August, he said in the "Obozrew" portfolio.
No international company that respects itself will not even set a bottle or a bottle there because it risks to lose its business in the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries which have been accompanied by the sanctions against Russian Crime.
"It is my deep conviction, but it does not really have this project," Peterenko said.
He added that Russia felt that it was unable to enhance a major infrastructure project self-subordinated.
Russia can not normally build less scaled objects.
I know that after Olympiade in Sochi, the whole stadiums have already been disrupted.
"This is why, I think, the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so invisible to join this project," said the factor.
On 31 July, the builders completed the conclusion of the Crymean Power Card.
On the leadership, an enhanced assembly of the Cryme's ark has been completed: its co-operation will be locked at 45 metres of the co-action.
"The pools at the same time have prepared for the establishment of railway oppositions," reported the project's intentional center.
In April, Chapter of Mintrans, Mr. Sokolov was informed by President of Russia Vladimir Pu, that the exhibition of the object and with the attention of the graphics.
The Crimean Pool is combined with the Crimean Half Islands and the Cross-Darean Territory.
In Spain, a factor was released that wasn't walking 10 years.
What, then, did the angelic patience (or absolutely unlikelity to the State Service) have to be possessed by the leader of the Spanish Chief Carles Resio?
Permanent transition was spent for 10 years.
Nevertheless, Mr. Resio was released.
But not your direct leader.
What's not going on in the world of bureaucrates.
It seems to have been used for a long time to all the "serve of the people".
Yet, the factors are always able to surprise those on whom they will be charged.
This time the "sensation" was grateful to Spain.
There the Valence of Carles Resio has been wise not to go on for ten years.
In this way, he received a complaint.
The whole solemn thing is 50,000 per year.
And here Mr. Resio's "wonderful times" ended.
He was released by the law of Valencia's meeting.
In the investigation, it was discovered that the evil player came to the office every morning at 7:00 a.m. to note in the electronic system.
And I went home right here.
Once again, he appeared on the slave at 4:00 to note that he was gone again.
And that's 10 years.
Moreover, it was possible that all the free time the player was dedicated to the drawing of comics at home.
Now the Deputats of Valencia's Law's meeting think how to punish Mr. Resio's direct leader, who could not know how to "work actively" on his slave's subject.
The judges will protect from the Presidents
The Chairman's Human Rights Council, on the mandate of Vladimir Pu, repeated proposals for strengthening the independence of the judicial fruit of the authority.
It will be the power of the presidents of the courts and the election of them.
For the courts of the Appeal and Cassational Instances, ↓CH wants to introduce special areas that will not be linked to the administrative and territorial share in the RF.
The Supreme Court should also provide its proposals in the framework of the Chairman's mandate.
›H has completed the proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This was conducted by Vladimir Pu, on 3 January 2017, which was president after meeting with the members of the Council.
At meetings with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016, the cases of the judge were discussed from where, as well as the issues of public control in the citizens' places (see " A " of 9 December").
The outcome of the work was 25 proposals, which were addressed as issues of the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors, as well as of courts and jurisdiction of education.
One of the cremlew rightsguardians is the power of the presidents of the courts to enhance the independence of the rest of judges.
If the court candidate has successfully passed the concurrence and has been supported by the court community, the President of the Court, according to the Court's opinion, should be held to be appointed without the right to deny how this law allows now.
It is also proposed to lose the Chairman's right to resolve cases for consideration between judges.
Experts allow this to do this may be a specially written computer program.
The President also believes that it is not able to "determine the results of the trial of the judge's testing, initiate it in the disciplinary responsibility, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments".
In this context, the presidential Council considers it to go to "the election of the presidents of the courts by the own judges" and "to grant them the powers of a relatively continuous period of rotation".
All the presidents of the vessels (from the Republic of the Danish to the circuits) are now appointed by the President of the High Court of Justice for six years.
In order to rebuild judges from the pressure of the regional administrations, Others will re-organize a claim and a case in the courts of the general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial share in the RF.
"Only, it is necessary to ensure a departmental and cassational bodies non-regional judicial bodies in the RF subjects, but in the court areas."
Experts are based on the arbitrary vessels.
They are "districts" which are not compatible with the administrative share in the RF but which guarantee great independence from regional operators who are difficult to use the "phone right".
The World Courts will strengthen the national meetings in order to examine some " civil and administrative categories" with their participation.
For example, the lack of parents ' rights, the restoration of the rights, the protection of honour and dignity, the lack of driver rights, etc.
"This is only our proposals," explained the "E" member of the Constitutional Court of Justice of Tamar Morštakov.
She also pointed out that the Chairman ' s mandate was not only to the Other Court but also to the Supreme Court, who had not yet discovered its proposals.
There is still a time to carry out the mandate of the BC (in the middle of the Officers, Gene-Procurature and human rights authorised in the RF).
To add Vladimir Putin to the effectiveness of justice in the RF, the chairman of U.S. Viceслав Lebedev must be held until 1 September.
Living a high life: Half-eating and nice designer receipts have converted this small apartment to Erls Cort into a space apartment
Joan Lee, an ex-banker who was aware of the immobility reform, moved from the space home in Nitsbridge to the apartment to Erls Cort in 2014.
The apartment is on the first stage of the sympathy house in the style of Queen Anna, and for the benefit of the new design, Joan has not collected his things and has not moved again.
"I lived with my former Nitsbridge on a lot greater area," says Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable to my money.
This apartment was shown to me in Erles Cort, and there were the same high decks here.
I loved it and offered a price on the same day."
Since the first review of the apartment, the floor of 1000 square feet has been transferred to the full floor.
It was essentially a apartment with one complex room planning - to get into the room, it had to pass through the kitchen - and John wanted to add spaces to store things and half-case so that it would have a good benefit from the height of the milk.
"I wanted high winds, big windows, many lights.
"That was my demands," she says.
To this end, she took Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hille Techno Designer Studio Duck & Shed to expose a half of 12,5 feet height and create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project but would be worth Joan for life.
The floor was not enough to set up two places above each other, therefore the task was to create a half-case where it could be fully grown.
Ear had to think creatively to cope with the brif.
“The work with stakeholders is very complicated”, explains he.
"We had to set the places so that they would be over each other, and they would not have been destroyed.
It was not simply to build a simple formula, but to focus on the action that they would be at the right height and allow them to use spaces above and below.”
This decision allowed E. to set up two full-dimensional commitments over each other in the landscape and more interesting.
From half-case through the vintage light light window from Retrovuius is opened a look at a shocked holiday downstairs.
Star mobile with golden , silver accents and vintage mechanisms from Serja Muya behind the project style.
The exposure of the stars plays a role in adding visibility, space and light.
The short corridor is wrapped with stars so that it seems to be longer.
In the kitchen, a star protective panel with a window in another comma.
In the entrance of the winter, shops serve to keep the whole stock of Joan.
In order to create a more nice space, the beauty of the holiday can be a cooking when it does not use it.
There is nothing new in cooking.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's going up to the door, like in the garage.
“The engineering experience has been exercised here”, says E.
"There is the opposite, so when you put the door on the top, it will be very easy."
Joan has received additional 16 square metres, additional room and improved planning.
"After all, the field of sex is what you will sell, that is, what your independence is evaluated," says Ear.
“It is cruel to say that the trade agent will enter into and make accounts in the field of sex.”
Here they have been able to increase the field of sex using quality materials that provide the space of the rosh.
"The materials are what we are touching, so they have helped to create a emotional relationship with the house," says Ear.
"No one loves the electricity in the walls.
It is vital, but it is not for our hearts.
This testifies that, as a good design and increased meter of the apartment, it can be transformed from something of normal.
Actually, as Joan, you can decide to stay.

MI: UNSO warriors in secret are agreed with Donbass' military officers
On the line of inflammated opposite in Donbass, a regular phone connection is located.
The fighters of opposing parties are continuing to communicate with each other on mobile phones, and they do not know that in the states.
The WTO fighters and Donbass' officers have made a communicate on modern phones secretly from their high command.
This is reported on 4 August by Stara.ua with military operation participants in Donbase.
According to the issue, the officers know their colleagues with the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily.
Communication is totally not viable: Commanders are trying to achieve some "tactic agreements".
The results of these include reconciliation in a certain part of the front.
The journalists were aware of the cases when the officer received a congratulation with the birthday from the front line.
WTO fighters and DNA and LNR groups are sitting on the border line from 2014 when Ukraine started a fighting oper against Donbass.
MIDI has made the locking of UN SB statements on attacks against the RF
In the Russian outermost awareness, the action of a separate west diplomatic representative that blocks the United Nations statements in the press condemning the terrorism of the RF missionary in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian IMI.
The Russian missionary territory in Damascus, 2 August, three times a month, was subjected to a minometric shot by terrorists by the " Hayat Tahrir Ash-Sham" grouping (ex-Jabhat an-Nusra, prohibited in RF) and "Filak Ar-Rahman".
Taking into consideration that the international community is unilaterally in the fall of the " Nurse " as a terrorist of the organization, and the UNSB resolutions call to resist this structure, the MIDI RF noted that " it would be seemed that the " Nauss" terractions should meet a totally unconditional and determined condemnation, and in the assessments of the outcome against diplomatic representations there should be no double-sensitivity."
However, as stated in the Differential, "for the third time in the month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council, differently by distinguing the tonality of the expressions, covering evidence that there was no information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short proposal for the Security Council's statement for pressure with the conviction of terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomate in the Syrian capital."
The unwantedness of showing a double solidarity with us will remain in the conscience of these delegations.
"The most comforting thing that the security Council's insufficiency to condemn terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorists, gives them a sense of impunity," they stated in the MED and added, "no wishes that those barbars have a conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them."
Vladimir Putin expressed the number of non-planned business checks
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin, at the meeting on investment projects in the Nether East, stated that the number of non-planned entities should be reduced to 30% of the number of plans, as well as stated that the period of inspection was necessary for ten summers.
"Independent checks of the procurement are usually not relevant; only 2-3 per cent is covered with the prosecutor, all other and self-subordinated," cites the President of TAS.
Vladimir Putin also said that the investigators should be prohibited to remove servers and hard disks on businesses.
In addition, the President considers that business unions should have the right to protect the interests of their members in the court.
"This, I hope, will introduce a certain position in the consideration of cases with undertakings or violations of law in the field of undertakings," said the Chapter of the State.
As the " E" reported, the number of other types of enterprise inspections have been carried out because of the operation of planning checks.
In May, the Business Ombudsman of Russian President Boris Titova was commissioned to investigate the fact that the replacement of planning checks on non-scheduled non-schedules (a percentage of 21,9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), the prosecutors (16.9% to 21.8%), the rates (7.9% to 13.3%), as well as the statement checks of citizens (15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).

Brothers fight for the empire of immobility with more than $500 million
Two brothers fight for one of the greatest in Victoria Empires in the trade of more than 500 million dollars - forty years after their Italian forefathers were based on dynamic.
The former director of the Football Club of Carlton and Colon de Lutis lives in Turak's court through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who asked against him to the Supreme Court of Justice for the Department of Heritage and Assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but in the Supreme Court, he has been disappointed on the conditions of divorce.
However, with their mother Anna, the brothers have 87 objects of more than half billion dollars purchased from the poor as their family bought a store at Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family was based on the "Westco Jeans" company, which grew up on a network that contained 160 trade points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was involved in the insurance, and the list of family possessions of De Lutis includes today office comments, buildings in Brunsvic and Sorrento, apartments in the Golden Gulden and Mount-Buller and trading centres in the villages.
According to the agreement with Colin's father, whom Paul describes as "the main movement force and the dominating person" of De Lutis, the family has approximately two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul is about one third.
According to the Court, this means that Colina's property consists of 316 million and Paul is 176 million.
Association of property and money for Paul before payment.
"The Order proposed by Columbus gives him the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first statements in 2015.
On Wednesday after several failures to conquire, the first audiences in the Supreme Court had passed.
The brothers will now be concerned about who will control the business of which, as Paul said, Colin has excluded.
Colin claims that this is not true, but he accuses Paul in the incompatible management of some objects.
In comments of Colin at the beginning of the process, he says that it is expected to be authorised.
"My Italian roots call me to be the highest priority of the family," he wrote.
Court expenditure will be as snow com: hundreds of signs, emails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck ́mer; both sides have attached the most important parts, including the King Alan Mayers, and the best.
Mrs. De Lutis and her relaxed wife Louise were immigrants from Italy; since the end of the 1950s, they managed milk bars and gastronomes and bought a magazine in Brunswick at the beginning of 1970s.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family store of genes.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last school classs, and Paul was a boy (approximately 10 years)".
Anna De Lutis says that they and Louise, who died in 2012, hoped to deliver their own inheritance to sons without conflicts.
"Luji often told me that he didn't want the brothers to understand the court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer in the group of De Lutis; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he went out of the business and Luke 26 million.
Paul, and Luke, and Mark, said that they were "insufficient financial conditions of their own."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL Club Directors Council and, repeated in 2015, Eddie’s lifegraphy, the best friend of the telescope.
"Ferfax Media" joined Colin and Paul on Friday and their own.
Only Colin, a text message in which it was said, since the case has not yet been discussed in the court, "I'm really nothing to say."
"I'm very sorry that my brother Paul decided to give me a request and to blame our family's name in the court," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in evidence that he was trying to meet the brother's requests.
"Our father wouldn't want to see how Paul and I are in the court," he added that "he still hopes for a solution to the conflict."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be spread.
"The decision on our case will soon be judged," wrote Colin.
The new Chapter of the Trumpa equipment plans to provide information to the President.
Others tried to do this and suffered damage.
Maybe John F. Kelly's really gonna do it.
In that case, he'll be the first.
The "Politic" reports that the new Chapter of the White House plans to provide a flow of information to President Trompe, including news reports from the MMI, hoped to keep the boss in a quieter state.
That's what reporter J'Douzy reports.
"In the meeting held by the new Chapter of the White House, John F. Kelly, with the leader of the equipment on his first slave day, he designated the main problem in the White House at President Donald Trompe, which he hopes to decide: bad information channels to the President."
Kelly said to the people that information should be passed through it - in a paper form or in a brifiny - because the President would be better to make decisions if he would receive regular information.
The diagnosis of Kelly is completely faithful, but others have already suffered a failure in trying to calm the Trump, following information to him.
The relations of President Trompa with television have been made a few decades ago - and now, when he is in the White House, his habit of watching the television is still.
"When Trump, as a candidate, was unfair about the campaign, was worth showing him that he had been justified in the issues that could be convinced," said in February, "Politics" with Nanberg, former electoral adviser.
Tara Palmer wrote then in "Politic" that "six would be the members of the electoral station to keep the Trompe's custom to write to Twitter, it should be observed that there should be a continuous stream of praise in his personal approach."
Okay.
But the idea that Trumpa's custom to write to Twitter was ever "under control" is just funny.
Maybe these members of the electoral station know something we don't know, for example, that if they weren't, the Trumpa's twins would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the twins that Trump did not up.
If he had been hostile at least several times, their efforts were not valid.
But no one was able to keep the Trump on the fire of the oil.
A part of the problem is that in the White House divided by opposing fractions, people are continually trying to move their programme by giving the Trump material to be confidential or not, which confirms their views.
"Politics" -- just to this story -- wrote in May about the inclination of advisers to submit to the Chairman of suspicious information.
This is one example described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"The present and former terms of Trump say that the Trump can react very rarely to the press reports, particularly containing dangerous information refugees, and it will not be quiet until the best of them standing behind.
This happened at the end of February, when someone sent the president to print the article with GotNews.com, the web site of K. Johnson's producer, where Cathy Walsh's head was accused of being "near running" at the White House.
It is not worth that Johnson is forever disappointed in the Twi for the aggressive behaviour that he did not have specific facts or that in the past he had committed false accusations and then refused them.
Thrump read the article and accepted the question of Wells."
Goldmacher adds that the current head of Rains Pribus and the secretary of the Rob Porter apparatus were trying to build a system to manage the stream of Boo-boy, which gets Tromp, and document them.
How was that?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same.
It may be more effective than Pribus, but Trump still impulsive nature, and its assistants continue to fight each other for the influence.
These continuous factors make Kelly a very difficult task.
The German prosecutor fights HIV-dissident
The prosecutor insisted on the establishment of the Kalinian Rice Tumeni, who stopped the voting case in relation to the residence in which HIV had ended a little-year-old daughter.
According to the consequence, the child was lost because the mother was a HIV-dissident and refused to treat.
However, the court released her from the responsibility for reconciliation with her daddy father.
The prosecutor believes that crime would be left without punition so that it would not create a preliminary for other HIV members.
The case on the residence of Tumenia was raised at 1st. 109 UC RF (the cause of the death of an im caution) in April after its three-year daughter died from HIV infection 4V.
According to the prosecutor, the mother itself is HIV-infected.
"The woman has not treated herself and has been treated from her daughter's treatment, thinking that HIV infection doesn't exist," explained in the German Procurement.
The Court of Auditors of California, who decided on its interruption on 25 July.
The mystery of this gave the father of the dead girl, explaining that "the woman had no complaints to her, she disappointed and made excuses."
The prosecution with the decision of the Court did not agree and granted an appointment, requireing a cancellation of the suspension of the case and to submit it to a new consideration.
The girl died, and the offence caused by a crime is not a matter.
A HIV-infected mother, despite the recommendations of doctors from the investigation and treatment of a small infection," reported the prosecutor in the press service.
According to the supervisory body, it must be punished, other HIV-dissidents, otherwise follow her example.
As stated in the prison Centre of AIDS, about 12 children of HIV disease are now not obtaining medical assistance because they refused their parents.
"And this situation has already improved - for the year of the special group, half of parents, the category refusing to treat children from HIV, changed their opinion - allowed diagnostics to be diagnosed, taking medicines," -- the race of the press secretary of the Centre of Helen Losev.
It says that the law does not have any effect on parents, and not all HIV infected children are able to find - mothers do not allow them to investigate, hide, escape with children from the hospital.
The risks of HIV-dissidents
At the end of the past year, Petersburg sociologists held the results of the first investigation in Russia of HIV-dissident movement.
HIV-dissidents call people who refuse HIV and refuse to take medicines.
Medicines and activists of Serbian NGOs call such views anthemidic and seem to be severe threats in their distribution.
The bitter session, which ended with the tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, on the iron of the Greek in Hmelnic.
A pleasant company of young people walked through the pool over the railways, where the train was once.
One of the friends had the idea of making an effective wagon seller, reporting the FACTAM in the communication sector of the police in the Hmelnic area.
The boy started to get down from the pool to the bathroom, but because of his invisibleness, he was thrown over the electrotransport line and was hit at the moment.
Fortunately, this case has been a prospector of the employment, which immediately called a "release".
Before the arrival of the painful doctors were moved to a safe place, and then hospitalization was moved to the bullet of the hospital's area.
Mans were diagnosed with 1 to 2 degrees.
The doctors now appreciate it as a stability.
Protectors recall that in recent times, all large populations have been obtained by extreme landscapes on the cross-borders of polyesters, pools that move to transport.
The police invites people to be watchful and not allow such sessions, especially among children and adults.

Municipality should be shameful and injured because they are unable to solve this problem.
The cigans were here in May, they were lost, and they returned again.
Last night there were more cigans and maybe more.
"Birmingham's Municipality knows how to resolve this problem, they receive long-term judicial arrangements to protect their parks," she added.
I'm on Streetsb's road, and I don't like that I continue to keep the municipal tax, and the Municipality can't even end this."
One of them who wanted to be anonymous said, "This is funny, we have just seen that the cigarettes passed away in the past, and, please, this attack continues."
This time they have become more, and We have even seen the winds of the rock.
The representative of the Municipality of Solihala said: "We know about an illegal camp on the earth near Streetsb' road and cooperate with the Solihal's family; we do legal acts with the way we can go away."
To help us in the collection of witnesses, it is vital to report as far as possible any antisocial or criminal behaviour on telephone 101.
This allows the presentation of a situation that will consider the court when we are going to do our case with them.

The Ministry of Agriculture of Crime stated that if there are no funds for modernising undertakings within the next three years, there will be a threat to removal.
The expenditure of the main funds to the undertakings consists of 60-70%.
Modernized enterprises need 1.2 billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion
What remains is not enough for the modernisation plan.
"To obtain money from the owner hardly, talking about business funds of large credit organisations in operation," said the Cryme Sergei Petellin Minselhose in April this year.
The Cryme Parliament included the undertaking in the prognoses plan of privatisation for 2017.
It was proposed to take action and to make the markets.
The Interfax source in the Cryme authorities was the value of the sale of undertakings in $40 million, the investment in modernization of $30 million.
The New World in 2016 increased the production of playing wine by 2.8% compared to 2015 to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World was intended to release 1.6 million bottles.

The bathroom is divided by 11 hectares of the earth.
Lower citizens have disgraced more than 40 overbursts
The GWI partners in the Lower-State have established citizens' persons, spread 46 bursts on the city of Liskovo.
Three class students were deceived by the wrongdoers.
The first statement that the tombs were not harmful was made to Russia ' s OMVD on the Lisco area on 27 June.
In this respect, 24 people were addressed in the field.
Consequently, the voting case under article 244 of the RF " Destruction, pollution or pollution of the preservation" was urged.
Following the consequences, the police have established the suspicious, and they have been two school students of 8 and 9 years.
Injurious criminals told the police that they were interesting to see how the memories were fallen, and that encouraged them to promote the adverse action.
Children and their parents have a prophecy.
Italy is too low to the NGO ships that save migrants.
Italy warned that NGOs who belong to the Saving Courts in the Mediterranean would not be able to continue unless they were subject to new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs are not subject to the new behaviour code, it is difficult to say whether they can continue their activity," said the Minister for Internal Affairs of Mario Minniti at the interview of the tourine daily newspaper Stampa.
The warning of Minniti was on the day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, with a doubt that its equip actually cooperates with people traded and facilitates illegal immigration.
The humanitarian complaint on the whole year has been made from comments on the detailed accusations issued against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartosio.
"The salvation of life for us is and remains a higher priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot now continue in the search and salvation area," states the organization in the Society.
"We will be able to appreciate all the accusations that have been issued now only after all information and we can evaluate the situation."
The Italian authorities have followed the Juventa ship, which belongs to Jugend Rettet from October.
His team is suspicious that he has saved the ships of migrants to the ship of people who have been spent to them and allowed the contrabandists to go with ships that they could use again.
At least one meeting, as it is supposed to have only 1,3 miles from Libya, is approved in the materials of accusation that the content was repeated in the Italian SMEs.
The team is suspicious of the violation of the provisions of the Italian authorities, which control the rescue of operations in this area, more than for any other reason.
The Code of Behavior assumes, mainly, that the Court of Juventy will have the Italian police's board, which will monitor their activities.
Until only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations agreed to be subject to the code: "Spasti Children", Malta MOAS and "Pro-Activa Distributed Volumes" from Spain.
Following its statement on Thursday, the new rules were considered unnecessary but acceptable when they would not take any " significant changes or interruptions" to the operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is also the Nobel Prize " Doctors Without Border" (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that a rare reduction in the last weeks of migrants coming to Italy as a result of the salvation of operations indicated that the efforts to support Libyan Language Protection and cooperation are resulting.
"In the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported plans for further negotiations with the Libyan measures on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope of reaching them.
"We don't want to associate with any of the conflicts in Libya."
Recently, RFs have noticed that their policy has been actived in Libya and have participated in the delegations of opposing Libyan parties with visits in Moscow.
The Chapter of the Russian Contact Group for Internal Resolution in MID RF and Gosmond, Lev Dango, assistant of the Chapter of the Czech Republic, told " E" what objectives Moscow is pursuing in this region and to whom he is taking a rate.
About the Libya contact group you're mentioning, it's almost nothing.
So, let's say, the Ukrainian contact group -- everyone knows about it.
And here's the secrets.
What exactly do you do, what goals are you pursuing?
The contact group was established at the initiative of MID RF and State statement.
Its activities are purified by the foreign minister of Michail Goddanov and Adam Delimhan (Deputat of the Words from Chechen. - " E").
Last authorised to work in the Libyan direction by the Hosmad Slave of Vice Slave.
The establishment of the group was a detention in Libya of the Russian Dancer Mechanic Chebotarov (11 persons on board in September 2015).
We've been looking at how to help the team.
There was then a contact group of military experts, representatives of Gosdam, supported Chapter Chechen Ramsan Kadirov.
How did you do that exactly?
Since I have worked for Libya since 2008, I have been invited to address the group.
Our activity was not being freed from the Chebotarev Mechanics.
We have been able to contact the representatives of all major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripole (which is based by the United Nations recognition of the Government in the head of Faiz Saradž. - " E") and Tobruc (the representation of the parliament who is opposed to the Government and supports the Haftara Marshall, which controls the east regions of Libya. - " E")
As a result of the active participation of Ahmed Metig (the Vice-President of Libya " E "), we have quickly agreed on the release of Russian mariners.
Then it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Her task is an analysis of circumstances, detection of key factors and players, dialogue with all sides of the conflict.
I want to emphasize: in Libya we don't want to associate with any of the conflicts, we're dialogueing with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group, and how many of them are still in Libya?
Five people are now in the contact group.
There are among them people who have experience in power structures, including in the Defence Minister.
We also want to introduce a group of specialists on the region, representatives of the Middle East Institute.
Permanently, there is no one in Libya in our lives, yet there is no need.
Are there now Russian military advisers and actors in Libya?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military experts in Libya.
It is not a matter of reality.
But the former warriors are in your contact group...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit the heat points.
Or closed for us until a certain time, cities such as Missurat (based on groups of campaigns playing a role in the companion of Libyan leader Muammar Kaddafi in 2011 and notedly actived in the following years.
We came to Missurate in January this year.
We were scared, they said that all islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to appreciate the situation there, to analyze the real military potential that answers the reasons for hearing such as is the role of islamists.
In Missurate, we met all the representatives of the offices in Syrte (the city at the Middle-Sea in December 2016 was rejected by the fighters prohibited in Russia " Islam State " - " E ").
We wanted to see them, to meet these people, to verify that they had just played a decisive role in the IG in Libya, not Calif Haftar, who had assigned these services.
And what conclusion did you come to?
The Islam State in Libya won not Haftar?
He wasn't doing this.
Haftar did operations on the other front, in Bengazi.
And the IG in Syrte was held by the structures undergoing the Government in Tripole.
And, in fact, we invited people to Russia to conduct this anti-terrorist oper.
And they arrived - the visit was extended from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegate adopted in the Council of the Federation, in Dume, the Middle and Rosgwarddia.
You, as we realize, are in all Libyan regions and probably represent the setting of elite and field commanders.
How do you think that you will be able to conclude agreements on the end of July in Paris, Halif Haftar and Faiz Saradž?
Or again, how has this occurred once in the past, the agreements will be breaked, the fighting action will be renewed, the parties will try to take a single authority?
For us, a good signal has already been the fact that Saradge and Haftar agreed to a regular meeting, that has not been so long.
In the past, both leaders were extremely negative.
What's the case of Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow is actively supporting Haftar, and many believe in it.
We faced this situation when we were in Missurate, and Haftar was just on that day on the board of the Russian Aviationist Admiral Kuznec.
That was a coincidence.
But they did not believe in Missurate.
We said, "You are probably very courageous people who came to us today."
But our task is just to show that we are not only supporting Haftar, we are dialogueing with all the key participants of the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar have communicated.
Is it easier to understand with Russian partners at a emotional, emotional level that he has been learned at the SSR twice?
And then, does Haftar know Russian language?
He's Russian if he knows, he's very ambiguous.
But what he learned is, of course, easier dialogue with him.
And not only with him.
When we communicate with the soldiers in Tripole and Missurate, we meet generals who have learned in Russia or still in the Soviet Union.
And that's what they're talking Russian.
And they're drawing to Russia, sometimes testing the nostalgic.
Do you consider the probably cancelled by the Libya Army Bargo?
Are your Libyan conferences interviewed with Russian weapons?
Of course, they are interested, but, as I already said, we do not have any side in this conflict and we don't want to hurt one another.
We would like all to be located in some places.
As it comes to the airborn bargo, the Libyans are continuing to call for Russia to make some advantage of it.
The process of constitution is now active in Libya.
We hope that the parties will come to compromise decisions and will take advantage of the internal consensus.
Then the elections were to be made at the meeting of Saradja and Haftar.
If the elections are held and the finally selected authority (and no such status is now owned), the United Nations can be asked about the exhibition of the armed bargo in Subez.
To address this issue is now insignificant and dangerous, it will only lead to the scale of the conflict.
At the time of the MMI, Italia, who faced the problem of the African refugees from Libya, feels to be dismissed by the EU's judges.
Can Moscow in this situation help Italian partners using their connections with libanians?
For example, how is the argument that Haftara's offices will be controlled by life and put the end of the business of contrabandists transfering immigrants into?
Very timely question.
We work on this actively.
The Italians need to support Russia because Moscow is a dialogue at the same time with Haftar, and with Saradge, and with Missurate and the south of the country.
And in this matter, the tribes in the south of Libya play a great role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
What about the Southerns to cross the flows of migrants on further steps?
So, constantly, did the buses return in which the Nigerian migrants are coming?
We're getting it.
But it's not easy.
The clans and groups are concerned that these flows continue to go.
We hope to promote the integration of the south in the negotiating process between Sarding, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But for the beginning, we would like to see the unity of opinions on this issue between Haftar and Saradge.
The head of the Government in Tripole Faiz Saradge is considered a islamist, a part of the introduction into the country of Chariate standards.
How radical is he holding?
Will this not be an obstacle to deal with Russia or Western?
I'll tell my personal opinion about him.
I think he's, in contrast, the opposite of the radical islam.
But the islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya must be a absolutely normal country - a moderate island, open world.
He also acts actively with terrorists.
Where did he have such a reputation?
It is created by countries that are not interested in communicating with Russia with Tripoli.
The Tripolis is a hundred, there is a law, executive and judicial authority.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not going there.
And we all mixed their cards and started to communicate actively with Tripole and Tobruc.
And we have already feeded the fruits of this work: The growth has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the Governing Oil Company of Libya - NOC.
Director of the NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with which head of Rosnefty Igory Secin concluded an agreement, directly from Tripole.
And two weeks ago, the first deterioration of the Libyan oil of the Rosneft company.
What will Russia do with her?
I guess I'm going to sell.
What other economic interests have Russia in Libya?
Resign the contracts held at Muammar Kaddafi.
Speaking and, in particular, on ancient transport agreements (road road building), energy (electricity) and some other.
And there's something to do with the liquors?
Well, they have oil.
That's what Iran's case, and what about the "oil exchange of services" scheme?
I don't know what the scheme will be. I'm not doing this directly.
Actually, the economy for Russia in Libya is not primarily.
We're really there in peacekeeping.
For us, it is primarily to stop blood flowing, to help the liquors to agree with each other so that they can set up their orders and Libya has stopped to be a pleasant environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task to help the people of Libya and to release terrorists from there.
Do you have data about the presentation in Libya (actually or earlier) of Russian radical fighters or other countries of the former SSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to explain it.
I met with the representative of the Libyan Security Committee, who said that there was no exile from Russia and other countries of the former SSR today.
He said that he had approximately 50 thousand phone records of representatives of islamist and radical groups (in Libya). The Russian word does not sound there.
And what of the states, then, are these battles?
I wouldn't want to get in these details.
Then let's formulate the question otherwise.
How many of the battle-islamists in Libya's own libyans?
The Levites are not almost among them, they are not more than 5 per cent.
The rest is the next.
Can Moscow conduct internal negotiations like Paris?
There are plans.
We are taking active negotiations with Libya, several delegations of Libya have already visited Moscow and have stated that we are willing to come to Moscow or to Grosno.
And when can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
There must be several visits, and then I hope that there will be clearness in the course of time and place of negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, well-factors collected money on a dear gift of a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy Sasha Maksola, whose DCP, hydrocephalia and full blindness, will receive a specialized escape trace on 5 August.
The Benefit Representative of the Moscow Cultural Ministry of Oxan Kosarev and the Constantin Bobkov Museum.
The money for the trainer was collected during the "Don't stop doing good", which passed in Melchisha on July 15th of the Memorial of Chech.
Moraphon in the museum received from Sashi, a village in Manuskino of the Czech region, write, "I don't see the eyes, so I asked Mom to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a run trace in a gift, so that my feet would become low, and I'd soon learn to walk."
And there's Sashin's laughing!
After entering the Museum, the Concert-Poscritum will be a Pianoist, the Russian artist Alexander Hindin, who is deserved to carry out the popular classic products.
During the prosperous maraphon in Melicova, the Hor of Bosnesen David's wilderness, called the Master Illy Drozdihin, students of the Moscow Conservator name P.I. Chikov and Russian Academy of Gnesians, artists of the Melychov Theater "Chehow Study".
For visitors there were an auction, a bookmark and a favourable sale of subventive products from the maraphone logo.
The Museum of Melichov spoke with the initiative to make the Memory of Chech on July 15, one day of charity in all the submoskovian museums.
The 30-year-old resident of Olivska of the Vitomirian area near the football stadium shot several times to the side of the growths that were located there.
According to the suspicious, it was disappointed, the " FACTAM" reported in the communication of the Life Pacific Police.
After that, the man entered a coffee nearby.
He believed that there was a conflict in which the man applied the device to shoot the rezin pulls and hurt one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old sufferer has been given medical assistance, and his life is not threatened.
Police and medical assistance arrived in the place of the event, but the arrow has been hidden to this time.
He was established by the rightguardians and arrested on the same day, 2 August.
To explain his actions, a man wasn't drunk.
He has an output device for the shooting of rain bulls sent to the expertise.
According to this fact, the cohesion production was initiated by page 296 (Huliganity) of the Code of Ukraine.
The detained will threaten the detention of freedom for a period of 3 to 7 years.

Missel Carter's sentence for communications encouraged to suicide Conrad Roy
The inhabitants of Massachusetts were sentenced to two and a half years of conclusion that it, using text communications and telephone sounds, encouraged her battlefriend Conrad Roy to kill.
Michel Carter, who is now 20 years, will take 15 months after the end and five more years of testing.
Carter was recognized in June as a guilty of unpredicted murder of Conrad Roy, who ended with her on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said on the hearing on Thursday, "My family was killed by a burning.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free before the appointment.
She threatened the maximum time for 20 years, but hers said that she and Roy had suffered with psychical disappointments.
Carter, dressed in red bricks and cream black, listened to the sentence of standing, burning his hands and rejecting the eyes.
"They killed Conrad Roy by her actions," said the prosecutor.
"He stopped his life to improve his own.
She didn't recognize the responsibility," she said.
"He's not a racial demonstrator."
But Carter said that it was a "tragic case that she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monnis said that, according to his opinion, "the age, the level of adultness or even psychic disease did not have a noteworthy effect on her action".
The accuser read the statement of Mother Roy Linn Roy, which says: "No one day I would not pay for my favorite son's loss.
I want him to be proud of me and of how I do -- I'm trying to support his sister, despite all the pain that remains with us forever," says it.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was unrelevantly pursuing the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become a teat of his children.
"A man who was always with me from my birth is a pain that will remain with me until the end of my life," she said.
This case seems to be a legal president, since there is no law in Massachusetts that would be responsible for the advice of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found in the car dead with the symptoms of coal gas dead, Carter was 17 years old.
He focused on all the country when it was implied that it was tolerated to the self-mord of Carter's message.
"You can be covered, thrown up, shoot yourself with a knife I don't know there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death when he was relaxed with the family.
In a few minutes before the suicide, she wrote, "You must do this, Conrad" and "You just need to include burning, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monnis said that Carter wanted to take care of Roy's death, and prohibited her to communicate with the press so that she would not get what he wanted.
The opinions of lawyers on this conduct were divided.
One of the few protectors of Carter was Amanda Nox, who was condemned in 2007 for murder in Italy in his britain neighbor in the apartment and justified two years later.
The 30-year-old Nox op held its opinion in Los Angeles Times, "Missel Carter deserves sympathy and assistance, not aid."

Audi must modify up to 850 000 dize cars
In the day before the Audi statement by the BMW statement, it was said that it would be proposed to renew software in more than 350 000 cars.
The Chairman of the BMW stated that the company believes that “the ways are more intellectual than the leadership”, including München, where the BMW is available, which have considered the possibility of prohibition or use of design cars.
The Dayler stated on Thursday that it modified three million cars by Mersedes in order to reduce their diseal exhausts.
No one of the company called his step to react.
Car manufacturers have actively continued the use of design cars in the United States and in order to promote the compliance with gas emission rules.
But asylum acids, which produce disorders, are considered cancerogens and can cause astma.
The cost of auto-producers to install an equipment that neutralizes gases with dize cars is also increased, and supporting the competitiveness of the car price becomes difficult.
While German car manufacturers are accurately concerned, the Government of the Officer of the Angel Mercel also accused that it attacks the influenced car manufacturers and ignores the signs of the problem.
Companys are trying not to repeat the "Folxvagen" errors which hid the use of "fraud devices" that could be able to carry out the number of gas exhausted during the testing so that it would comply with the rules and have been disconnected under normal management.
In the United States there was a conviction to a number of Volxvagen members, the rest of them are followed by both the Atlantic sides.
Last month, in Germany, the former leader was arrested by the termodynamic as a group of “Audi” engines.
The former manager, Zackeo Jovanni Pamio, is a Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and can be presented before the court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was under the German criminal investigation with the participation of Folkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to establish a system to enable the Emission Rules and extended an investigation which was earlier focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation can create serious problems with Folxvagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of an unproportionally large part of Folxvagen income.
The cafe visitor in Astrahana was paid with false money
It was reported from the bank's bank's discovery in the calculation of funds, from the company's point of suspicious buying with the nominal 5000 rubles.
The investigation conducted in the Centre of Criminality showed that it was a false.
According to the Russian U.V.D. on the Astrahan area, the banknote was paid by one of the visitors of coffee buying a shourm.
It is important to note that the cash was not equipped by the purchasing authenticity equipment.
Currently, the police are established by the participants to manufacture and occurrence of a CB RF subsequent ticket.
Such crimes are charged by loss of freedom for up to 8 years with a trap of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of MVD calls the Astrahanian populations to be excluded when compiling financial operations; it is recommended to establish equipment to verify the authenticity of the financial instruments received.
Astronomers found a "aunt" planet on which even the iron can float
The first studies of the species of the giant ecoplanet named WASP-121b were very surprised by the temperature of the astrophysics, which was able to exhaust iron and other metals.
Specialists noted that water molecules are so disgraced by the light of the star that are providing infrastructure exhaust.
The Habble Telescope has impressed the lighting of water molecules on this gas gigante: this high temperature makes water light in the atmosphere of the planet in the infrastructure area.
WASP-121b is to the so-called "boiling jupitors" gas gigants, the size and mass compared to the largest planet of the Solar System, but descently closer to the parent star.
This year has only 1,3 "ground" day, and its gas covering is nearly 2,500 degrees of Celsius.
The climate change threatens lavande in Provanse.
It became the symbol of Provans and South France, but now there is fear that it threatened its climate change.
Lavanda has grown worse because of a dry time and overcoming insect diseases; it has become a constant pain of scientists and farmers who are trying to find decisions.
Eric Shes, an expert in Provanse of the Agricultural Research Institute of CRIEPPAM, says: "The Lavanda in Provanse is actually threatened, because in the past years, the impact of climate change has been much less: the weight and especially rain has become much less.
This affects the time of life of the lavanda.
And there are still small cicades that stick on insect papers that transfer micro-bacteria; they become very much in a very dry time."
It's very much on the map.
Lavanda is not only attractive to travellers; the lavand oil is very stressed in parfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says: "Instead of a very long number of colors, we have small, unsuccessful, weakened or missing.
So we have less parts containing epher oil."
The solutions currently discussed include improved water distribution and slowness of landscape, as well as the cleaning of the protective mixture of glass and water and the extract of more sustainable to dry.

The comment of the words of Medvedeva in Gosdepe
The Official Representative of the United States Department, Heather Nawert, commenting on Britain the word of Prime Minister RF Dmitria Medvedev, stated that it was necessary to find " interaction authority" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found to "build bilateral interaction".
As an example of such successful cooperation, Naurth called a Syrian agreement on reconciliation.
We're two nuclear surfaces.
"And people around the world are that the United States and Russia should be able to work together," said the diplomate.
In this context, Naurth has been commented on Medvedov ' s full-valued trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said this, she has certainly the right to speak, but I can't say anything more on this subject," said the representative of Mrs.
The former President of the United States, Donald Tromp, signed a draft law on the execution of sanctions against the Russian Federation.
In commenting on the new package of sanctions, the Government head of the RF Medvedev stated that Washington had announced Moscow a full-valued trade war by ending the hope of improvement of bilaterals.
Medidved also stated that the United States sanctions would be held for decades.
Furthermore, the Prime Minister considers that the United States "smoking "Trumpa" is a "smoking".
The missing bodibilder in the submoscow Bodibilder found the lost memory
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov falls on the road to Noginsk on July 25, in all the spectacular circumstances: he went out of the car salon to go to the toilet.
Seven days, he was unable to find known and acquainted inhabitants.
And Shamiel was on the worm of Ramenski.
He's been fully naked in his wagon.
The Dagestan sportsman couldn't explain what happened here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, but the passport was lost.
In order to establish the personality, the announcement of his promotion has been helped.
It reports that those who arrived by the call of the medical deficiency in Hanmet's part of memory loss and brain trauma, the Mash magazine.
The sports are probably waiting for other surprises.
The criminals who caught Shamila have probably already been in his apartment, and the keys from which he has been stolen.
Petroleum income in July exceeded 7.4 billion rubles
Really received oil income on July 2017 exceeded 7.4 billion rubs, reported by the Ministry of Finance RF.
The overthrow, as the knowledge explains, was primarily accounted for a higher US dollar exchange rate in comparison to the average monthly value of June, as well as for the extent of gas acquisition and exports of oil-products for the predicted levels.
"Revokation of the federal budget of petroleum from the monthly budget corresponding to the Federal Financial Law for 2017-2019, in August 2017, is prognozed at +40.2 billion rubs.", states Minfin's communication.
The total amount of funds for the purchase of foreign currency on the internal currency market for the period from 7 August to 6 September 2017 is therefore 47.6 billion rubs.
As a consequently, the daily buying of the foreign currency is 2.07 billion rubs.
The Bank of Russia will be attracted to the end of the operations of purchasing the foreign currency of Minfin Russia.
Each slave day during the specified period, the BC will conclude transactions for the purchase of foreign currency on the organized markets of the Moscow Bird in a similar manner during the trade day.
The acquired foreign currency will be calculated at the Court of Justice of Central Bank.
The homicide of the journalist stresses that in Me’ca, it becomes more dangerous.
The wedding newspaper Riodos is usually meeting in the midst to discuss plans on the last crimes in the State of Sinaloa with organized crime, corrupted factors or continuing to war drugs.
But today they have been met to talk about security, pressed by their own tragedy.
They said that they had to change their habits.
Two elderly journalists discussed that it was more safer: taking children with them to the office in which they had left the granate in 2009 or leave them home.
Safety experts wrote on the table above, three words: enemies, neutral people, aliens.
They requested journalists to call names for each person - the evidence of the performance is not necessary, suspects and internal feelings will be sufficient.
These are drug trademakers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspicioned that they are in the Government or in the carriers, the entire list of undertakings, which make the work on the chaos in Me’ka becomes dangerous.
Violence does not give advantages, and among the bodies that are in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 times as President Enriko Pena Newet took his post in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are subject to federal protection; and at least seven people died in seven States in this year.
Among the latest is their publisher and inspirer, the foundation of "Riodos" Havier Waldes Cardenas.
"The very great error is to live in Me'ka and to be a journalist," wrote Waldes in one of his many books on drug crimes.
His absence feels very harsh, although his presence totally is the large graph of Valdes, the medium-finger, with the title "Reality" in the "Riodos" statement; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, are wearing footballs on which his smiley, face in the eyes or his company.
The seminar spent less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general trauma, their cosmars, their unson, their paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 until only two cases were investigated, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Like most of the killings committed each year by thousands of drug trafficking and organized crimes, journalists are rarely presented before the court.
The journalists Riodos suggest that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by a bitter, even though they are far more dangerous about now.
Without information about murderers, without justice on security at meetings, Ibarra says.
"Very stupid to lose time on this seminar," he says.
"When we don't know why, we're all suspecting."
On Wednesday 15 May, Waldes went out of the Office of Riodos in Culiacan's capital.
He was able to move only a couple of quarters before his Red Tioto King stopped two men; he was dropped out of the car and shot 12 times likely because of the name of the newspaper, which means "the Twelveth River".
The shooter went on his car and struck her near.
Waldes was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two adult children.
They usually spread quickly from Kuliakan.
But about Waldes, they're almost all silent.
Sinhala, since Gusman was arrested and issued in the United States in January last year, is one of the most bloody fields of battle in the country, since contrary fractions are fighting for filling the vaccine.
We will not say that every day in Sinaloa, one or several persons kill, or that the bathroom is filled with two-catched drug-coroners, which are more than many living people's homes.
We will forget for a minute that with the "requirement" is just when one of the carriers is controlled by a maritime state with important ports and routes of drug traffic in the United States.
Despite this, and the fact that Valdes knew about the dangers of his work, Ismael Bohorkes, 60-year-old Soons and the Director of Riodos, was disappointed by the feeling of the fault that he could not protect a friend.
He thinks murder helped two mistakes.
First, in February, interviewed with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the opposing card fractions that war against Gusman's sons.
The P could disappoint the sons; people who were expected to be the members of the band were purchased all the exhibitions of the issue as soon as they were delivered into kiosk.
The second error was that he was not for Waldes for his own security to leave the country after the other newspaper was disturbed, which wrote about the same story.
Waldes was an endeavor in Mea'ka and outside the border, and his murder was considered as a straight-term in the development of violence against journalists in Me'ka.
He left the danger so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste and in 2003 with five colleagues founded the Riodos, sold his 50 dollars.
In Sinaloa, "not was to be a journalist without a drug topic," said Bohorkes.
In time, the newspaper deserved courageous and honest issues, sales and advertising income.
The journalists liked that they could pick up courageous reports without fear of censures, and the readers attracted that in this publication they could read about what no one had been inclined to write.
Eight years after her "Riodos" received a prestigious premium of Mary Murs Cabo for the reporter in Latin America.
In that same year, Waldes won the International Price of Freedom of Press for Reconciliation in the investigation of drug trafficking, wherever it would be.
He clearly recognized what he had.
"I want to live further," he said on the CPJ premium.
The drug trafficker in Sinaloa, "This is the way of life," he said in October of the past year at the interview of Romepewiento TV.
"You must take a job that lies on you as a journalist, or you're just doing a fool."
I don't want to ask me, "What did you do when it was so much around... why didn't you say what's going on?"
The Riodos' co-operators' shot on Waldes, a boyfriend who was stuck like a lobby in the port, a second, a generous to the volume and advice, a teacher who knew how to be alive.
They trusted in their order.
He should've always weared his head.
He had to go to "El Guaibo", bar against the office, and always sit there at the same chair.
Now they ask, "Have he lost love for the one that has been given?
His death is due to their accounts and doubts about how to make it better and remain alive.
"They don't like when you understand their wives, women, their bicycle, and the underground aircraft for drug transport.
"These things were shit," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in the best time, was a high level of self-evaluation and self-reserving.
I have to believe my instincts.
Keep away from what's wrong.
The problem, says the editor of the Riodos, Andres Wilhareal, is that "a disappointment can be deceived... and then happens what happened to Havier."
The old rules, he and others, are no longer in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulis, Veracus, Guerrero and other States, where there is a genuine mixture of coming contraband paths, public institutions and corrupt factors.
Landshaft's always changed.
In the committee where the Riodoses were gathered for security training, it was suddenly prohibited to offer a new phone: a few days before it was made possible that spion programmes sold exclusively to governments were used in Me ́ca to follow journalists and public activists.
Outside two police are covered in a tree shadow of 104 degrees (40 degrees per Celsius).
The Government has given them the protection of the Office of Riodos, which is in four-year terms in the Burgus Quartal of Kuliakan.
The journalists asked whether these police are not in those 50 per cent of the officers of the Governor who said that they would trust.
A few months ago, journalists moved to a defactory that is under the control of drug traffickers.
The next number of the Riodos was calculated on three main topics.
It's a murder in the Sinaloa brother of the former campion at the box of Julio Sezar Chavez.
They also had a distortion of government expenditure concluded in the town of the Governor's family.
There was a group of people in one of the most dear restaurants of Kuliakan, a quarter from the office of the prosecutor.
It was not officially announced who was deceived or how it had happened, therefore it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write about the fact that all in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant of drugs and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered on behalf of the policy of the Governing Institution-Revolution Party (PRI), which is a dominant at all levels of authorities in the past century.
Recently, a number of Governors from the Pri have been charged with sound accusations in corruption.
William requested journalists to write about the previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo Gusman was awake from military capture.
A few months ago, the readers would seek Valdes with the most reliable inhibitation of defense.
"We would already know what happened," says the 46-year-old William, for its artificial relief called El Flaco.
"All channels of connection with our sources are destroyed."
Valdess' cabinet is now used as a set of places and stackers with protests against the murder of journalists, since they became those who never thought to be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramires took several places and went to the demonstrator on the morning at a prosecutor dedicated to the other journalist.
El Salvador Adame has fallen in Michoacan state on the west of the country in three days after the murder of Valdes.
They found the burned body, and the authorities declared that it was on the tests of DNA.
In the whole country, journalists began to speak awhile, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the trailers and walls of houses.
That day, Bohorkes was a director in Washington, seeking international support in need of justice in Waldes.
At the meeting with the Governor of Sinalo on the day after the murder of Valdes Ramires, the authorities accused that they were spying the journalists and ordering them to kill because they said the truth.
She then asked her not to give her any more tasks on the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger on its objectivity would take place.
Waldes said many times that journalists in Me'ca were " circumcised" by a organized crime, its partners in the Government and the unusual society.
In his last book of Narco-Journalists, he wrote that reporters kill not only drug trafficker banks; they do this by orders of policy and security services in connection with organized crime.
The Committee on the Protection of the Press " Artikulo 19" believes that half of the attacks on journalists in the past year had been concluded by the police and government officers.
"In Me you're dead because they want you to shut up," says Ramires.
Of course, murder fears people.
Everyone remembers the loss of the blogger Mary Elizabeth Massias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found a note written by the Zetas card: "I'm here because of my articles."
Computer keyboard and ears were located near its rejected keyboard.
The issues were preferred to conclude how El Norte was killed in the north border state of Chihuahua after her correspondant Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to be like "El Manyan" from Nuevo Laredo after her murderer in 2004.
In 2010, Diaryo de Suid Huares publicly contacted drug cards with the first editing article on the page "What do you want from us?"
The journalists have abandoned their country or country.
It's a torture decision.
It is difficult to find out the exile, and they are still in danger of the injury.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently occurred with the graph of Ruben Espinose, who was killed in 2015 with four women in the apartment in Me, nearly three months after the fleeting from Verakrus.
Those who remain and continue to work each day are balanced between risked decisions.
Ibarra, who had ever tried to be a poet, admits that he had to write about drug trafficking.
"I'm crazy in hell, and that's why I am a journalist," he says.
Last Wednesday, at midnight, when the last exhibition was already ready for printing, Riodos' publishers sat on the Trotuaire near the office and drinked a beer when their phones were called at the same time.
The series of shots between the opposing bands and security forces near the curriculum city of Massatlan left, according to the data, 19 bodys.
The war continued to breathe as it was promised in a series of letters found in this area.
When they were sitting on the trailer, they made news on the Riodos website.
The first page had to be transformed on the day.
Nearby, the syreans were shooting - another shot in the surroundings.
Bohorkes looked ready for the defence of their police.
If they were afraid, they did not show it anyway.
Sitting under the great portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose medium-finger was exposed to all Sinaloa, the Society of Riodos continued his case.
"How can you think of closing," said Bohorkes, "if the day Havier was killed, the office asked me to send her to the street to report?"
Dinozaver was a camel to avoid enemies
First of all, he is a statue, although it is a terror.
The researchers reported that the first found residues of an incredible ≥ size found by the Canadian chief were so well maintained that experts called " My Lisa among the dinosaures".
It was so well-reserved that they even could determine that the color of his cheese skin was red-corn and said that he had, in some kinds, “the dark past”.
The report described in the magazine modern biography has been described as “the same well-reserved from Tyreofor for the whole history of invents and one of the best dinosauro exemplars in the world”.
This is a recently found emission of nodozawa in the middle of the milk period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His undeserved kindness with the investigators who call him "really wonderful".
This grass of the tireofor is the most well-reserved type of such kind for the whole history of findings, in articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Shaun Fancom when he worked at the Sancor Millennium Shach near Fort' Murray in North Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He went on something that seemed different from the environmental nature, and decided to look out more.
It was discovered to the Royal Tirrelov Paleontologic Museum.
The next six years were conducted to detect animals inside the ground deep mass of 2500 feet (1100 kg).
Now when all this hard work is done, the final result can be demonstrated.
“It is only easy to complain, and it can be almost believed that he is sleeping”, said the leading author Caleb Brown, the Scientist of the King Tirrelal Paleontolog of the Museum in which the creation is demonstrated.
“He is going into science history as one of the most beautiful and well-containing of the dinosaures of Mona Lisa among dinosaures.”
By studying his skin, researchers discovered that it was the grass, despite the covering of it, and reminded of a walking tank, apparently, that it was a significant danger from the flesh of dinosaures.
This covered dynamic puzzle has exposed a red and white cambodge to be taken from the chickens, and has applied a protective technology as a protective box, which also is used by many animals today.
This would allow him to go quickly with the environmental situation and go to meetings with agama, saying experts, assuming that he had greater dynamics on him.
This was age of 110 million years relating to the family of nodosaurus, a wide range of prints in May, and it is now on exhibition in the King Tyrelov Paleontolog Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and gave him the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in the Music Lab Mark Mitchell, one of the participants of the group who had spent more than 7000 hours for his relative discovery.
The spectacular preservation of the exemplary has allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international group of researchers to document the picture and form of cheese and pancirplasms on his body.
They discovered a protective box, distributed protection method in the kingdom of animals, which means that .a was darker than the bottom of it.
Although protective and well-displayed, opening has become unexpected because the size of Borealopelta dinosaura is significantly higher than the size of current animals with protective coast.
It may be suggested that this dinosaura had been so active on the body of dinosaures that evolution had preferred to mask the concentration as a way of survival.
But most of modern animals with protective coasts, such as oleans, zebras or browns, are significantly smaller and I are more accessible, which testifies that nodosamor had to be serious for survival.
“A serious threat from the shipmen for a massive, covered dynamic panzer shows how dangerous the deep dinosaures of the Mel period were,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic units in the cheese dinosaura also shows that its skin should be red-coric.
Scientists continue to study animals, seeking information about his life, including the contents of his food tract, to find out that he eats during his last table.
They believe that when the dinozaver died, he fell into the river and was brought into the sea, where he was thrown down and thrown down on the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Albert was so heavy as now in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans, most likely, spread a lot more dry than now.
“This nodozavir is really noticed that it is fully covered by the cheese skin, and at the same time he was fully kept in three dimensions, keeping the original animal form,” said Brown.
“The results of the animals now look almost the same as seemed at the time, during the rain's middle period.
It is not particularly necessary to reach the imagination to rebuild it, but it is easy to come and you can almost believe that it is sleeping."
The period of mel is the time when giant teropaths, the body's dynosaurus stood on two feet were shiped on the Earth.
Although the most wonderful of them, the tiranosaurus rex, lived for millions of years later than Borealopelta, some of his horrible forefathers could be held on the tireophore.
Their number includes acrocantosaurus, a monster of 38 metres long (11,5 meters) weight of six tonnes.
Scientists whose recent openings are being opened in the magazine " Modern Biology" believe that Borealopelta has been introduced into the sea after death and mumitics have been in the ocean.
It was found by Shawn Fancom when he worked at the Millennium Shach near Fort' Murray in North Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to Museum's reports, it is the best tireophor in the world, together with the skin and the panzer, and it is, from the mourdy to the bulleted bones.
In the average, they reached approximately 18 meters (5 meters) in length and weighted up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Their characteristics were two twenty-five ships from the front.
Researchers believe that this grass of tireofor was hardly dealing with Canada now, until the river's flowing river brought it into the open sea.
However, the underwater conservation of the dinosaura has kept its pencil with precision to the smallest details.
The stone remains of this specific exhibition have been so well maintained that the skin remains cover Bulgarian pancillas under the thickness of the dinosauro.
As Michael Greschko wrote in the article of the National Geographic magazine, this is the degree of the "search as you win in the lottery".
As longer I look at him, more vulnerable he is.
The stone residue of skin until this powder cover Bulgarian pancillas, which cover the beast of the animal.
His right front feet you're thrown down the side, five fingers thrown up on it.
I can calculate the shoes on it."
Michail Saa'vili was able to enter Poland without documents
Michael Saa, who was previously captured by Greece, and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, went to Poland.
He did this without documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
Saavīli reports a Polandian from the Televisija Republic, which placed a video on its channel at YouTube.
Saa-Vilili had been committed to the anniversary of the Barshaw Resurrection against the Hitler Army in 1944.
Since political does not know the Poland, although he tried to start things in this language, he had to speak English through the Polish Translator.
During its political discussion, Greece's cooperation with Poland was addressed as well as related to Ukraine.
The fact that Ukraine ' s migration service had lost its citizenship, the general policy was recognized in the United States.
Exactly how he could make a transatlantic flight without documents until it was done.
The former Governor of the Woods area of Michail Saa said that his signature on an annex to obtain Ukraine ' s citizenship was subjected.
The politician underlined that he didn't fill any anchets.
Duration of the follow-up of the case of Vinciher and Olhovica until January
The period for the preliminary follow-up of the Renova group of Alhohovic and the Energy Chapter of " T Plus" Boris Wainzicher was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court addresses the prolongation of the charged home arrest.
The representative of the CC at the meeting reported that the last time was determined to extend the period of preliminary investigation.
"Personal complexity and duration of the investigation has been determined by the need for exemption and expertise of a large number of documents, as well as conduct of investigations on the territory of several RF subjects," stated the followers.
He added that the suspicioned rules had been taken by the Commissary Guidelines.
Their total size is estimated at least by a billion rubels.
According to this investigation, Weinzicher, Olhovick and the former FAO "Come the Energy Systems" Michail Slobodin, who had designated the "Wimpelk" company until 5 September, had transferred to the Commission the highest office for the establishment of the maximum advantages for heating and electricity tariffs and for the creation of favourable businesses.
Winzicher and Olhovic were arrested, staged in Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, and the release was hidden from the investigation and was announced in a federal investigation.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question “Who are the streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply deep.
Only day after arrival to New York, the tourist was sitting on the bed of St. Louis in the apartment arranged through Airbnb, watching the Facebook feet on the phone.
She pulled somebody from the high school on the post.
There was said, "The police have just killed a eighteen-year-old child, and he is still in the midst of the street."
Taking note of that no one of her bands had paused this information anymore, she closed the Facebook and opened the Twitter.
There was a lot of users in her chain with no one @TheePharoah.
Reper from the Great Saint-Luis in real-time lighted in your death Michael Brown, a safe black-eighteen-year-old, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri State.
He repeated the graph of the unleavened body of Brown, spread between the street, where it will be four hours.
"This is the wildness," she thought.
But death wasn't new for her and her circle.
She gave her the phone, and later evening she returned to the twitter about that people were gathering to Canfield Drive.
There were signatures of the signal chain and crying people and a man who claimed that he was the father of Brown, who was crying, saying, "The policeman from Ferguson just killed my son!"
She looks at the preliminary translation, as the police officer stands before a group of protesting with a dog.
On another video, another policeman, it's a race, he pulled up a bullet and said, "I will kill you all... animals."
“This is a non-standard situation”, according to its own memories, said Ferrell.
"This is not a murder like those to whom we used and which we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a famous.
"I was deceived and wept."
She took a ticket on the back flight and went home for a day.
At 11th evening, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson on the morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in nearly three years has been the theme of the new "Who are the streets?" documentary film, which will end on screen 11 August.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and sustainability from the view of people in the community and full of the streets, required of answers.
Until Ferrell went to Ferguson with a daughter clothed in a blow and a blow in a blow, they remembered the number of times before this morning, "the black and their position."
And she recalls how she said: 'Remember how I told you how the black people were to do for what they believed.'
We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't take her," said Ferrell later.
"What happens today is the colmination of what happened before.
She must know about it, see it and learn it.
It should not only be a good consideration of activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of the experience of black and their positions and what we should do to be free to be free.
Even if I can provide her environment where she doesn't personally match a clear racism, she doesn't differ from any other black girl.
I feel that it would have been a bad favor for her if she had dismissed her."
When they arrived to Ferguson, they made the first remnant in Saut Florisant-Roud, in the area that was divorced by the police party that had made something like a palace camp while the activists waited for reports on the outcome of officer Darren Wilson's injury
There, Ferrell and her daughter attended the company who had prepared the packaging packages.
They gathered packets and helped to distribute them to protest.
In fact, Ferrell has made a new type of activism a shape.
“My activism has been completely changed after 9 August,” she noted that as a student of the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was the President of the Association of Health Students, representatives of national minorities, and was committed to a sustainable justice and inequality in the field of health among black communities.
"I haven't experienced an organizer.
This is the only thing that comes."
For a few weeks at the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folayan, one of his co-registers.
Folayan said that she and her main operator Lucas Alvarado-Ferre would simply "document" events.
Ferrell questioned: "Do you want to document or try to find a story on which you can play?"
This skepticism was designed to many, often white people who came to the community with a view to the benefit of his pain and sustainability.
“We have heard that the votes of people who were born and growing in Ferjuson are not in the center of attention, and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan has already been joined with his co-register Damon Davis, an artist, his activism on the matters convicted to the penalty.
His participation was a sympathy to the project in Ferrell and six still residents with whom the Team of the “Who are the streets?” supported the relations of the Brown's murder during the years.
"In this documentary movie nobody speaks about us or us, it's what we're talking," said Davis.
"This was the most important thing for me as these people will be presented, because it is how I will present myself."
Although the project was not to focus on Ferrell's cup, it was to show that the movement is "not about the leader of the salvator, but about how the community is engaged", as Folayan said, it was about the most open of the film participants.
The result of the “Who's Streets?” shows unexpectedly similar and the life of Ferrell, for example, how she was in love and closed with her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, with a smile about the first time she saw the prepared product.
"But I realized that when you do this, and you do the black, there should be a level of vulnerableness."
Moreover, the history of Ferrell discusses and focuses on the role of black homosexual women in a broader context of the movement “The life of black people is important”.
Two of the three movement founders are those who have created the #BlackLivesMatter tag in the networks after the killing of a black adult Trayvon Mar in 2012 - count to homosexuals.
"The black homosexuality of women in the rues supports all this movement," says Ferrell. "It's because we're always fighting at several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to take all these burdens."
Folayan agreed with this with the note that “the movement is actually supported by black women and homosexual black women”.
However, it states that “This is not a case of discrimination” and that Ferrell was not chosen by a central person because of its different characteristics.
"He was the one who was awakening this energy," she said.
“ On the other hand, it is not a coincidence that it is about in the first place, because when ”
It may feel its energy through the screen."
However, there is no longer a film camera in Ferguson, but there are complicated racial relations between the community and the half.
Ferrell will be two and a half years further at a testing time for the exhaustion of the sex during the demonstration.
It describes the political atmosphere of the place called "Bardack".
She's still holding for a girl who's learned when she went out to Ferguson's street for three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our weapons."
Two Salvador footballers discovalified for the gay of the American players
The footballists of the assembly of Salvador Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received the deal for unportive behavior.
During the quarter-final catch of the Golden Cube of the North and Central America Football Confederations and the Caribbean Base (CONCACAF) the Salvadors have been baptized by American players.
First of all, Henry Romero's protector was defeated.
The Salvador kissed Josie Altidor's attacker, and then stuck him for his shoulder.
Afterwards, half-protector Seren, when the cool was delivered in his straff area, was covered by the United States Protector of Omar Gonsales.
As a result, Romero was disqualified on three shoes, and Seren was six.
The meeting has been completed by the winning of the Americans with the number 2:0 of Goal.com.
Equality exhibition: Artist creates portrets using the DNA Chalsy Mening
In the center of the hall in the Gallery Friedman in New York, with the stream of the wind of the wheat, people are white, black and wheat, all things are incrediblely similar to each other.
These 30 portrets were created by the artist Heather Duy-Harbourg from the bottles of the wheat and the walls sent by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent a sum of Fort Levenworth, where the former investigation analysis deduces a 35-year-old time for the transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition of August 2 is called "Equality Reduction".
This is the result of a two-year transscription between Duy Harbourg, whose experience is combining technology, insight and experience, and Maning, a woman-transexual and a famous dissident, which Barak Obama had sentenced only three days before his presidency.
Analysing the computer DNA program received from Maning and encouraging it to create three-dimensional portrets of persons who could have such a gene, Dui-Harbourg created a depth, even though it was not easy to learn a manufacturer, dedicated not only to the DNA data plastic, by different ways of their interpretation and engineering determinism of these interpretations, but also to understand identity.
Maning, born by Bradley Edward, but from adult age, openly said that it was considered a woman in 2013, it was condemned for 20 episodes, including six violations of the Spionage Act, Computer Feeding and Worm.
Its graphs were not available, so it was only one of its graphs: the black and white sellers in which Manning was in a park-speak, obviously feeling inappropriate, sitting behind the car roll; with this graphy and joining it.
In 2015, Dui Harbourg completed its 2012 "Visions of strangers".
In it, the artist created portrets of non-persons with the judicial evidence of the type of cork and the rainbow, electing out of this DNA muscle and creating images of how these people could look.
And then she received a letter from Paper Magazine.
"They took an interview at Chelsea Manning and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Duy Haggbourg on a preliminary show of a new press exhibition.
At that time, Chelsea was visiting and graphing, so they connected with her and asked if she wouldn't have a portrait created from her DNA.
In such a way, the artist and the Museum sitting in the museum became friends of rescription and exchanged several writings for two years.
They even wrote the book of the Comics of the Depressed Images, illustrated by the Shale of Canungo, which illustrated how the president will be able to punish Chelsea in the future and that will be able to visit the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning in only a few days after the outcome of the book was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in the military campaign in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is opened right now when Donald Trump announces the war of people who reveal secret information in the Government and gets new ways to burn in your enemy that he calls for to meet.
When Duy-Harbourg asked about the coincidence of this all for a time, she said, "nothing is happening."
In the statement of an artist written on the wall of the gallery, a huge signature of Manning below (with a heartfelt point above "i" in its family) calls to end "auto-division based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the opposite side, its mitohondriaal DNA, a long rubber of the C, G and A stated candish.
Including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as scientistly expressed by the artist), Dui-Harbourg hoped to show how we all were amazingly like, in any case by its biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our gene does not determine how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subject it is," said Duy Harbourg; its video in 2007, "Light memories" is also presented here.
"Data DNAs can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories here."
After the part of the exhibition placed in one camel, it is the higher range in comics.
Maning in the style of King Kong appears over the United States Rights Casarm with a voice speaker.
"If they kill your word, they will win," it is written there.
"It's why you never do it."
"This is the primary quota of the letter she wrote to me," says the artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I still have a skin wheat when I'm talking about it."
Menning has not yet seen a personal exhibition - as it was prospectively pictured in comics, but when she is at the comma, she will welcome her masks in the center of the comma, her own genetic simulations, which have been gathered, like a lot of protestants.
It is also done, like all in the exhibition to the height (5"2, Manning growth), which has been drawn by the quarantash of genetic gaplogrups.
"I'd raise them on the walls earlier, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," says Duy Harbourg about portrets.
"I wanted them to be like a massive movement that was made around Chelsea, like a move that was standing behind her freedom."
Professor of the North-West University and the University of Oxford are looking for the police in charge of murder
According to the police report, the national occupation comes to the Professor of the North-West University and to the University of Oxford, which are discovered as suspicious about the fact that in Chicago ' s race number was found killed for a person.

With this question, Mutko said, "We are investigating because our antidopine system has failed.
All measures were taken.
But there were no hosts, and we will not admit what was not."

WADA removed RUSAD from the implementation of the pending control in November 2015 after the pending scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the monitoring of experts and the British Antidopine Agency (UKAD).

Holdenberg recognized the distortion between NATO and Russia
On Wednesday, 4 August, the Office of Radio 4 reported the newspapers with an outstanding MMI.
According to his statement, the Russian authorities are responsible for the distortion between Western and Russia.
In the CNN, the NATO genetic interview also criticized Russia for the situation with Crime and "destabilization" on the East of Ukraine.
Stolenberg concluded that the dialogue with Russia, however, was strict, and that the further scale of the situation would not benefit from any of its participants.

Starta, which will help your company not become a regular "Uber"
Amy Erre wanted to evaluate the level of satisfaction among its startup in the field of electronic trade, but the investigations did not work.
The answers were often disappointed, deceived, or worse, unexpected.
And even though she promised an anonimity, some did not trust that process.
“He has never been successful and objective”, the race of Erre, which has been managed by the company of San Francisco of 75 Madison Reed in the field of electronic trading on hair trading.
Therefore, she turned to the third party for help.
There is now a new type of startups in the field of work with staff that helps companies to find out how their feelings are.
By developing and licensing a programme-security designed to be measured in the efficiency, they allow companies to make extracts, to address certain teams and demographic groups, to be anonymous and heat line for complaints, and, in some cases, to allow inhibitors to pass the top management and directly to the direction.
"Now we have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, the Soons and the President of the Glint start of Redwood City, whose analytical programmes are used for the measurement of the company.
Erre's race that has reached more understanding than they think and feel in three years of Glint ' s use.
Additionally, the product provides a heat card of the company and shows in a supervisory form of greater complaints and the low approved assessment of the company.
Companys are at least aware that they need to control the situation of the slave, elsewhere they will become a regular ‘Uber’, which has been interrupted in the scandal when the former post was repeated in the blog described in which the aggressive situation was ordered by those who expressed deficiency.
For startups such as Glint, this is the desire to control the situation is the opportunity for a successful business.
According to the Internet port, “Let us talk about payment”, dedicated financial technologies, global management, regulation and compatibility industry may cost more than 118,7 billion dollars until 2020.
The Convercent start of Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and discover bad behaviour, noted a small growth of interest and activity in the Ubera reputation background this year before.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
The Uber has recently occurred among the clients.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send a personal opinion on individual order, to collect confidence and responses in real time and to review the heavy cards of problems areas.
It also provides a warm line for anonymous text communications that allows them to report bad behavior.
And if a top manager gets thrown, the complaints go directly to the direction.
“The Court of Public opinion has overcome the authority of the in­towers”, said Patrick Queenlan, the foundation and the President of the Company Convercent.
If it is clear that the company is wrongly treated with or acts inevitably, even if the inhibitor is not limited, the company may face the precious consequences in the form of clients, the rate of the bills and the courts, Kwinlan reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants, where more than 25,000 inhibitors worked in 500, was the Convercent over a year to make sure that they were in the course of rules and procedures, and to offer a simple way to visit the company's office.
Previously, if he wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for the phone number or email of the office, to give an official complaint and to hope that it would be serious.
It was often a horrible and anxious experience, reported James Vitrano, the director of Ruby Tuesday's company's officer, who said that it was not a normal way to follow complaints.
Now when the company uses the Convercent service, the problems that have been hidden before from the office managers in other cities or states, such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages of work, can be soon discovered and occupied.
“I can draw close to the complete, comprehensive understanding of the situation”, said Vitrano, who will rush the network risk management group Ruby Tuesday.
“And we protect our shareholders from judicial proceedings.”
According to Quenland, the companies began to be more serious to the ethics, values and innovations in 2002, after the Arthur Andersen' accounting company had suffered from ethical distortions resulting from "D" Enron.
But only when “the networks have received mass distribution”, companies realized that they were not able to keep their severe protein from the virus distribution on the network.
He said, "Before starting using technology to control ethical people ispo" hope," he said.
And Glint, and Convercent have their programming as a service, taking from the companies a rule to use their products.
This is the business model and the possibility of approving the venture investors supported by both startups.
In February, “Convercent” received a 10 million dollars from the company such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which resulted in the total capital of the company at 47 million dollars.
Glint received 10 million dollars in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, resulting in the total capital of the company with $60 million.
These investments may not be wonderful if they participate in the related nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of studies shows that today's terms are expected of their slaves more than before.
On markets with cruel competition, such as the Silicon valley, high for interested projects, is only a minimum.
Partners want to feel that they accept and appreciate and dedicate their time to the local mission.
“When people are happy to work in the company, they feel that they hear and that their work results, they are more trying to make such a company successful”, says Nina ́kuin, the vice-president for global loans and satisfaction in the LinkedIn company, where they are used, and ‘Convercent’, and ‘Glint’.
Investors receive income when businesses from their portfolio are good; businesses are good when they are loyal and loyal.
If analytical instruments of the third party promise to increase their loyalty and their integrity, it is not surprised that they are supported.
As Cultural Specialists claim in slavery places, it is important to provide data on the performance of the workshops.
But the data are deceived until the winners of the company take action.
In fact, if the company asks for a reverse connection, it may make an impression that changes are increasing.
And if changes do not make enough quickly, or not at all, disappointment may be developed, and the interests will be lost.
"If you are going to ask for 4000 proposals, you must be ready to conduct 4000 talks," says Russell Rat, president for consultation in the Cotter International Management Company, which was supposed to see how companies make a mistake by confiding too much on data collection.
"Why, if you do not come to the end, they will say, "You have heard me the truth?
Didn't you matter?
And if you do nothing, why should I not be able to do anything?"
According to Erre, the Madison Reed company, who now conducts monthly questions, is able to take measures on the same day when someone reports the problem with Glint.
And, after a recurrent connection from the parties, the lack of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to organize several teams in the parts of the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
The Ruby Tuesday company has new knowledge of its own and hopes that these knowledge will help her to maintain more effectively in the growth that is highly current.
"If you are not old to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose your clients, you lose your company.
In Barnaul, a new asfalt on the Red Army
In Barnaul, a cardinal measure was taken to eliminate the cause of the disturbance of the asfalt in the Red Army.
The place where twice the jackets appeared on a recently asfalted part of the street (screening from the Youth Street), it is determined to "hide".
On the other hand, a small part of the road near the travelways had occurred because the land was located in the area of an unexploited network.
According to the Vice-President of the City Committee on Travel, Travel, Transport, and Communications, Ivan Harmata will conduct an investigation in order to investigate and eliminate the prejudices for pollution.
On the basis of its results, measures will be taken.
It is supposed that there is a need for rebuilding and betoning of freedom communications.
This is reported on the official site of the country capital.
The Board of Briance must be further worked because the National Student Association has cancelled training twice a day
The time comes to 11 dinner; a crowd of footballists at the University of California in Los Angeles is detained to speak on one side of the new training fields of the campus team.
There were footballs with their footballs, covering the snakes from the poet after the first pressed day of the camp.
For many players of the team, these minutes are a break in the middle of the day.
The players recorded for the summer jobs, after three hours of training, will be returned to the campaigns to prepare for final tests and will return to the Football Centre of Vasserman at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday became Tuesday, the trainer of the team Bridge Jim Mora said, "These guys are waiting for a meal in three days."
The fact that the National Studential Association canceled training twice a day, which was intended to reduce the charge for players, actually decreased their slave day, at least before the reviews were held on Friday.
Thus, the first three training team of the California University in Los Angeles was appointed at 7:15 a.m. that they would be placed in and without the body of players.
A side effect from the lack of two trainings daily has been more than one train, and Bridge moves the camp almost a weekly compared to the last year and trains during the summer school at the first time in the six seasons of the sea in Vestuda.
According to the schedule, 18 training should be carried out up to 20 August, including before starting the official preparation for the first game at the season against the Teach University of A&M in September.
Mora said that it supported the amendment of the rules by the National Studential Association, despite that it had another item in the player's carrying out.
"In three or four days, we will give them this great burden, this is a serious trial," said Mora.
"And they have only seized him, and they work, and they reveal the men.
I think when we live until the Sabbath and we have more time, it'll really be good."
When the camp ends, the Californian University in Los Angeles will make training closed; this is an unclean task, since its fields are directly visible with the appropriate parking and from the neighborhood Laskin, a dear hotel that has already been bombed with football guns that are overcoming the protective network behind the doors.
Players from Briance must take a hotel starting with these outputs, but Mora admits that when the camels are free during the season, the problem could be.
"We will have security," said More.
"This is a serious problem, and I do not increase the risk, assuming that someone can take a comma, sit there and write a video training.
If you have a film of training, it's very serious.
But we'll have a security there, and we'll have a security at the park number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna be too worried about that.
We have a plan."
All suffering from the terrorism in Petersburg are recorded from hospitals
All those suffering during the terak at the metro of Sankt Peterburg in April were recorded from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the vice-governmental of Anna Mi.
According to the end of July, three people remained in the stationaries, "TV Centre".
On the other hand, the metropolite explosion in Sankt Peterburg progressed on 3 April of the current year.
The bomb was a terrorist, Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the terrorism, 15 people were killed, as well as the artist themselves.
The 11 persons, including the preferred organizer of Abbror Azim, were arrested.
At the same time, Rosebrook Surveillance recommended that Petersburg metropolitan revision plans for transport safety, in particular by increased meta-security frameworks.
Facebook strengthens the fact-cheking in the fight against fair news
Facebook will often send texts, suspicious to mystery, independent experts, and show their conclusions under the original statements, stated the most important world network on Thursday, which is trying to do with the so-called fake news.
In the statement on its website, the company stated that it started using improved machine educational algorithms to recognize the sites, send them to check and may show the results of the cheque facts under the original afternoon.
Facebook was criticised as one of the main ways to spread the so-called fair news, which, according to many, have affected the presidential elections in the United States in 2016.
This issue is also actively debated in the context of the failure of the French electors before the president's elections in May, and in Germany before the elections of September, they claimed to support the plan to browse networks if they would not operatively remove posts of hatred.
On Thursday, Facebook reported in German statement the testing of the new Czech Algorithm, which was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"Besides seeing what messages are accused of independent inspectors, people want to have a widespread context to bring reasonable judgments on what they read and share," wrote the Facebook news feed manager in their blog Sarah Sue.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "related articles" and work on other changes in the news feed to solve the problem of fair news.
Create Roman Comics: One lock in English History
In the past, the lock of Scotty was recorded in the video "Sque," and in the 70s and 80s, he served as a place for Margaret Tetcher.
But 700 years from his holiday place in the valley of Build in Kent's graphy he observed a storm story around, and now he inspired Jamie Rods, the Yorker with a cope and with a decline to historic documents, to Roman Comics.
"I am, it's so beautiful -- looking at a man who died 300 years ago," he's excited.
"You feel that personally when you keep it in your hand."
"Camlock in England" includes a period from the middle century to the Evardian Epoch and relates about the families living in Scotty; each history of the young British artists -- Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Grinberg.
This is not the first book of Rods, which is on the →date: In 2014 he wrote "The Teeth of Dead Man and other stories" - a collector of the materials of the British Library; this project was unexpectedly drawn to the depth of the soul.
"I could just put a fingerprint on the edge of the letter written by a dual agent in 1700," he says.
"This is his fingerprint."
And the letters are always smoking in the smoke because the fire was burned at that time.
And after 300 years, in the future, you know you're there too.
Oh, how I love the archives!"
For a person who is encouraged to old papers, receive support from the National Fund and the English Experience Council and live in the castle for four months ("I've been a little busy there") too good to be true.
Rods studied the "new" victorian lock all days, walked through the archives and examined the numerous treasures of the property and old things - such as the gien on walls or bottles, the centuries of the roof.
He walked through the park and the destructions of the old lock, talked with the forests, gardens, and sometimes with artists who worked on the pictures of his book.
Then the night he was "buying whisky and sat down to write."
The story of Scotney's lock has not been very studied because the National Fund has received full access to it only in 2006 when she died after her inheritance, Elizabeth Hassi.
When Rods came there 10 years later, they just started to discuss the dictionary, which he described as "this that aristocras had fallen down on the knife for centuries".
Journals, a letter of the British Empire's time, cards, which have been owned, "You think that the breakfast is fair," says Rods, but here were two families fighting for this.
That's it, guys."
In some stories, the lock collector becomes a sending point for broader searches in the English history: for example, in the Workshop, the hero is running from the just built lock to join the Christian Revolution in 1381.
"There are information about the rebellion that occurred in 1380, in the book Kenta and Sassex's Ricers family," says Rods.
"The Christian resurrection began in these places, and I thought that the rebellion was the right beginning.
Perhaps they were?"
Other arguments are strong with the lock story, for example, the "History", in which the Jezuites priest whose family Darrel had taken seven years during the English Revolution.
Or "Contrabandist" about the contrabandist of the 18th century, Arthur Darrel, who, as they think, is an inscenary of his own funeral, buying the grave with stones (that was discovered in several years when the grave is outside).
Darreles are the favorite Rods family of all people of Scotty: "The Gentlemen, they were a perfect jealousy, forever entered into and lost money for what they could not allow.
In various generations, the men of Darrela have resolved their problems with women married to rich older women -- I imagine them as a company of sympathetic men who are able to look for the inheritants of great states."
After working in the Rods lock, there will be other opportunities to get a unique writer experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish mouse, where he wrote a graphical novell about Elamenmaka, where he was a sanator at the beginning of the 20th century, and then he grew up again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a place for him.
"I was hard to leave," he says.
"I felt almost like that: shit, I have to go back to real life again."
Fifteen major banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Russian Bank Association (ARB) is developed: after Szerbanc, WTB, ITB-24, Alpha-Banc, Gazproband, Rosselhosbanc, Binbanc and FC " Opening", seven other credit organizations will leave this public organization.
Thus, the shares of ARB organisations will be at least 80 per cent of the market.
But this is not simply the outcome of all banks who claim to interrupt with the ARB, negotiating with another public organization, the joint credit institutions, the Association of the Regional Banks of the Russian Banks, which is addressed by the Anatolia Axakov Policy, the President of the Committee on Financial Market, recognised, at the outcome of the last session and the most effective role of the opinion committee and the Deputy on the number of draft legislative projects.
The start of the conflict within the ARB was held in discussions in the Federation Council when new legislative projects were discussed in the Inter-regional Bank Council, in particular with a new class of banks depending on the amounts of the constitutional capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, said that the Association viewed that this draft law was adopted in the interests of major banks, thus trying to provide the possibilities of small and medium banks in the regions by capturing their customer.
Among other claims, the call and criticism of the Central Bank, which, in view of Tosuanyan, does not always be justified by the revocation of licences in some banks, which, in fact, followed the expression by the representative of the CB: many rue people are sprayed by banks, particularly the external banks, in the rue of the ARB.
See, this exchange of inter alia exceptional opinions with the main bank regulator and with the visible behaviour of the fifteen major banks, when stated that the ARB policy had been noted, began to be prepared to enter into the association with the " Russia", noted that "the effectiveness of the ARB work was at low level and that the active dialogue within the bank community was not actually carried out."
The tabs will be better
What's the matter going on?
Let us answer the main question that arises in a smaller disturbance or conflict in the banking area or near it: It will not threaten the tabs, rather, the confidence of the banking system will increase.
The "Russian" Anatolius Axakov, who is acquired of his accuracy in all the interests of banks and their clients, a high level professional who is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: almost all guidelines of the BC are present to annual association activities, and all significant legal initiatives of the regulator are passed through the "regional" experts.
It is obviously not foreseen in the framework-organization plan.
Without prejudice, the ARB falls into an improper financial and administrative situation after the loss of such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbyst opportunities.
However, in this older institution, in 1991, there is a great potential to continue compliance with the bank legislation and the field of monetary and credit treatment in general.
Without saying that in the Russian Association with spread volumes, they are ready to adopt under any conditions of new members, judged by the reaction of its owner, Anatolia Axakov ("before too much for"), which was still on 21 July in the press report of the Parliament's newspaper, said that "the representatives of the banks from the ARB had requested me to consider the potential of growing in our "Russian Association".
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankiers in the Association Council and to give more attention to new banking technologies.
Now and in the negotiation process, the proposals of both parties are being examined, prepared for an extraordinary association arrangement that was held in Sochi in the middle of September in the international banking forum.
We'll get out there.
Anatolio Axakov also, underlined that "the chair is not held", called the new rue of the updated "Russian" Jorgey Luntov's Association, who left the post of the Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, highly characterising its business and the qualitys.
18 August, Anatolius Axakov, who now rests in Crimea, plans to suspend and come to Moscow on the extraordinary stage of the Association Council of the Russian Association, where it is intended to consider the agenda of an extraordinary emergency of Russia.
Business cars with a gas engine into the major cities of Russia will not be able
The Deputy Manufacturer of Mintrans Nicolai Asaul said that, despite the communications of the MMI, the car cars with a benzine engine to the major cities of Russia would not be able to go.
It's more radical than our concept.
Our concept that the environmental class should be gradually increased.
And there's the concept of going to zero emissions.
I think we're not technically ready for this.
The question is, since what year?
That's the same thing at the level of the louzing phrase-- let's prohibit.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will we close the whole city?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe it's happening," says the Minister's words.
The previous report reported that at 17 August, the vicepremier Arcadia Durkovicchich was ordered to study proposals on the options for electrical transport support, submitted to the Government by the Director of the PAO CamAZ Sergei Cogogin.
Among the proposals, the newspaper information, is the use of DVS cars in major cities and curriculums.
Washington changes the rules of receipt of a greencard.
As reported by the media, President Donald Trump said that a new immigration plan would be adopted to amend the rules for the receipt of a grindcard.
The plan provides to reduce the number of immigrants to 50,000 per year, more strict rules for the receipt of temporarily slaves and for family visa.
The new rules are held by the Republic of the Party and are supported by the President.
The draft legislative will be discussed in two Congress palats.
“This law will decrease poverty, increase the amount and seconomerate the tax payers of a billion dollar, and will make it as a change in the way the United States issues the Greencards to the citizens of other countries.
The law reduces the heat and replaces the current scheme.
The new statement process provides the benefits of the candidates in English, having the financial resources that allow them to contain themselves, and the equipment that will benefit from our economy,” said Trump, the American SME.
Sex works are real, and this must be anxious for us.
We did not think that 2017 could not be worse, but the new report on the technological success in the production of sex workers has been reported.
Yeah.
Sex workers are now in the center of attention.
The Responsible Worker Fund (FRR) has recently issued a report dedicated to the development of sexual workers in nearly 5 to 10 years.
According to Noel Charka, the Professor of Working Technicians and Experience Intelligence of the University of Shephild and FRR, we should be seriously addressed to their appearance.
In the form of robots, the shape of sockets and the type of legs, the color of the robots' eyes.
"The people hide this behaviour, but the companies are already sending them to consumers, and we will soon see them much more," said Charky in the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex-cuck evolution is from their amusement colleagues in robots with silicone skin, heavy to the cup, and with almost the replications of the experienced intellectual.
They can also "made" their robots by their eye, choosing all from the color of the eye and shapes of the robot sockets to the shape and the color of the neck.
But the fact that many robots have "personality" compared to which Stepford Woman would be very progressive, it would be more concerned.
Modern sex bulks have become robots with silicon skin.
For example, RealBotix robots allow users to set up the quality robots they are attracted - for example, stability.
There are other Roxxxy Gold sex workers, once "True Companion", which are set up with already programmed individuality - for example, "The Cold Farra" produces a sustainable impression, and the "Dica Wendy" has a "mood" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that matches yours," the "True Companion" site reports carefully.
Therefore, she loves what you love, does not love what you do not love, and so is it.
It has changed its attitude during the day as the true man!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may be "in a position"!
In the event of sexual workers, there are many concerns - not lastly because they are replaced by real relations, but mostly concerns the subject image of women, the association of violence that causes the cold (read: opposite) Pharaoh.
On the True Companion, Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman has (sic!) may have a vibrator, why can't man have Roxxxy?" says on the site.
But these sex robots are not just fetishis or just new sex games.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicates something more darker and deep in our culture, a decline from the ideal gender-effectiveness towards the desire of sex with an optional additive.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex workers, and although FRR notes their popularity, they remain still in consumer culture.
But what brings to us from the surface may be fully learned about the meaning of the time we live in.
And many people are not stupid or aggressive until the free market will give them the opportunity.
This is not a coincidence - that these complex sex works have occurred exactly when women's rights worldwide were threatened when the president is in the White House, who praises what it adheres to women.
The most important in the teleserial "Speech of the Servant" is not graphical images, broken bodies and exhausted eyes, exactly how visible it is.
The Response of Gilead is an exhaustion, but now it's not so big.
The goal of sexual work industry is to get such a fis of similarity to real women (only with pornostar proportions) that technology allows.
Their creators want people to seem to be stuck to make the cop movement of the body.
But exactly their "characters" robots are not like true women.
They cannot fight with their partners or leave them.
They have no life or biografies -- nothing that could indicate independentity or something else that could distort the illusion of full dependence.
In other words, these are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, the servants.
Los Angeles Eugene (Puh) Jeter, who is a member of the assembly of Ukraine since 2013, does not help our national team at the campaign of the basketball, which is the final part of which starts 31 August.
That's what BeBasket's portal reported by the general manager of the "Blue-grounds" Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to agree with Jeter, but, unfortunately, he would not accept family conditions.
We'll go to a robot without a natural player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will give the opportunity to develop our young players," he said.
At the time of Jeter's immediate participation, the Ukrainian collection took the sixth place for herself on the worksquete-2013 and first came on the basketball campaigns in which the yellow blue was not able to overcome the group's stage, but the U.S. increasing in the middle of the game 15.4 points, made 3 choices and delivered 5 transfers.
Jeter stopped speaking for Ukraine's collection since the staff of the main trainer of our national team of Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
Man's robasquet-2017, at the same time in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will carry out its group tournaments on the Earth.
There will be five individuals: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Greece (3th), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In the framework of the preparation for tournament, our husband collection conducted two control units in which the Netherlands and Belarus were involved.
The big treasure of Trump?
It's myth Romany's totally .
At the time of Trompe, the fact that political disputes made by the American electorate have been destroyed at micro-level.
Among the Thanksgiving and Christmas, the American newspapers have been pearled on how to cope with the horrible families voting for Trompe.
Looks like we're all stressed as soon as we're hitting.
They are less talking about the ability to join the family.
I'm writing about this because my cousin, the left view of the poetes from Chicago, who had been on the swords with the resistance of the elders in his family, came to me this week to New York.
She said to me that the union in the fight against the general agency could have a effect.
At the White House, all who she knows, including the brethren-resp, with which she has discussed the policy for decades, were suddenly and strangely on one side.
Within the dinner, it is certainly good, but I can't think that it may be enough dangerous in a broader context.
Trump inspired forces in the left floor, but the deforming effect of his rulership can move us all right.
When we talk about Trompe and "Normalization", we mean a little likely opportunity that one time we will stop taking his outcome.
There is, however, a more suspicious scenario in which the Trump "normalizes" the most right replies of the people that will unexpectedly be shown in the background of its standards.
I believed that I was very disappointed today by the old-modal shame of Mitt Romney - with a dog on the car's cup and a 14-percent eligible tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looks like) - compared to Trom and that otherwise very small.
When Trump wy, the candidate's response will be sufficiently in mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the Carusel in the Central Park, the biggest carusel of the New York Park Department, and the best way in town to spy three dollars if you don't need coffee.
The bullets are horrible and huge, glass volcano pictures on the central barbain - the flashing clowns and animals, which, as a result, look at their backs, are extremely bad, and the sounding, as weird, leads to an obstacle.
So many things in this town are disappointed: the species of heavenly silver are older, the conviction forces are too deceived to cause trembling, and the reality of the city does not work after the mob.
Thirty-five years past, and I'm still worried on the day when I learned that the Swiss-cottage area is actually not a Swiss-switzerland (the thematic papa "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" not in account), but a big circular cross in North London.
And the carusel in the Central Park is too an unusual, wild place in which two years old children, eleven years of child, and two women in forty can take a good time.
If I could put a carussel, I would put a five, but, for fortunately, no one asked me about it.
And at the university this week, I was asked before I had a terminal card, to evaluate my "experience" purchases from one to five stars.
In the coffee on the angle of my street, the same plus option to make a tea in 15 percent is the order of stomach.
As a result, the neutrality is not only relaxed by the idea of interaction, but it is also necessary to introduce a personal attitude to a situation that does not assume it.
The poor seller at the Universe laughed confusionally while I was able to have my experience to introduce her credit card in five stars.
Oscar Pistorius translated from the hospital because of pain in the breast
Pistorius leaves the guest for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for treatment of inflammations, which, according to the admissible administration, he received in the camera.
Pistorius was convicted for mental murder after the appointment of the prosecutor to the initial sentence for unpredicted murder.
He killed Steencamp the early morning of the Holy Valenny in 2013, shot it a few times through the door of the toilet camel in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius said that he accepted his friend for the night warp he hid in the bathroom.
The prosecutor claimed that it would be another protest, this time against the six-year-old Pretorius, who, according to it, was too slow.
The General Prosecutor stated that the Court of Justice of the South and the Appeal would be considered in this year.
Pretoriaus time may be increased by 15 years if the prosecution is successful.
There is no punition in the South.
A signature on non-exercise is chosen to be suspicioned in the category of the NTV journalist
The officers have chosen a measure of interruption in the form of a signature of non-exemption for men who had attacked the NTV Telecanal Journalist Nikita Disportev during the direct epher from the Hornox Park 2 August.
This reports TASS with the Official Representative of MVD RF Irine Wolk.
"In the investigation of the voting case excited by section 116 UC RF ("Peace") concerning a 32-year-old man who struck a Correspondent of one of the telephones in the Central Cultural Park and the rest of the name of the Horn, which was selected by a suspicioned measure of interruption in the form of a signature of unusualness and adequate behaviour," said Wolk.
The representative of the MVD added that the suspicious is a administrative protocol for police failure.
In midnight, 2 August, during the direct epher to the Day of Responsibles, an unresolute man came to the Correspondent and struck the face.
As shown lately, the huligan has nothing to do with the DCV.
Instead of trying to keep the mosque.
Two Bulgarian citizens were arrested in Greece for the illegal palace
According to the Bi-Ti-Wi telephone, reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were arrested in Greece for an illegal palate station.
On Tuesday, 1 August, a group of people was arrested in Sitonia, set up the tabernacles in unsettled position, including two Bulgarian citizens.

The Greek authorities have undertaken the control of the free campaign and have already been assigned to those who have been captured in a non-destined position.
The tests will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may appoint a straf.
The Russian Mid-Russian Vice-President accused the "Cool War" territory of the United States
The statements made by the United States Vice-President Michael Pens, were subject to the criticism of the Russian IMI.
"Peacefully, it is to be found that Washington is deeper to the primitive idealized stamps of the cold war, which are completely dismissed from reality," says the Russian outerpolitical statement.
Thus, in the Middle, the reply to the Penns on the "Russian threat" and attempts to interrupt the border of the underground.
The Russian MIDI pointed out the importance of " or with Western, or Russia" election and the invisibleness of the person as if the whole South-East entered into the NATO.
The Russian diplomats also claimed that the United States had violated the international law by applying the force to reject Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another stress.
"We invite the American colleagues to stop the sharing of Russia and its outside line, which is increasingly based on respect for partners and the preparation for joint co-activity, in the mutual interests," says the Russian Middle-American statement.

In Odessa, the woman cast her son into the building of her newborn son, putting the whole package.
On the evening of 3 August, the police reported from the resident that he had found a package with a child in an unconstructed private house.
"The rights and doctors who operatively delivered a child to the medical institution were on the place of the event," reported the National Police Chapter of Odessa.
The doctors determined that the boy was born for a few hours before his discovery, which is evident of the presence of the pupil.
In the course of primary operational activities, a 36-year-old inhabitant has been set up the identity of birthday.
It has also been established that the woman has three other young children.
As mentioned in the chapter, the family’s view of the rightguards did not fall before, and the teaching was not at the point.
The police are currently established by the circumstances and reasons that have offered the woman to make this action, after which the processing decision will be taken.
The kid is now under the doctor's surveillance.
As reported earlier, a 21-year-old woman in Nikolaeve had cast her unborn child into the museum.
Gregory Leps: "I'm going to fight, although 55 is not 30."
One of the most successful artists of the Russian Estrade Gregory Leps will release his 55-years on the next Sunday.
Before the complaint, the song communicated with the reporter.
I'm remembering how your "polyline" was noted.
The special tabernacle in the "Lights", Gloria Geinor sang for a denominator, a powerful salot over Moscow River.
You're probably able to get your five-year-old.
Are the plans accomplished?
If you were talking about professionals, it was a successful period.
I worked a lot, three times passed with the guests throughout the country, giving 120-130 concerts per year.
I've released two bad albums.
Of course, now I'm not the one who, we're saying, 20 years ago.
The biological hours are not lying.
The song as I sang in my 30s becomes more difficult.
However, I'm fighting, I don't want to stay.
And I'm with new people, I'm going on a different level.
You're recording the new album with them, the first in three years.
Yeah, work on him now and again.
In fact, we've already recorded all in my study and now we'll send him to Los Angeles.
It is called "Why are you so serious?" in a single song that is written together with You.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't trained her anywhere.
We'll do it later when we'll take the clip on it.
And the album will be held in November to the series of my Jubilee concerts in Moscow Crocus City Holle.
To your new plastic, a classic American cowboyman, Chris Coulman's hand.
You wanted him and your gastrointestinal composite?
I think, Colman is one of the most detailed issues of the world's barbarians today.
He came to my school, recorded his party.
I told him to enter the composition of my group, and Jeremy Colson (a barbarian who was involved in various projects. - "Report").
However, for continuous work in Russia, they were slowly moved too much conditions.
It was about honors from $35,000 to $45,000 per month.
Then I thought that I would find dignified persons in the post-sheet space.
And he found a great little boyfriend.
It is better to feed your own.
Sometimes I want to get to some of them, not for what.
For example, the guitarist Fedor Dosum is highly quoted at international level.
Western magazines are written about it and invited him to different gitarr festivals.
Steve Way, listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came with another executive technology."
Your album is coming to Los Angeles, the Americans are working with you, but you can't still come in the United States?
Are you trying to remove this prohibition?
Now, honestly, I don't do anything.
There are a number of initiatives to address this issue.
As a man, I really am sorry that I can't go to America.
I never said I was learning there.
The more you're communicating with these professionals, the more.
We're not stupid to them, but we have no such experience, schools.
In the past 70 years, before our artists, the Pope was not completely addressed to the tasks that were always decided by the Americans.
They tried to be highly qualified.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, I've got a reason for the United Kingdom to get me in 10 years.
But I'm going to give documents to the British Office every year to allow me to go there again, and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of me will be kind to me.
And in August, you've been planning a concert in Monaco, not a mandate, but an affair, right?
Yeah, there's a good sporting room in Monte Carlo, I've been there once.
Now they have been invited again, and as I think, all the tickets for the concert have already been sold.
To Randeva Lima Waycule, starting on July 20, you're going to go?
She invited me, and I, of course, answered.
La is a wonderful song and a beautiful woman who is able to give herself and herself and herself, and even a shepherd.
After the gastrointestinal and jubilal concerts, as I know, you want to turn to the creation of the High Vladimir.
You already have two albums with his songs in the discography.
When's the third one?
Probably in the year.
But he'll be done otherwise.
I want to write the 80-90 songs of the High to the same date as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
To join me, our Family Timor Wednernik will be.
I'm trying to participate in the album and Alexander, Jacoblevich Rosenba.
I talked to him about this, we've got good, but he's a man busy, so we'll see how it's going to happen.
You and the songs Boris Grabenchikov gradually introduced into your repository.
Maybe then you'll write the album of it?
Boris Borisovich is a man and a wonderful man.
I crossed with him a few times and asked, "Shall I sing the song or any other song?
He said, "Grigor, I write songs that they may be fulfilled."
Please, try, sing.
It's probably interesting to write this album.
Until I have no such task, but in the future, in a year after, if Boris Borisovich is not gonna be insulted, I may have done that project.
If you don't focus completely on your manufacturer centre.
I guess you have signed contracts with all the artists you're interesting?
There's a whole number of artists I'd like to have under my wings, but they're self-like people.
Are you under Sergei Lasarev?
Seresha is a brilliant song, I invited him.
I may not agree with his repository, but he is a professional and has its development.
And now in my center, there's Alexander of the Panayotes I've led to the Voices.
We've concluded the agreement and we're working.
In our pop music, such songs are rare.
It will be sincerely sorry if he doesn't make the heights that he is worth.
I'm trying to get him a repository, I'm moving him.
I hope that it's a good result.
I'm also trying to move other artists of my centre: I buy them songs, weep poets, sometimes their tricks fall in television and radiocanal rotation.
If they do not have great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to the log of the end.
On the output they will receive a recorded album, a few videos.
And then, if they're able to go their way, I'm not going to encourage them to return the money in them.
Although I would be pleased if any of them had a commercial success and would pay me the percentage we had agreed in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, run, prove what I ever proved.
If you'll be proposed to make an Ukrainian gastrointestinal tour tomorrow, and you'll go?
I'm invited to this pool.
In the main way and on the closed activities.
And what's going on with a big tour...
I was a man of my country, a Russian, in my own victory, flying to Syria on the same plane that then was breaking.
If they say tomorrow that you need to fly to any other point in the interest of the State, I'll be quiet.
And I'm worried about what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I am sincerely sorry that we had this situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we are one people and we must be together.
I'm sorry if it's not going to happen at least in the nearest time.
And I've been giving 40-50 concerts in Ukraine for a year.
They meet nowhere.
Thank you very much.
And with several Ukrainian artists, Annie Lorak, Saint Lobodo, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, the mass of gifted people, and sincerely, they can't be able to completely give you their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music must be united and distracted.
I would be pleased to invite a classic Ukrainian artist to Russia, such as Slava Vakarchuk, and make a concert with him.
But I think it's not likely...
Andrea Ohlopkow was throwed out with space
As " E", the East Andrew Ohlopkov Technical Director of the Cosmodrome approached the State Space with the Scientific and Production Centre of Chronic.
Earlier, he was de facto to build the East space, but because of the differences in the Earth and Earth Infrastructure Centre (CNKI), he was transferred to the Moscow Fields, where the production coordination is involved.
Mr. Ohlopkov ' s repository will not be: the post of the technical director, mostly, will be leaving, and the officer will be displaced by the CNCK.
The Technical Director of the East and Representative of the CNCK Director on Technical Development of Andrey Ohlopkov has passed to the GCNPC, Chruniche's name, " E" reported to the top managers of several industries, as well as the government's equipment.
"He's working on a new post for a few weeks," the "E" conveyed in adults.
The CNCI operational comment failed on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the "E" information was officially confirmed in the CNDP.
He decided to go to the position of the Director for the Coordination of the Production, stated at the undertakings.
Mr. Ohlopkov passed to the CENKY in 2013, having a service in Space Armies, particularly in Baikonur, and in Plesque, the "nor" cosmodrome was posted by the first commander in the name of the Colonel.
In 2009, Andrew Ohlopkov was the figure of the voting case.
The consequence was accused of complaints: as if the commerce had been received from the date of the region, but did not carry out the commitments taken for the collection of parts of the rackets in the Archangel area and the Reply of the Commission.
In 2012, the court of the jury recognised it as innocent.
The responsibility of technology development in CNCI was extended to various projects, but it was mainly the creation of space at the Mount East.
The Federal Heaven, then, directly said that the situation in the Eastern " was critical in October 2013.
The fact was that the planning was enabled a significant error: the end of the building and the execution of the first launch of the Union-2.1 racket was planned at the same time at the end of 2015.
In order to deal with the road until the end of the year, they decided to finish the building for half ago and the period was mixed from December to July 2015.
In order to take the process, the CNCK specialists began to make a parallel installation of technology equipment on non-constructed objects.
The main part of this idea was Andrew Ohlopkov.
Despite the risks and yet the transition (the Union was flying only on December 2015 on 28 April 2016), this idea was justified, the source " E" on the space says: "If we would not have done any way from the East but would be able to build."
Vice-Premier Dmitriy Rogozin, who was smoking the creation of the space, called Andrew Ohlopkov his "cosmical Susanim", but almost always asked for information about the construction.
For Mr. Ohlopkov and directly: for example, in the interview of "E" he proposed to lose the Federal Federal Agency on Special Construction (Specstress) status of the only East artist and try to work with subsequents: "Why should we all eggs be placed in one Spacestroy waste?"
This idea found support in the government.
Since 2017, the CNCC took the responsibility of the General Supplier to allow the fourth quarter to finish building work on starting and technical complex.
According to the " E", Mr. Ohlopkov's way to move to the new place of work was a distinction with the CNCC ways to complete the creation of cohesions and complications of space, as well as the methods of work with subsistents.
"It was decided that it would be better for all," says one of the top managers who participated in the Eastern Report.
The Government’s partner, in turn, calls for a strange decision, "He was one of the best experts, and it would not be easy to replace him."
This will not be required: the position of the Technical Director of the Space will be exercised and its functions will be dismissed by the CNCK.
A two-special training programme will be held in schools
In the future, the students of the School of Figures will receive two specialities at the same time.
According to the Department of Science and Education of Saint-Slaves, the Department of Science and Education of Saint-Slaves can be re-readed to the participants who repeat disciplines, and the question of paying the rest of employment for second speciality to decide with special grants is transmitted by the " RIA News".
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue to control, and we and the expert community have a mechanism that will allow two specialities to be exhausted, but at the same time it will not be contrary to the existing legislation in the field of education," said Golubbenko.
At the past Friday, the student Mary Andréva reported that it was necessary to pay repeated items for the second speciality of the CMS at the Moscow conservation.
The girl's race, who learns by the class of scratch and fortepiano and has the reward of competition in both directions.
The Chairman of the State recognized her question very acting and promised to help.
I've been arrested for the 17-year-old Russian
The 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who is arrested on the wall of the high-scale, reports the Portal El Universal.
The incident occurred in the capital of Mexico.
Youths, using two unnecessary men, passed through a three-meter trimestrial campaign to the territory of Nestle's office records and took it to one of his towers.
He did not have any special insurance, insurance, and insurance.
They've been arrested by a young man on the throat.
Co-operators of the Ministry of Public Security dropped him to the ground on a hostel.
After that, he was sent to the National Migration Institute.
There are acknowledging whether the youth is legally on the country's territory.
Meanwhile, a video with a young man who is up to the high place became a pope in the Network.
The students called the young man-pouke.
According to the MMI, such experiments I'm going to be hobbies for him.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help to facilitate the HCV.
Red meat and chocolate are adopted to be a cosmar for your food track.
However, recent studies relate to the reverse, that the diet rich with meat whites and milk products can help to facilitate the symptoms of those suffering from inflammable illnesses.
This is an unhealthy disease from which approximately 1.3 million people suffer in the United States and 300 000 in the United States, which is to quantities and exhaust life, chronic or blood weakness, loss of weight and extreme calamity.
It is usually advised to avoid meat and milk products, but researchers from the Washington University found that the main aminocytote was three times contributing to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerance of the box.
The conducting study of Dr. Marco Colonn explained that immune cells in the box are monitored in order that food-related microbs do not get into the body.
Cells that are able to start the process are equivalent to cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and not to be sensitive.
If the equivalent is too intensely distorted on the side of the burning, it may lead to an enormous illness of the box.
Experiences showed that the muscles with a certain bacteria in the box have increased tolerance of the cell.
And this bacteria needs three times -- one of the building elements -- to start the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colona said, "We have established a relationship between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus re§i - which is part of the normal microbium of the box, and the development of the population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptofan contained in the mouse feed, the more they had of these immune cells."
He suggested that the same would be the same in humans: the combination of L. re.i and the rich threefold diet can contribute to more tolerant and less decline to the breath of the environment in the kitchen.
The post of Dr. Louise Servantes-Baraganvas, studying the diversity of higher immune cell tolerance, discovered that one group of experienced muscles had these cells, and another group that belonged to the same line, but contained significantly.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the microbium of the mouse kitchen - by the bacteria, viruses and rubber communities, which would usually be held in the iron-bottle track.
The DNA of the mouse box cells was sequented, and six types of bacteria were found in the mouse with immune cells but with the mouse without them.
Mouse produced in the sterile environment without good microbium and not developing this type of immune cells received L. re§i, and immune cells appeared in them.
In order to understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers have grown L. r. in the heat environment and then have transferred small weight portions - without bacteria - to non-evolved immune cells from the mouse.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was weighted, it was a side product before triptophan, which is an indol-3-milch acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptopan in the mouse, the number of these cells increased by approximately 50 per cent, but when the triptophan level was doubled, the number of cells also fell twice.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same higher tolerance of the cell as with the mouse, and most of us have L. re§i in their iron-bottle track.
It is not possible whether side-products of triptophane from L. re.i contribute to the development of cells in humans as in the mouse, but in those suffering from inflammable illnesses, in genes that have been detected with tripto.
She says, "The development of these cells is likely that we need to strengthen, since these cells depend on the processes on the internal surface of the sticks.
High levels of triptopana in the case of L. re.i may potentially enhance their population."
Jose Mourinu, Manchester Younated, said, "Genia" in the face of Nienei Maticha
Manchester Younated has taken “ganies” in the face of Namnia Maticha, considering Jose Mourinu after the half-protector is deeply deeply in the moth against Sampdoria in the middle of the evening.
The player obtained for 40 million pounds in Chellsi started by a winning with 2-1 in Dubline in the last precesion cat of the UNAID before the wheel Supercubka WEFA against Real Madrid on Thursday and became an impression in the role of the protector, while players like Pogba and Andreas Preirs were spent before they were determined.
However, since Matich did not participate in the precesion tour of Chellsi in Asia, he was seriously unable to prepare for the game, and he held only 45 minutes that Mourina, accordingly, requires prior to the beginning of the Premier Liga season.
"He needs time, but his experience, mind, genius, how he thinks, he thinks of football," said Moureen.
"We will help him to prepare forward than forward."
Similarly, as Matich, his new players Victor Lindelef and Romelu Lukaku started to play at the Aviv stage when Mourinu began to form its main set for the beginning of the season.

The British inventor used a microchipe to fall into the house and the car on the hands
The British inventor is the first person in the country who has set a microchipe to open the door of his house, enter into the office, and even drive a car with a simple hand-taking.
The 30-year-old Stephen North has enjoyed a small chip between the large and indicated fingers and now through its BioTeck firm will provide this service to companies and private persons who want to simplify their lives for technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, annesthesiologist advisor from the Royal of Winchester, forgetting that the procedure of use was conducted in medical standards.
Technology is like a microchipe that uses cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces locks in houses and machines for a price of 300 pounds per one lock.
A married father of a child has already established the technology in his home and in his car BMW Z4, which is stuck when his hand is on the road.
Requisite for White House has been charged for tax payers in thousands of dollars
According to the records of the inflammated forces provided by the TIME magazine, the decision of the White House in the past month to take the sea pivotal on the South Lake on the business dedicated to the American Industrial Production was charged for the total of $24,000.
White-Green Sikorsky VH-3D, which is “Marine One” when the board is boarded, is the central element of the 17 July held in the White House of Affairs in which the American Construction Programmes were demonstrated.
President Donald Tromp, Vice-President Mike Pens and high offices of White House have examined technology products from all fifty states.
The vertebrate produced in Conne ́kute was exhibited near the ice of Man, the fire car from Wisconsin and the Missisipe car car.
According to the records of the First ESCADRILE of Sea Pechota Headers (HMX-1), the responsibility for the management of the hostel, the white House's military administration was intended for the presence of a hothole in particular, or FRAGO, only 36 hours before the holiday was landed on the South Lake in the case of a "normal" business.
"I just wanted you to be sure that you are in the course because this is a very wide range of business in the press," wrote the commander HMX-1 in the electronic letter to his leader, the first replacement of the marine aircraft of the sea coast, to be undertaken.
The letter indicated that the hole would come to the South Lake at approximately 7 hours in the morning of 17 July to participate in the 3 hours of day and remain there before the gason will be released between 6 and 9 evening on the same day.
The letter adds that if the transfer from the White House is detained, the second equipment will be required for re-flying at the hours of work.
The first exhibition was conducted by a carrier during the business, and the division protection remained close to the aircraft until it was on the ground.
The records received by the TIME report remained unexpected if the second exhibition had been required.
The Hatcha Act prohibits federal servants to enhance public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 indicated whether the action would not be contrary to this establishment.
“In addition, we asked whether it was a violation of the law of Hatch, and we answered that it was not”, wrote the commander.
"It seems you're going anywhere," answered the director's deputy.
The ‘American’ business was announced by the White House as an official business, and the Hatch law was not spread on it.
But even official businesses have political notes.
In the course of the committee, the Chairman made efforts to continue the health reform that was at the same time in the senate, and thanked the attempts to regulate governmental arrangements.
The exposure of aircraft, such as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes, is not a new statement.
The Chairmans are intended to take care of them for travel.
But to ask them only for interests.
Trump has already been subject to discussions in February when the president's airport went behind during his first pre-elected mine in Melbourne, Florida, and his account in your office was revoked with the complaints for the use of the president's aircraft to his preliminary.
“White house in exhaustion from the indication “Finished in America” in which products from 50 states made by American slaves from American materials were presented”, said the replacement of the press secretary of the White House Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 teams often carry out training plans around the Washington Aglomeration and on the South Lake to enhance the transport of the President of the United States to the White House with accuracy to the dhu.
When Trump was at the G-20 in Germany at beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training posts at the White House.
According to one of the factors, the aircraft carried out for the “After-American activities” was estimated by the equipment on the basis of a monthly training flights.
On that day, the offices were also on 11 additional hours in the framework of " non-Presidental tasks for support".
According to the White House, none of the other expenditures presented for businesses were costed by tax payers.
Sikorsky's representative reported that the company did not participate in the demonstration organisation of the hostel on the South Lake.
HMX-1 does not take account of the budget for the president's plans, and it is to determine the exact amount of business.
However, in the 2017 fiscal year, the VH-3D Defence Defence Defence Defence Tax is $24,380 per hour.
The department records stated that the time of the aircraft was 30 minutes each side from its airline based on the sea-base of Quantiko's aircraft in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real value of the use of the hole is much below this rate.
“To calculate the value of tax payers based on an example of refund rate, it is completely wrong”, says Walters.
“These examples include personal construction, service and many other non-training costs, including annual assets.”
According to the investigation carried out by the RND corporation in 2015, the refund rate does not include the cost of the personal cost, but, in fact, take account of the value of the fuel, services and expenditure set out in the Treaty.
At that time, the former press secretary of the White House, Shawn Spaiser, said to protect the use of a hostel for business.
"The idea is to demonstrate the things made in America on this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connekut's company are very harmful about their contribution to national security and what they do, I guess, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose job is more dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of this hole and other military technology on which so many Americans have worked continually.
That is why, of course, it is appropriate to focus on this."
It was unexpected that Trump was interacting with the hole, looking at the South Lake during the business, but he was exactly sitting on the driver's car in the fire car.
Inside the white House, Tromp contacted Sikorsky's representatives with a pressure on the subject of its own floor of the product of the company.
"I know "Sikorsky", said the president. "I have three of them."

Not a decade of the efforts of the Council and post-consequent authorities of Buratia (East Siberia) to establish justice tariffs for electricity consumers begin to give fruit.
From 1 September to 25 per cent, the cost of electricity is decreased in low pressure for industrial beneficiaries.
