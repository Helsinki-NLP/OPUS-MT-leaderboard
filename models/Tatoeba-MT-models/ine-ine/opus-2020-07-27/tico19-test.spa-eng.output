How longer or less you have these symptoms?
and always the throat pain should be treated in this way, especially at its age
and also February
and should also control your cholesterol and blood pressure
And you have a fever now?
And you feel this lock pain now?
and also has difficulty to breathe
And can you tell me what other symptoms you have besides this?
And how many he had of the fever
And I've got too.
And I've got a little fried and yours.
And today I really have a very strong knife pain
and this is the time for your alergy to the powder
and the lock pain appears
And I think I have a little fever.
And I want you to describe where the fat pain feels
and they're having something of febrer too
and with their diabetes' advances
And you know, I'm feeling that I'm stuck.
And you know, people's kissing me over all the time
and feels fat pain
And he said it was a pressure on the ass
someone in the family has a heart problem, heart disease, heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
Does another symptom or problem you note besides the muscle pain?
Are other people like you with the same symptoms in your house?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Do you have something to miss air?
still feels pain in the neck
Because this is the gripper season
but they shouldn't ignore us by the pain of heart knife
but now a more important problem is this lock pain
But I have difficulty to breathe
But I know that many people's kissing me up.
but we always have to treat the throat pain with the maximum seriousness
But now you're breathing well, right?
for this lock pain, I've completely seen myself
it feels like someone struck you with your ass
still feels like air failure

I also have something difficult to breathe
I'll send you a picture
I've got a little lock pain today.
Today I just have a little head pain and a little fever.
in my opinion, it's a grip.
in my opinion, it's a little grip
Is it like someone really, very heavy would sit on his ass?
all empe_ with head pain and fever more or less at the same time
I'm pained in the middle of the fat
is a pressure like clothing pain
is on my ass

Accumulated incidence in rapid increase in the disease by coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The accumulation of cases of illness by coronavirus (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Space and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, although the country is different, the COVID-19 pandemy is quickly progressing in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a COVID-19 patient hole that will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomeration of cases of unknown ethology neumony in Wuhan, province of Hubei, China was informed.
On 9 January 2020, the Chine Control and Prevention Centre informed that the caused agent was a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence at the date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a light disease, i.e. an inflammation of respiratory traction with or without neumony, and that most are recovered.
In 14% of the cases, COVID-19 develops to a severe disease than re-hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases develop a critical disease that re-intensive care.
Morality in patients hospitalized by COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine the trends in the accumulated COVID-19 trends in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Space (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (RU) and compare them to those of the Province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EE countries and the RU with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EE and the RU
After China, COVID-19 continued to propagate geographically and the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemy in the rest of the world is currently followed by this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemy.
On 5 March 2020 Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. informed the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with the definition of the WHO case.
In the EU/EE, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020, in persons who had returned from Wuhan, Province Hubei, China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in the 30 countries of the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom (RU), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date of inclusion, were recorded 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths, 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths only in Italy.
Recovery of the cumulated amount and accumulated accommodation of cases of COVID-19
In the European Centre for Sickness Control and Prevention (ECDC), COVID-19 cases reported in each country only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 p.m.
These data were used to examine the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EE and the RU and to compare them with Italy.
As indicator of the prevalence of the active cases of COVID-19, we calculate the accumulation of cases of COVID-19 to 14 days; in this way, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEE and RU country during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the collected amount of cases reported in each country to 15 March 2020 at 8:00 p.m., compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 tendances in the EU/EE countries and the RU
The trends in the accumulated COVID-19 cases are at 14 days in the EU/EEE countries and the RU generally followed the province of Hubei (China) (figure 1).
In the EU/EE and the RU generally, COVID-19's accumulated importance comes to increase around 21 February and then increased consideration by 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was primarily due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all the other countries of the EU/EEE and the RU showed increased trends of the cumulated COVID-19 similar (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulated amount of COVID-19 cases in EU/EE and the RU countries, compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It emphasises that, on 15 March at 8:00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEE countries and the RU countries had already registered a total number of cases comparable to the Italian only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases are quickly increased in the EU/EEE and the RU.
The trends observed in the accumulated COVID-19 suggest that pandemy is going to a similar rate in all countries.
This is so, despite the different stages in which countries, variables in national public health responses and, possibly, different definitions of case in countries and different protocols to choose patients who should be subject to the test to confirming COVID-19, including the delayed tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, Italian doctors described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 would need intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on case admissions of COVID-19 in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEE level only for 6 % and 1 % of the cases respectively (no data are shown).
However, the current monitoring data which are focused on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths should be collected systematicly.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed a great variation in the intensive and intermediate care beds in Europe, which was from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds each 100 000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive and intermediate care beds each 100 000 inhabitants in 2010-11).
Model scenarios relating to the saturation of medical care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EE countries and the RU of the prevalence of hospitalization cases associated with a risk of > 90 % over the capacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid evaluation of the ECDC risk on COVID-19.
Since at present cases have been conglomerated in certain regions of EU/EE and the RU countries, and hospitals and intensive care units are normally addressed to a defined regional captation population, information on cases and intensive care beds should be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of Statistical Territory Units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italian experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemy is quickly progressing in the EU/EE and the RU.
The countries, hospitals and intensive care units should, on the other hand, be prepared for a supported Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who repeat medical attention and, in particular, intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the rapid evaluation of the ECDC risk, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and integral approach to slow up the SARS-CoV-2 propagation, with a change in content approach to one mixture, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not give sufficient time to the responsible for decisions and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response in a way agreed if it is not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also includes the necessary public health measures to reduce the impact of pandemy.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the possibility of deepening their control efforts to prevent the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, the health systems of other EU/EEE countries are to be held to a hole of patients with intensive care in the next days and weeks.
The broadcast of illness by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), has even caused the death of 3000 people and has infected more than 80 000 people in China and in other parts of the world, which generated a catastrophe for humans.
Similarly to his homologic virus, SARS-CoV, which caused the SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the muscle and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a severity and a mortality less than the SARS, but it is much more transmissible and more affecting people than younger and more men than women.
In response to the increased number of publications on emergency disease, the purpose of this article is to make an opportune and complete analysis of the research topic, which is quickly developed.
We will treat the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethology, virology, diagnostic, treatment, prevention and disease prevention.
Although many questions have no answer, we hope that this analysis helps to understand and eliminate this threatening disease.
The Friday Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unusual and immortal memory for all Chinese who were urged to stay home during the whole festival and for several weeks more due to the break of a new virus disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (OMS) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called a disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic eats in Wuhan, China, and was quickly spread throughout the country and almost 50 countries more than all over the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 data and more than 3,000 dead patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number" and that is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
Pursuant to PubMed (https://www.europabi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) in less than two months, more than 200 scientist articles on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, ethology, diagnostic and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The objective of this analysis is to resume progress in research on this new matter quickly developed.
If possible, we will compare COVID-19 with the SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a broadcast in 2012).
We will also examine what is known until now on the prevention and predict of the disease, as well as some decision-making questions that have not yet been answered.
The coronavirus has traditionally been considered non-letal patogens for humans, which mainly provoke about 15% of the common frozens 4.
However, in this century, we have found two times with highly pathogen coronavirus in humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused originally a break in China, 2003, and in Saudi Arabia, respectively in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with a terrible mortality and mortality.
Thus, the current broadcast of COVID-19 is the third by coronavirus of which is registered in the history of mankind.
As shown in Figure 1.1, conglomerated of unknown origin neumony, Wuhan was first reported on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was known.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was registered in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic was rapidly spread to cities, provinces and neighbor countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medical care providers was informed, which suggested that transmission between humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was put in quarantine and all public transports were suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, from 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan marine market that was considered the origin site of an unknown animal source infection.
On 30 January, the WHO declared to the bridge a world healthy emergency.
At the date of this report, the disease has already been spread throughout China and almost 50 countries over the world (fig. 2).
Since the situation is quickly developing, the final dimension and severity of the breakdown cannot be determined yet.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentral study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more updated illustration of the epidemic described hereafter (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHP1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly those from 30 to 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7 per cent) of infected people had more than 50 years, very few were less than 20 and only 14 infectioned people were less than 10 years.
SARS-CoV-2 was more infected than men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was largely expanded in conglomerated in Hubei and its areas.
In average, 5 days (of 2 to 9) between the appearance and the diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days ( between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days ( between 4.8 and 13.)
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (IC 95 %: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exposedly before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the time of massive mobilization before the Primavera Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44 % (IC 95 %: 1.10-1.86 %) and the adjusted mortality of the total of patients was 3.06 % (IC 95 %: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (mankind), age (≥ 60) and severe neumony.
Coronavirus are a large and enveloped virus subfamily containing a single-sensitive RNA.
They may be divided into four genes, such as alfa, beta, gamma and delta, of which alfacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are those who infect humans.
Spying glicoprotein (S) is one to its cell recipients, angiotensin 2 (ACE2) convert enzyme and dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then the membrane combination is produced.
Viral RNA genome is released to cytoplasm; then from the replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with the glucoprotein of the envelope and the nucleocapside proteins, forms of vesicculos containing virons, which are then merged with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was discovered as a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99,98 % in 10 sequential samples taken from the original site of the broadband: the market of Huan Seakins of Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With a electronic transmission microscope, parts of SARS-CoV-2 were found in ultradelegated sections of human respiratory epitele.
Human ACE2 was determined as a recipient of the SARS-CoV-2 as well as the SARS-CoV.
However, protein S of SARS-CoV-2 is to human ACE2 more weak than the SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNb; however, orf8 does not contain any known functionality or reason.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the Electronic Chryomicroscopy of the ACE2 full human length in resolution 2.9 Å, completed with the B0AT transporter amino acid
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed compliance, seemed as dimmer, and that completion ACE2-B0AT1 could join two proteins S, which provide evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic diana for the study of medicines to eliminate the infection of SARS-CoV-2.
Source and intermediate guest
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in murderers and transferred to humans through civetes and camels respectively.
In a philogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, the muscle was considered the native guest of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical in 96% to two coronavirus similar to the SARS of murcelagers called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown what intermediate guest helped the virus to cross the barrier of the species to infect humans, and remains diluting the way of transmission.
Ji, et al., proposed the serpents as ports of the human murciélag virus, which involved homologic recombination within the protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long hocic maphers feeding of wheat and intending to be used in the traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate guest of SARS-CoV-2 based on a genetic homologation of 99% in a coronavirus deserto in pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1 % propagated by the total of two genes remains a great difference; therefore, concluding results are expected with concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and the heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; the heat, ethanol at 75 %, a desinfectant with chloride, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective to disable the virus.
All human populations generally lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and, then, is susceptible to the new coronavirus.
Until the present, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Therefore, we can only recover to previous studies with other coronavirus, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4).
Generally, after invading the guest virus, it is first recognised by the inmunity system inhibited by the guest to the patron recognition recipients (PRR), including lectinas type C, Toll (TLR), NOD (NLR) recipients and RIG-I recipients (RRLR).
In different ways, the virus introduces the expression of fluctuating factors, the matureness of dendric cells and the synthesis of type I (IFN) interferons that limit the propagation of the virus and accelerate the macrofactic fagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N can help virus escape from immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is to the fight against virus.
The T Linfocites, including T CCD4+ and CD8+ Cells, perform an important function in defence.
Cells T CD4+ stimulate to cells B to produce specific antibodies for the virus, and T CCD8+ cells directly kill the cells infected with the virus.
T-cells cooperate produce pre-inflammator citokins to help defensor cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of the T cells by inducing the apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunity, which includes plugins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, the isolated antibodies of a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, a excessive reaction from the immune system generates locally a large number of free radicals that can cause severe damage to lungs and other organs, and in the worst cases, multiorganic failure and even death.
The infection of SARS-CoV-2, characterized by the appearance in conglomerated, affects more likely older people with pregnancy and pregnant women.
It is common that people who are exposed to a large amount of virus or whose immune functions are committed are more likely to infect themselves than others.
The average estimated average of the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, more than 3 to 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a 1099-time study shows that the incubation period was 3 days in a average and was low from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described earlier, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (entre 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographic of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the time of efficient quarantine depending on the more precise incubation period; this is the way that asymptomatic people will prevent the transmission of virus to others.
As usual practice, persons exposed to virus or infected normally should remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever often is the main and initial symptom of the COVID-19, which may be accompanied by any other symptoms or other symptoms such as thickness, disnea, muscle pain, married pain, head pain, throat pain, renal pain, diarrhoea, diarrhea, nausea and vomit.
Some patients had disnea or hypoxemy a week after the disease appearance.
In serious cases, patients developed quickly until they developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, meta acid and coagulation.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and aggressive fever, even without pulmonary anomalies in image studies, should be tested for an early diagnosis.
A demographic study of the end of December 2019 indicated that the rate of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry tissue, 55% for diarrhoea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of the patients would require respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by transmission of a asymptomatic person.
Similarly, a demographic study of 2012 showed that patients with MERS-CoV were also fibres (98%), dry (47%) and disnea (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of them would require respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in accordance with the major letality of MERS in relation to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26 %) and bottle pain (21 %) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), dry tissue (29-75%), dysnea (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and gargant pain (13-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was needed at approximately 14-20% of patients.
For 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2% when the confirmed cases reached 66 576 worldwide.
Similarly, the SARS mortality for November 2002 was 10 % in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study of June 2012, the mortality was 37 % in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was high and increased to 6.47 with a confidence range (IC) of 95 % from 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV as regards symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.
The numbers suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its letality is less than the last two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV.
Appearance in conglomerated occurs often within the same family or from the same or vehicle, as a cross.
Patients should have previous trip or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected or patients in the two weeks before appearance.
However, it has been reported that people can carry out the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients with high-heighted patients can recover to the virus, signal of alarm that the time of carantine should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced quantity of white blood in periferic blood (specially linfocites) in the early stage.
For example, the linfopenia was observed with a white blood content of < 4×109/l, including < 1x109/l linfocytes, and high aspartate aminotransferase levels in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
Heavy and muscular enzymes and myglobin levels were high in the blood of some patients, and reactive protein C and erythrocytical sedimentation were high in the blood of most patients.
In patients with serious cases, dimero-D, a product of degradation of fibre present in the blood, was high, and the volume of linfocides was progressively reduced.
Anomalia is detected in the toracic radiographics of most patients with COVID-19, characterised by shadows or bilateral stirring opacities in lungs.
Patients are planning to develop athic neumony, a heavy lung lesion and an aggressive respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA is produced, discontrolled inflamation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis are seriously affecting gas exchange.
The disfunction of type I and type II neumovites decreases the surface level and increases the surface pressure, which reduces the lung capacity to expand and increases the risk of lung collapses.
As a result, the worst findings in toracic radiographics are likely to be parallel to the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the dismantling of neumotives, the formation of a hyaline membrane and infiltration of linfocites in the interstition, and multi-nuclear symptical cells in the lungs of a patient died due to disease, which coincide with the pathology of a virus and SDRA disease, and similar to the patient with SARS and MERS.
The detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RN through a reaction in the stream of polymerase with inverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) is used as the main criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of negative employment, which could accelerate the epidemic, the clinical manifestations for diagnostics (not longer based on the RT-PCR) began to be used in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of the SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease advances, clinical manifestations, radiologic tests and findings is essential and implicit for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a CRISPR-based SARRS-CoV-2, which detected synthetic fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 RN between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microliter of sample) using a scale graduated in less than one hour that does not repeat full instruments.
Fortunately, the new technology can drasticly increase sensitivity and conviction if it occurs in clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide support for patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies used or proposed before the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (table 2).2).
These treatments include current or potential treatments with antiviral medicines, immunosuppressors,steroids, recovered patients plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It is proposed to use the plasma of recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develop antibodies and vaccines against virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is primarily attacking the lungs at the beginning and, probably, attacks, at a smaller degree, other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the digestive device and the renals.
However, disfunction and respiratory insufficiency are the most threat to patients and the main cause of death.
As a result, respiratory assistance is critical to alive symptoms and save lives, including general oxygenotherapy, high fluid oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation in accordance with the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extra-corporate oxidation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of potentially mortal cardiac or respiratory insufficiencies.
Furthermore, maintenance of electronic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of the functions of vitale organs are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Citokine storm is known as the result of an excessive immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
Citokin storm is a form of systemic inflammation response characterized by the release of a series of citokins, including TNFa, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNa, IFNb, IFNg and MCP-1.
These citizens introduce immune cells to free a huge number of free radicals that are the main cause of SDRA and multiorganic failure.
Immunosupression is essential for treatment of cito storms, especially in serious patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-receptor monoclone antibody of IL6, have been used to treat the cito storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cito storm are the modulation of the immune response directed by cells T; IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF blocking; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; a supplier of 4 cito-signal, and HDAC inhibitors.
Esteroids, such as immunosuppressors, were largely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of the inflamatorial damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
However, severe secondary effects, particularly osteonecrosis, may affect the prediction note.
However, the use of corticosteroids was recommended in low to moderate doses during a short period for patients with COVID-19 in critical state.
At the date of this analysis, the efficiency of any antiviral treatment has not been confirmed.
However, the efficiency of remdesivir, a nuclear analogy, has been checked intravenously in a patient and with COVID-19.
Redesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also showed the potential to inhibit other virus with monocatenary RNA, such as MERS and SARS virus.
On the basis of these, Gilead has provided the composite to China to take a couple of tests in infected persons with SARS-CoV-2, and there is a great expectation for the results.
Moreover, baricitinib, alfa interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible treatment for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomit, hepatic damage and other adverse reactions may occur after the combination of therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with other medicines used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibodies generation
The extract of blood from patients recovered from a convulsional disease to treat other patients who have suffered the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not face disease is not a new thing.
In fact, recovered patients are supposed to have a high level of antibodies against the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by linfocites B to fight patogens and other strange objects, and recognize certain mole in patogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from blood from a group of patients recovered from COVID-19 and was injected to 10 seriously.
Her symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction of the inflamation and viral burdens and a better oxygen saturation in blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and declare this to propose the method for its high-scale use until specific treatments are developed.
Furthermore, therapeutic effects should be considered delicately.
For example, antibodies can stimulate immunity response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which may result in mortal toxicity.
The blood antibodies concentration is usually low, and plasma request is high to treat patients in critical state.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat global pandemy.
Therefore, it is more important and more practical to isolate B cells of recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against the essential proteins of virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects are largely affected by a combination of several components in a form that varied the diagnosis of a disease in accordance with MCT theories.
Most effective components are still unknown or are impressive, as it is difficult to extract and check such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with light to moderated symptoms or for those who have been recovered from serious phases.
For example, it was determined that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in various provinces of China that used MCT in 87 % of their patients, including Gansu (63.7 %), Ningxia (50 %) and Hunan (50 %), while the province of Hubei, who used MCT in only about 30 % of their patients with COVID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13 %).
However, this is a very close comparison, since many other effect factors, such as the quantity and severity of patients, should be included in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and its colleagues published a study in which the treatment of Western Medicines (MO) was compared only with the combination of MO and MCT treatment.
They discovered that the times necessary for recovery of body temperature, loss of symptoms and hospitalisation were not less in the MO+MCT group than only in the MO group.
What is most surprising, the increasing rate of symptoms (leather to serious) was note less in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4% against 46.2%) and mortality was less in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% before 39%).
However, MCT's efficiency and safety are still expecting more well-controlled tests at larger and more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and to determine the effective components of the MCT treatments or its combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 generally have a lot of fear of highly contagious and even mortal disease, and Quarentene people also experience disappointment, singleness and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxie and tos, as well as the adverse effects of treatment, such as the insane caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental anxiety.
In the early phase of the SARS broadcast, a series of psychiatric mortalities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic excitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even self-suicide trends, was informed.
Trace of contacts and mandatory quarantane, as part of public health responses to COVID-19, can make people feel more nervous and guilty for the effects of county, quarantine and stegma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health should be given attention to patients with COVID-19, suspicious people and those who are in contact with them, as well as the general public you need.
Psychological support should include training of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and precise updates on SARS-CoV-2 broadcast and the treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
They are essential vaccines to interrupt the transmission chain of animal and human reserves infected to possible guests, and are added to the antiviral treatment in the control of epidemies caused by emergency virus.
The efforts have been made to develop vaccines based on protein S to generate powerful neutralizing antibodies and long-term or immunity protecting against SARS-CoV.
Vacuums with live viruss are evaluated in animal models for the SARS.
However, the in vivo efficiency of these potential vaccines in older people and the models of letal stimulation and their protection against infection by zoonotic origin virus should still be determined before initiating a clinical study.
This is probably due to the SARS extinguished 17 years ago and no new case has been registered since then.
However, there are still cases and conglomerates of MERS in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to perseverance of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategy for MERS has been developed using disabled virus, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanopartics, particulates similar to virus and recombinant proteins sub-onities, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunity people is an urgent and decisive task to control the current pandemy.
However, it is difficult to overcome difficulties due to the long period (18 months in average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronavirus.
As a new disease, the recent COVID-19 has started to demonstrate its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually be recovered without sequences.
However, as the SARS and MERS occur, COVID-19 is also associated with high mortality and mortality in patients with serious cases.
Thus, the establishment of a model of predict for disease is essential in order to prioritize health agencies, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported to this moment, the following factors may affect or be associated with the predict of patients with COVID-19 (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the SARS's prediction, which also results in accurateness for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was more than 30-65 years old and 47.7% of those patients had more than 50 years in a study of 8866 cases, as described earlier.
Patients who would need intensive care with higher probability had sublime complications and were considered greater than those who did not require them (with an age of 66 to 51), which suggests that the age is a predictive factor of the development of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 against 0.27/100 000), as described earlier.
Comercialities and complications: patients with COVID-19 re-intensive care with greater probability are suffering from an aggressive and arithmical heart failure.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported too can be joined to positive ACE2 colangiocytes, which may cause heavy dysfunctions in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to highlight that the age and the underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere between themselves.
Anormal results: Reactive protein C (PCR) in the blood reflects the severity of the inflamation or weight loss and has been proposed as a possible prognosic factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
Furthermore, the correlation between the level of PCR and the seriousness and the prediction of COVID-19 has been proposed.
Furthermore, a high level of deshidrogenase lactate (≥H), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and cinase creatin (CK) can also help to predict the development of the patient.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in various organs, especially the heart and the hygiene, and are released when weight is hurt.
Moreover, they constitute traditional brands of heart dysfunctions or hectares.
Principal clinical symptoms: Torax radiography and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with the other symptoms for the prediction of clinical disconnections and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described earlier, the steroids are immunosuppressors that are usually used as adequate treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were extended in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent incapacity and bad life quality.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described earlier, during the COVID-19 break, many patients have suffered a extraordinary stress, since generally they have supported long periods in quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and have assisted the death of neighbors and other patients.
It is essential to breathe psychotherapy and long-term support for these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal life.
In accordance with the demographic studies performed to this moment, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics than the SARS.
Besides replicating in the lower respiratory paths, SARS-CoV-2 can be replied to higher respiratory paths and cause light symptoms or not cause symptoms in the early phase of the infection, as happens with other coronavirus caused by common frozens.
Therefore, patients infected in early phases or incubation periods can produce a large quantity of virus during their daily activities, which makes an enormous difficulty to control epidemia.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered when patients were serious, while mostly transmission was not occurred in the early phase.
In fact, the current broad of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS break.
Great efforts are currently made in China, including the closure of Wuhan and the cities of the surroundings and the quarantine continued by almost all the population with the hope of interrupting the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures are generating a significant damage in the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, which indicates the disacceleration of epidemia.
The most optimistic prevision will be concluded for March and the descending stage will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., considered that COVID-19, which seems to be considered more infectious than the SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in so-called as well as pharmaceuticals in patients who had been recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks ago, which indicates that the recently identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to influenza.
However, signs have been seen promised in China due to decrease in the number of new cases, which indicates that the current strategies could be working.
Originally it was foretold that the ebola would cause up to a million cases with a half million deaths.
However, through a quarantine and strict isolation, the disease has been controlled.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may be weak in terms of infection and finally extinguishes or becomes a less patogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS is followed (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible to the toss or horn, and may also to the direct contact with contaminated materials with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the processes, which provides a new possibility of fecal oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were probably caused by infections in nosocomia, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 medical care providers.
Therefore, care should be taken to protect humans, especially medical care providers, social workers, families, colleagues, and even transactions in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first defense line that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of maskers; the use of chirurgical and respiratory maskers with N95 (serial number 1860) helps control the spread of virus.
Surgery maskers imped that the liquid gotics of a potentially infected person are transmitted through the air or attached to the surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 maskers (series number 1860) can protect from inhalation of small wheels as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5 % of the wireons can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both dimensions around 85 nm.
Since particules can penetrate up to five packed chirurgical maskers, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 (serial number 1860) and not chirurgical maskers.
Besides the maskers, medical care providers should use isolation baths in order to reduce the contact with virus.
Virus can also infect a person with the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 although he had used a N95 mask; the virus may have entered its body inside its inflammated eyes.
Therefore, medical care providers should also use transparency boxes or glasses while working with patients.
For the public generally affected or potentially affected areas, it is suggested that the population wash the hands with defective jabons more after the habit, in order to stay home in a voluntary quarantane and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet are considered to be an appropriate distance to keep people remote from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and avoid the propagation of virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, his high approval with the SARS-CoV was informed on 7 January 2020, it should have caused great warning in China for its experience with the SARS broadcast in 2003.
However, it was not only until 19 January 2020 that the Director of the Wuhan Sickness Control Centre to the citizens saying that the new virus had low contagiousity and limited reproduction capacity between humans, and that there would be no problems to prevent and contain disease.
This message refused to note the public's alarm, especially at the time the country was prepared for the Previous Festival, and the critical time was deployed to contain illness at the minimum level in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies should take this hard lesson and make decisionable improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when making public announcements, since each word is important for citizens and can make changes to their or their decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to inuistic information of the clinics, rather than waiting for the formal reports of doctors or officers; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic in their early phase, rather than to relax the public; and (4) more regular in implementing adapted and effective simulations to increase the public's consciousness on epidemic diseases and testing and enhance the society ' s response system periodically.
The broad of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus comes to the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has been spread throughout China and about 50 countries more than all over the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and the SARS, COVID-19 broad has generated the feeling of reapparition of the SARS.
However, there are some notorial differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain epidemia and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than younger and more men than women, and severity and mortality are also greater in older people than in young people.
The SARS has more mortality than COVID-19 (10.91 % to 1.44 %).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even though they don't present symptoms, while patients with SARS generally do it when they are seriously, which generates a much greater difficulty to contain the propagation of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 was much faster and generalised than SARS-CoV.
The regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA test may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, healed patients can give positive in the virus again.
These results drasticly increase the risk that virus is propagated.
In view of the so quick progress in the COVID-19 research, several important issues are still resolved, such as:
Where's the SARS-CoV-2 out of?
Although there was 96 % of genetic homologation between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronavirus of similar murderers like SARS, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from the murderers.
What animal was the middle species that transmitted the virus of the original guest, let's say, the murderers, to humans?
Without know the answers to numbers 1 and 2, it is not possible to break the transmission in a way, and the broad can rise at any time.
Although the molecular modeled and biochemical tests have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is accompanied with ACE2, how exactly the virus comes into the respiratory road cells and causes later pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve rapid and precise diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemie take?
How does the virus evolute geneticly when it is transmitted among humans?
Will it become a world pandemy, extinguish it as the SARS or periodically resurrect it as the grip?
Although it can take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these questions and to many others.
However, cost what it costs, we have no more option than stop epidemia as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the coevolution of coronavirus and their guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
By 2003, two human coronavirus caused light diseases, such as common frozen.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have invested the currency in discovering the devastation and mortality of human coronavirus.
The survey of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 placed the coronavirus in the centre of attention again and surprised us with a high transmissionability and a reduced patogenicity compared to his brother, SARS-CoV.
Infection by human coronavirus is a zoonosis and we would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus.
Most human coronavirus have their origin in the murderers, in which they are not patogenic.
The intermediate reserve guests of some human coronavirus are also known.
The definition of animal guests has direct implications in preventing human diseases.
Investing interactions between coronavirus and guests in animals can also draw important information on human coronavirus patogenic.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the knowledge existing on the seven human coronavirus, with emphasis in the history of their discovery, as well as in their zoonotic origins and in the transmission of species.
Note, compare and contrast the various human coronavirus from the perspective of the development of the virus and the recombination of the gene.
The current disease epidemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is analysed in this context.
Furthermore, the requirements for successful guest changes and the implications of the development of virus in the disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronavirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of monocatenary RNA virus with envelope.
These viruses, which host the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among the RNA virus, were called "coronavirus" due to their morphology, by the form of crown under a electronic microscope.
As regards their ↓, coronavirus have non-segregated genoms that have a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genom contain two large reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated in replicated polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein is still processed to generate 16 non-protein proteins called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genom contains ORF for proteins, including spy (S), of the envelope (E), of the membrane (M) and nuclear protein (N).
A series of specific protein accessories of each linage are also encoded by different coronavirus lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronavirus is classified in four genes (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, ↓coronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among whom the genus of betacoronavirus contains most human coronavirus and is subdivised in four lines (A, B, C and D).
The philogenetic evidence has shown that murciélags and rotors are the source of genes of most of the alfacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while birds are the main reserve of coronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
Thousands of years, the coronavirus have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have occurred as important human patogens.
Until the date, seven human coronavirus are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alfacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronavirus are HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, coronavirus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause light symptoms, such as a common frozen or diarrhoea.
However, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause serious respiratory infections in a higher amount of patients, with a higher probability of developing the aggressive respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and extrapolmonary manifestations.
The first tissue of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the narrow secretion of patients with common refrigerated in the middle of the dee of 1960.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated to exhaustive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, up to the SARS broadcast, it was a broadly accepted concept that infection by human coronavirus is generally inofensive.
The SARS broadcast that occurred in 2003 was one of the most devastaters of the present history and infected more than 8000 people, with a cruel letality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the breath of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) took place a persistent epidemic in the Arabic peninsula with spiral propagation to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which later was called SARS-CoV-2, is the caused agent of the disease epidemic for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which has been covered over 3120 lives and has infected more than 91 000 people until 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemy that is near.
The seven human coronavirus have a zoonotic origin in murderers, ratons or home animals.
Several evidence lines support the evolutional origin of all human coronavirus in the muscles, in which viruses are well adapted and are not patogenic, but present a great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has raised a huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenge in China and the rest of the world.
Traceing the human coronavirus zoonotic origins is a framework to understand natural history, impulsive force and the factors for the restriction of salt between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reserve and the intermediate and strengthening animal guests of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications in preventing the propagation in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and human coronavirus patogenic.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that human coronavirus parental virus normally are not patogens in their natural reserve guests, but that they return patogens after transmission of species to a new guest.
We also examine the evolution of human coronavirus, where the increase in transmissionality often leads to decreasing patogenicity.
The development of the current broadcast of SARS-CoV-2 is also analysed in this context.
It has knowledge of the coronavirus of animals since the end of the deep of 1930.
Before the first isolation of B814 of HCOV-229E of the Nasal Secretion of patients who had taken a common frozen, different coronavirus had been isolated in different infected animals, such as the powder, the mouse, the powder, the herd, the cat and the dog.
In the last decades, seven human coronavirus have been identified.
A short summary of the history of human coronavirus discoveries in cross-ogic order (table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first cup of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory paths of patients with infection of the higher respiratory paths in 1966 and then adjusted to grow in WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented symptoms of common frozen, such as head pain, horn, general disease and fat pain, with fever and tos in 10~20% of the cases.
Later, in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and the later serial pass in lactants brains.
The clinical characteristics of HCOV-OC43 infection seem to be similar to the caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to the infections by other respiratory pathogens, such as A influenza virus and renovirus.
both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed by the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter station in temperated climate.
Generally, the incubation time of these two virus is less than one week, followed by a period of illness of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healing people infected with HCoV-229E developed a light common frozen.
Only some immunocomprometed patients have presented a serious infection of the lower respiratory paths.
The SARS, also known as "atypic neumonia", caused the first pandemy caused by a well-documentated human coronavirus in the history of mankind, and the ethological agent is the SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS is replaced at the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 cases reported with 774 deaths and was spread by many countries and continents.
Besides superprojectors, it was estimated that each case could cause sometimes two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of the maximum viral burden on the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially presented mialgia, head pain, fever, general disease and scalophry, followed by disnea, toys and respiratory difficulty as late symptoms.
Linfopenia, changed hepatic function and high level of kinasis creatinine are common abnormal results in SARS tests.
Difused alveolar damage, proliferation of epitelial cells and increased macrofags are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients later re-reactivate intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
Besides the lower respiratory paths, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tube, the higado and the renal, can also be infected in these serious cases, normally accompanied by a citokin storm, which could be mortal, especially in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-heaven lung biopsie of a family of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made to research human coronavirus.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month child from the Netherlands for the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevalent in small children, adults and immunocompromits with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of core, conjunctivitis, fever and bronquiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus of a nose sample taken from a 8-month child suffering of neumony in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed by the world.
It was estimated that HCOV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of the common respiratory diseases, and its maximum importance occurs at the beginning of summer, primavery and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laringitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with neumony and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to nemonia and bronchiolitis obtained in the community, it was informed that HCoV-HKU1 was associated with asthma exacerbations.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was worldwide and caused light respiratory diseases.
These four human coronavirs purchased in the community have been well adapted to humans and are generally less intended to change to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown causes, such as in the short case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been informed that there was a serious infection on the lower respiratory routes in China.
Generally, when these human coronavirus adds the ability to translate and maintain continuously in humans, they also return less virulents or patogens.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient who had developed aggressive neumony and renal insufficiency in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the Middle East are originating, cases imported with occasional contagio to close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia have been registered.
Another secondary fraction occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS' clinical manifestations are similar to the SARS, characterized by progressive acute neumony.
In contrast to SARS, many patients with MERS also developed aggressive renal insufficiency, which is at the moment only given with MERS among human coronavirus diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomit.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases were registered, with a high letality of 34.4%, which becomes MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for people who have knowledge.
Since the middle to the end of December 2019, conglomerated patients with neumonium in Wuhan, province of Hubei, China, who retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the broadcasting of the lower respiratory paths caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health of international importance and also designated the COVID-19 disease.
On 3 March 2020, 90 053 cases worldwide were confirmed, with a cruel letality of 3.4%.
Note, letality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes serious respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, toss and disnea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Neumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop the symptom of aggressive respiratory difficulty.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of a high nuclear sequence homologation of 82 %, they are classified in different branches of the phyhogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 apparently is less patogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatics infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid propagation throughout the world.
When comparing and opposing SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronavirus, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
Firstly, the incubation period and the duration of the cycle of the disease by human coronavirus are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronavirus.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between the SARS-CoV and the four human coronavirus purchased in the community (e.g. HCOV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the infection by SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics that are most frequently observed in infections by coronavirus of humans purchased in the community, including the presentation of non-specific or light symptoms or, even, the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 is also observed as the infection by SARS-CoV, although the relationship is a little smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns both of human coronavirus purchased in the community and from the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissionability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least high as the coronavirus of humans purchased in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to verify whether the transmissionability of SARS-CoV-2 is decreased after steps between humans, as is the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fatal samples.
If the fecal oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a significant role, such as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it should still be diluted in future studies.
It has also been particularly interested in discerning whether SARS-CoV-2 could demonstrate stationality, such as the case of human coronavirus purchased in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissionability, patogenicity and sustainable propagation after human steps, will affect the final disconnection of the broadcast in the course of COVID-19.
The four human coronavirs purchased in the community that cause light symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four human coronavirus.
In other words, both could survive from ancient human coronavir pandemies.
Human coronavirs have been removed that cause serious diseases in humans and humans who have developed severe human coronavir diseases.
In order to happen this, human coronavirus should be replied in humans in a sufficient measure to enable accumulation of adaptative mutations contrary to guest restriction factors.
In this regard, as longer the SARRS-CoV-2 broadcast continues and how many more infectionates, more the probability that it is fully adapted to humans will be.
If it is properly adjusted, it would be difficult to stop it through the quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronavirs purchased in the community have been in human populations and have caused common frozens in immune people.
These viruses don't need a animal reserve.
In contrast, the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and their transmission between humans is insufficient.
They need to be maintained and spread in their zoonotic reservations and seek the opportunity to spread to susceptible human goals, possibly to one or more intermediate and amplifier guests.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics both with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and with the four human coronavirus purchased in the community.
It is highly transmissible as human coronavirus purchased in the community at least for the moment.
However, it is more patogenic than human coronavirus purchased in the community and less patogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see whether it will be fully adapted to humans and will be among humans without a reserve or intermediate animal guest.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronavirus, we will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of the evolution, natural, reservation, intermediate and human coronavirus amplifiers.
A animal acts as an evolutional guest of a human coronavirus if it is hosted to an east-related anticipation that is a high homologation at the level of nucleotic sequence.
Ancient virus is usually well adapted and is not patogenic in this guest.
Similarly, a reservation guest is a continuous and long-term human coronavirus.
In both cases, guests are naturally infected and are the natural guests of human coronavirus or their parental virus.
However, if the human coronavirus has been introduced into the intermediate guest just before or almost at the same time of its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new guest and often being patogenic.
The intermediate guest can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and carry out the function of enhanced guest by allowing the virus to be replicated transitionally and then transferred to humans to enhance the infection scale in humans.
A human coronavirus may cause a infection on the terminal guest if it cannot support its transmission in the intermediate guest.
On the contrary, human coronavirus can also be adapted to the intermediate guest and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reservation guest.
The epidemiological data repeatedly revealed that the initial case of SARS had been contacted with caught animals.
Following surveys on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Citizens of the masked palms (Paguma larvata) and a dog maps in the markets of living animals were the first identified virus carriers like SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly respited by the fact that there were no more cases of SARS after killing all market civilians.
However, it was reported that the civets of wild-masked palms or farms without exposure to the markets of living animals were most negative in SARS-CoV, which suggests that the masked palms civetes would only act as an enhanced intermediate guest, but not as a natural reserve of the SARS-CoV.
Note, since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammifers are also acting as an amplificating guest of the SARS-CoV.
All of them seem to be terminal guests of the SARS-CoV.
The following searches of the natural animal guest of the SARS-CoV discovered a coronavirus of murciélags is fully related, called CoV HKU3 of the Rhinolophus murcelago related to the SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese frogs.
These muscles are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the sequence of the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other coronavirus of murciélags have a nuclear sequence homologation of 88-92 % with SARS-CoV.
These studies have seen the foundations of the new concept that the muscles are located in human pathogens.
Several coronavirus similar to SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified in murciélags, but none, except one named WIV1, can be isolated as living virus.
The human enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of the SARS-CoV.
It was shown that the WIV1 obtained from a fatal sample of murderers uses the ACE2 of murderers, cyvets and humans as a recipient to enter into cells.
Amazingly, patients with convalent SARS were neutralised by WIV.
To this moment, the WIV1 represents the most eastly related anticipation of the SARS-CoV in murcelags, which is a 95% nuclear sequence homologation.
Despite the high homologation between these two viruses, generally, WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that the murderers are not the immediate reserve guest of SARS-CoV.
The philogenetic analysis is included, MERS-CoV is classified in the same group as the CoV-HKU4-Murcelago and the CoV-HKU5-Murcelago CoV.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same guest receptor, dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) for the input of the virus.
The sequences of polymerase RNA dependent on MERS-CoV RNs are philogenically closer to their contraparties of betacoronavirus of muscles identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, a live MERS-CoV can not be found in wild walls.
MERS-CoV and its nearest family, CoV-HKU25, have a nuclear sequence approval of only 87%.
Instead, the murderer may not be the immediate reservation guest of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary are seropozitive in neutralizing antibodies of MERS-CoV specifically, as the camels originating in several African countries.
A MERS-CoV live identical virus found in humans was isolated from the dromedary nose, which supports even more than camels act as good reserve guests of MERS-CoV.
It is also appropriate to highlight that, in general, light symptoms have been observed, but a massive propagation of virus in infectioned camels for MERS-CoV research.
Note, infected camels propagate virus not only through respiratory, but also by fecal oral, which is also the main way of spreading the virus of the muscles.
However, there are questions, since many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact with camels before the appearance of the symptoms, which is attributed to the transmission of humans or of unknown transmissions that will involve unrecognized animal species that are located in MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is a 96.2% nucleotic homologation with a coronavirus of murciélags, RaTG13, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis murcelags.
Like in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, the mursells may not be the immediate reserve guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the future coronavirus of almost identical.
The intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the forest species that are sold and killed on the majorist market of Huan's marine fish, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 have been associated, which indicates an event of transmission of animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on the metagenomatic sequence have suggested that a group of small mammifers in danger, known as pangolines (Javanica Manis), could also offer an anti-trail betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genoms of this new pangoline coronavirus are a nucleotic sequence homologation of 85-92 % with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equal to eastly related to the RATG13, with an identity of about 90% at the nuclear sequence.
They are grouped in two virus sub-lines similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the philogenic tree, one of which is more like SARS-CoV-2, with a 97.4% amino acid sequence.
In contrast mark, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the RATG13 are more different, despite a greater sequence homologation in the whole genom.
A previous study in pangolines also informed the detection of viral contingencies in lung samples, which also have been related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted various methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a sequence of partial genome that included approximately 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot reject the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, at present there is no evidence that it supports a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even less than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutive way of SARS-CoV-2 in murderers, pangolines and other mammifers should still be established.
Although the highest sequence homologation was found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are the highest total sequence homologation.
It is extremely speculative that the high level of similarity between the betacoronavirus betacoronavirus of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the average convergence evolution of selectivity.
An opposite proposal determines a recombination between the betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and the RATG13 in the third species of silvestre animals.
As an impulsive force in evolution, the recombination is extended between the betacoronavirus.
There has not yet been a conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Besides the highly pathogen human coronavirus, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU was also studied.
The philogenic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have been originated from the coronavirus of murciélags, while the HCoV-OC43 parental virus and HCoV-HKU1 were found in roads.
It was reported that a coronavirus of murciélags called ARCoV.2 (Coronavirus of the Apalahes Mountains) detected in a tricolored mourning of North America had a relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically related to another coronavirus of murciélags, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although it was also suspicious of Camelides as intermediate guests.
For more clearness, the knowledge of animal origins of known human coronavirus is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The philogenetic analysis has shown evidence of human coronavirus transmission events among species in history.
When HCOV-OC43 cross between species until he infected humans from animals of animals of animals in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemy was registered.
Transmission advances between species of HCoV-229E are not so precisely known.
Alphacoronavirus of murciélagus has been found as well associated with HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alphacoronavirus.
Several evidence lines support the transmission of murder virus to humans directly.
Firstly, in contrast to the alpaca, humans could have contact with murderers in a ecological nick.
Instead, humans have close contact with the alpacs.
Secondly, the alfacoronavirus of muscles related to HCoV-229E are different and not patogenic in the muscles, while the alpaca alfacoronavirus caused a breach of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alfacoronavirus of alpaca has not been found in silvest animals.
Therefore, the possibility that the alpacs add the alfacoronavirus associated with the HCoV-229E of humans can not be discarded.
In fact, the muscles are the direct source of patogen virus in humans, such as the wrath virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
In fact, it would not be too surprising that murderers would directly transmit HCOV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while the alphacoronavirus of murciélagus acts as a genetic acerve of HCoV-229E, alpacaes and dromeders could act as intermediate guests transmitting virus to humans, particularly in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, muscles to dromedary and human dromedary.
The evolutional origin of MERS-CoV in the murderers is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by later findings.
It is evident that muscles contribute to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and species.
Long-term, densely populated colonies, social interaction east and great capacity to flight, are all the favourable conditions that convert the murderers into the ideal "virusprogador".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into the dromedary by dedos.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have passed to be an intermediate guest, to be a stabil and natural reserve guest.
MERS-CoV causes very light disease and maintains a low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sprayal transmission to humans is a accident and humans are still a terminal hospital of MERS-CoV, since transmission is insufficient.
In comparison with the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if it were, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, is different.
In particular, the betacoronavirus of pangolines are highly patogenic in pangolines.
They may be a terminal guest of betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, such as civilians in the case of SARS-CoV.
Various possibilities of transmission between species of SARS-CoV-2 of animals to humans should be confirmed or rejected in future studies.
First of all, the murderers could be the reserve guest of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could have the ecological nine with the murderers, to the killing or carbon minery.
Secondly, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifier guests in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans have a virus to killing and consumption of jail meat.
Many mammals, including home animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An anti-corps study in home animals and forests is required.
Thirdly, as mentioned earlier, the recombination and adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact both the murciélags and the pangolines.
The search of the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Besides the different species of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronavirus crossing the barriers of species.
Firstly, their mutation rates are high in the replication of the RNA.
In comparison with other monocatenary RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of coronavirus could be considered "moderated" to "height", with a average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, by site 2, the stage of adaptation of coronavirus to new guests.
Coronavirus have an exorribonuclease of reading tests, with the elimination of extremely high mutability and attempt or, even invisibility.
Interestingly, the nuclear analogy remdesivir is known to remove the replication of coronavirus through inhibition of this exorribonuclease and RNA polymerase dependent on RN.
Redesivir is one of the most promising agents anti-SARS-CoV-2 who have been tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of coronavirus are nearly a million times higher than those of their guests.
Moreover, the mutation rate often is high when the coronavirus are not well adapted to the guest.
In comparison with the SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate appears to be less, which suggests a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is expected to have been adapted to another near human guest.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic derivatives make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 lose their effectiveness quickly.
Secondly, the long RNA genome of coronavirus exercises additional plastic in the change of the genom for mutations and recombination and thus increases the probability of coevolution between species, which promotes the appearance of new coronavirus when the appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the unicoded open reading frameworks and the functions of the proteins encoded to the 3' direction of the genom.
Thirdly, coronavirus changes randomly and often templates during the RNA replication through a unique mechanism of "copy-choice".
In a guest acting as a mixture vehicle, the chain change is often produced during the cronavirus RNA transscription.
Complete and high-homologic LED RNA could be recombined to generate new coronavirus.
Natural philogenetic recombination evidence has been found in the HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in the coronavirus of animals, such as the SL-CoV of murcelago and the CoV-HKU9.
Interaction with virus-house related to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the guest recipient is another key factor that affects the transmission of species.
Currently, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed the evidence of positive selection in species of transmission events.
On the basis of the comparative analysis between ace-covs of SARRS-CoV of humans and civilians, the SARS-CoV is considered to experience rapid adaptation in different guests, especially with mutations in the S-BD-BD.
Generally, the S-protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cell recipient and is intensely selected by the response to hospital antibodies.
In the SARS-CoV, the RBD is located in the amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1, which is joined to the human ACE2 and its receptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize the ACE2 recipients of several animals, including the murder, the cyvet, the mouse and the map dog, which allows transmission between virus species.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from human and cyvet virus seats in the RBD, and 4 of them are found in the reason for association with the recipient for interaction with the ACE2 recipient.
The SARRS-CoV of cyvets has mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD, which could increase the efficiency of the interaction of spike protein with the ACE2 recipient.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be fundamental for the adjustment of virus to humans.
It should be highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 is the same cell recipient with the SARS-CoV.
A difference of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in protein S1 means that the affinity of the protein S union with human ACE2 could have changed.
In fact, a study of electronic chryomicroscopy indicates the efficiency of this union 10 to 20 times greater than the human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be interested in determining whether any other recipient could be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetilated sial acid in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in humans, after transmission of species from their animal guests.
Besides cell recipients, the result of transmission between human coronavirus species is also determined by other factors of guest dependence and restriction.
The divergence of these guest proteins between humans and human coronavirus natural reservation guests, such as murciélags, dromedary and roads, could constitute an obstacle to transmission between species.
Human coronavirus must have the guest dependence factors and subvert the guest restriction factors so that the transmission between species is successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction with virus-house should still be identified and characterized.
It could be beneficial for a full-general investigation of guest dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the advanced CRISPR technology.
Appearance of new human coronavirus: we leave from zero
The diversity of the coronavirus of murciélags provides many opportunities for the appearance of new human coronavirus.
In this regard, the coronavirus of murciélagus acts as the genetic acerve of human coronavirus.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and genetic recombination stimulates the development of human coronavirus and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein encoder genes have the potential to dramaticly modify viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV access proteins, ORF8 was considered important in the adaptation to humans, since the virus of murderling related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but it was determined that different ORF8 proteins were encoded.
The elimination of 29 characteristics of SARS-CoV nucleotides was found at the beginning of epidemia in humans.
This elimination divides ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that promotes the change of guests.
Furthermore, the SARS-CoV has possible recombination advances with alpha and coronavirus lines, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions was identified in the polymerase RNA dependent on RNA.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the Epidemic MERS-CoV has suffered recombination events between different lines, which occurred in dromedary in Saudi Arabia.
Furthermore, the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have also been observed recombination events in other human coronavirus, where human coronavirus is recombined with other animal coronavirus in their non-genes.
It should also be warned that the artificial selection can contribute to non-demanded changes in viral genoms, which most likely results from released virus from the exercised selection pressures, for example by the hospital immunity system.
One example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype cepa due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
Although ORF4 could be observed intactate in the virus of murciellags and camels related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alfacoronavirus presents an insertion of a single nucleotide, which causes a change of frame.
Finally, though not at least important, the development of the new human coronavirus is also impulsed by the pressure of selection in their reserve guests.
No symptoms were detected or only light symptoms were detected when murciélags were infected with coronavirus, which indicates mutual adjustment between coronavirus and murciélags.
It seems to be well adapted to the coronavirus anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the pre-flame response in the muscles decreasedly the pathology caused by coronavirus.
Furthermore, the activity of natural murder cells in murderers is deleted due to the positive regulation of the inhibitor of natural murder cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of class I moleculars of higher histocompatibility complex.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive species of oxygen (ROS) generated from high meta-effective activity of murciélags could remove the replication of coronavirus and affect the test of reading of exorribonuclease, which results in the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogen virus ceps when introduced into a new guest.
More patogenic coronavirus caps could also develop by recombination, which would lead to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for gas adaptation.
Therefore, it is not likely that three new human coronavirus have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronavirus are not patogens or cause light symptoms in their reservation guests, such as murderers and camels.
They are energyly repeated without providing a strong immunity response to the guest.
This radiates secrets of why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes serious infection cases in humans.
Severe symptoms are primarily due to the hyperactivation of immune response and citokine storm, where as stronger the immune response is, more severe is the lung damage.
However, in the asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been disconnected from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same immunity response strategy could have beneficial effects on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in murderers.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early stage of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in humans should be beneficial.
Furthermore, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation is defective.
This reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the appearance of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a betacoronavirus of murciélags has been found with a 95% nucleotide homologation with the SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of murciélags that has a 96% nucleotics homologation with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been determined that civetes and other market animals are identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate guests of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Betacoronavirus of pangolines note homologs to SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which indicates that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests or that betacoronavirus of pangolines could offer gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are questionnaires, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 is made by the man, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronavirus have recovered protagonism due to the recent brake of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in murciélags and other animals has deeply changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservations of human coronavirus in human transmission.
The fair evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in the murderers and transferred to humans to intermediate guests.
Since the infection by SARS-CoV originates in the contact between human and civilians on the markets, closing the humid markets and killing the civilians in them could have been effective to defend the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolines should be removed from the humid markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, taking into account the discovery of several pangoline betacoronavirus lines is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, although and how SARS-CoV-2 is transferred to humans to pangolines and other mammifers remains to be diluted in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV exists in the dromeders for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, skin and lana for the local population.
They are largely distributed by Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as made in China with wild animal markets to prevent the propagation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent recovery of MERS fractions, an integral approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not to remove these viruses, new genotypes could appear that cause broke.
A variety of zoonotic coronavirus, are being in wildness.
In particular, the coronavirus of muscles with zoonotic potential are very different.
There are large possibilities that these zoonotic coronavirus evolution and recombination, which would result in the appearance of new coronavirus that are more transmissible or more mortal in humans in the future.
The culture of wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce the unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
From bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until the opportunity is present.
Although murderers have many characteristics that promote the propagation of virus, the opportunities for human contact with murderers and other silver species can be minimised if they are educated to the population to get away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammifers is necessary to better understand coronavirus and their natural guests, which will be useful to prevent the transfer of animals to human and future broadcasting.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is that humans are remote from the ecological nodes of the natural reserve of zoonotic viruses.
There are still several pieces in the rupture of the SARRS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin.
First of all, if the murderers transmit an anticipation of SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it will be interesting to analyze the circumstances in which murciélags and pangolines could have the same ecological nick.
Secondly, if murderers have a more direct role in transmission in humans, it should be determined how humans are in contact with murderers.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer acts as the real intermediate guest, it should be diluted how to interact with different species, including humans, murderers and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammifers, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
It is already a murderer, a pangolin or another mammifer, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or his parental virus that are almost identical are identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continuing research in this area will dilute the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria of the "supported cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 must be updated
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid advisory guide for diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guide included our experience and constitutes a good reference to fighting this pandemy worldwide.
However, the disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and our knowledge gradually increase on the basis of the results of current research and experience in clinical practices; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually updated.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria of "supported case" and "confirmed case" are the latest terms for diagnostic and treatment of the COVID-19 (seventh and seventh) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a break, which is now officially known as the disease of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named Coronavirus 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemy.
To combat the infection by SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a quick advisory guide that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
He has taken much attention since it has been published.
However, it is necessary to note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our conscience and knowledge are gradually increased on the basis of the results of current research and experience in clinical practices; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually updated.
For example, the Property for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven issues and some contexts have changed consideration.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., submitted a simple classification proposal on the basis of its clinical experience.
His work took new tests for our guidelines and also constitutes a valuable reference to this pandemy worldwide.
We support his important work and express our appreciation.
However, your work also needs updates is the latest for the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 (seventh version of the test) and recent studies.
Seventh and seventh (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspicious case, is necessary to combine any point of the characteristics of epidemiological advances with two points of clinical manifestations to make an exhaustive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be fulfilled if there are no clear epidemiological precedents:
epidemiological addicts: (1) travel or residence precedents in the city of Wuhan and the Netherlands, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the appearance of the symptoms; (2) previous contacts with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nuclear acid test); (3) previous contacts with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms of Wuhan city and the Netherlands, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been informed in the last 14 days before the appearance of symptoms; (4) previous contacts with groups of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas such as the house, the class, etc.
Clinical demonstrations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics of infection images by COVID-19; (3) total contents of white globules showing a normal, decreased or reduced content of normal linfocides in the early starting stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with some characteristics of patogenic or serological tests in the following way: (1) tests of reaction in real time for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of the full viral genom that shows high humidity to the recognised new coronavirus; (3) positive results for the specific IgM anticorps and IgG anticorporation against SARS-CoV-2 in a sure test; or a change of specific IgG anticorps against SARS-CoV-2 negative to positive, or increase of the title ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the aggressive phase.
We can see that the test of reaction of polymerase in real time to detect nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory roads was attracted to the second (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
The detection of patogens of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) editions, and then the serological tests were added to the seventh and seventh.
{NS}
Furthermore, there are any more evidence that remind us that we should be stumbled with the asymptomatic and atypical symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. fluid diagram should be updated, since they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The pointing system should also be checked in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we hope that there will be more direct evidence and we ask the readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "supported case" and "confirmed case", we recommend to search and comply with the newest guidelines of their country of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines in a timely way to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the maximum amount in one day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths yesterday because of COVID-19 in one day.
It's the largest number of deaths in one day due to virus.
By yesterday, the Bangladesh Epidemiology, Sickness and Research Control Institute (IEDCR) informed that the number of infectioned cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths has been recorded.
At a online information session, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the victims were four men and a woman.
Dr. Meerjady, two cases were more than 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years and one between 41 and 50 years.
He also said that two of the victims were from Daca.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemy COVID-19.
An hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news media, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anticorruption Committee, who was being in the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a online video announcement, the Minister for Travel and Poentes of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, said that the public transport would be suspended for more time than planned initially, until this next Sunday.
This suspension of public transport was initially started on 26 March and was expected to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical, fuel and food, was still allowed.
The first cases recorded by COVID-19 in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, two men returned from Italy and also the woman of one of them.
On March 19, these three had already been recovered.
More than a million infections by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of infection by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exceeded a million worldwide, is data from the University of Johns Hopkins.
At least 52 000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
The hito occurred on the same day when Malaui confirmed his first infections by coronavirus and Zambia had his first death related to the coronavirus.
North Korea afflicted on Thursday that was one of the few countries without infections by coronavirus.
On yesterday, the World Health Organization informed 1 051 635 confirmed cases, including 79 332 cases in the twenty-four hours before 10:00 p.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), of 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244 000 cases of coronavirus were registered with at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting the data from the University of Johns Hopkins, that Wednesday more than 1000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
In the world, the countries announced more strict measures to inhibit the propagation of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow's colleague, extended the city's close to May 1st.
At national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that the Russians would continue to receive their salaries without going to work until 30 April.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the state of national emergency 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes for, ten abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended the remaining touchs in the holy cities La Meca and Medina for the whole day; earlier, the remaining touch was only held between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
Thailand planned to implement a remaining touch between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until 1 May.
Supermarkets in a decrease of hygiene paper limits by transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarkets chains Wool and Coles decreased their hygiene paper purchase limits to two and a transaction package in all the supermarkets of the country respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were published as messages in boxes and Facebook pages of chains.
It was informed that the consumers were in fear of the COVID-19 if people had to be self-suspend.
On Wednesday, Wool ́ths also limited hygiene paper purchases to deliver home to a package by request.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages by transaction applied by Wool and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in its press communication on 8 March, informed that, with the application of the four packages restriction, "too supermarked even exhaust the product within one hour of delivery", and said that the request "not had" while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, said that it was "inexpected".
The sales went up with a "fortable increase" last week, if a Wool's voice.
The Supermarket Costco in Canberra also limited the amount of two packages last week.
In order to improve the absence, Coles requested larger packages to the suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Wool ́ths ordered additional existences, while ALDI placed existences available for a special offer of the planned midnight.
Zimmerman, Executive Director of Retailers, said that minorists are trying to increase the existence, but the restrictions on the local assembly on the timelines of carrier delivery are difficult.
I had an increase in production costs, according to the suppliers, try to satisfy the request, and less offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the anticipated release of existence, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer of Wednesday.
In a report in News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a minorist sale expert from the Queensland Technology University, said that supermarkets are being delivered every night.
He highlighted that the hygiene role is a volumen article, which causes a low amount of existence in numbers, and, when it is exhausted, leaves a wide range of space in the stones, which intensifies the feeling of lowness.
Coles and Wools have the idea of [that] if there were a quantity of the article in the stationaries, if products as hygiene and desinfectant paper roles could [build] and have large quantities, the panic would probably be minimised, said Zimmerman by ABC News.
The recycled hygiene paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that had disappointed the existence.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the hygiene role Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent, pointed out that they were working at the 24 hours of the day, the 7 days of the week, to keep the delivery, is the report in News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, informed that some property sellers offered free hygiene paper to the first applicant at the substances in Melbourne, when they were understood because the buyers had time for the long weekend of the Worker Day.
Thursday of NT News, a printed journal in Darwin, included an eight page record designed to cut and used as hygiene paper.
The supermarkets at the beginning showed reactions to imposing restrictions, a report of the ABC of 3 March, which said that they had no plans to introduce restrictions to purchase.
Zimmerman claimed that other products also have a lot of demand, including maskers, desinfectants, dry products, liquid jabbon and harine.
Similarly, outside of ↓a, Sunday afternoon, Ocado's supermarket on-line limited the purchases of the hygiene paper Andres to two 12 rolls packages.
The World Health Organization declares pandemy COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemy the broadcast on COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "pandemia" only refers to the quantity of the propagation of a disease, not as dangerous the specific cases, the WHO stressed the need to stimulate governments to take measures:
All countries still can change the course of this pandemy.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their people in the response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO said.
We are very concerned, both of the alarming levels of propagation and severity and of the alarming levels of inaction.
Dr. Tom peace, the Ex-director of the Centres for Control and Prevention of Disasters in the United States, is the "no" pandemy.
In statements published by CNN in February, he affirmed: "Apart from the influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced from appearance to continuous world propagation."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said, "never before we saw a pandemia caused by a coronavirus."
"And we have never seen a pandemy before that can be controlled at the same time," he insisted.
The new with pandemy comes after the WHO's decision in January to declare the break of a public health emergency of international importance.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Alergia and Infections in the United States, said about the broadcast, "in conclusion, it's going to deteriorate."
Even Thursday, Press informed that there were at least 126 000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The coronavirus pandemy 2019-20 is a cycling pandemy of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The broadcast was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, on 30 January 2020, and was recognised as a pandemy on 11 March 2020.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97 000 deaths as a result.
Approximately 364 000 people were recovered.
It was estimated that the letality rate for cases was 4% in China, while at the world level it was between 13,04% in Algeria and 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, thickness and lack of air.
Complications may include neumony and aggressive respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The time from the exposure to the appearance of symptoms, generally, is about five days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine.
Primary treatment is the symptomatic and supporting therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing the hands, covering the mouth when tossing, keeping distance from other people and control and self-isolation of those who suspect that are infected.
The authorities of the world responded through the implementation of travel restrictions, quarters, remaining touchs, risk controls at the workplace and closed installations.
The pandemy caused a severe global socio-economic change, the postergation or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the generalised absence of supplies increased by the purchases motivated by the panic.
Schools and universities closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, which affected approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Incorrect information on Internet virus was distributed, and genofobia incidents and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of ascending and south-east Asian appearance, and other areas with significant virus cases.
As a result of the reduction of the travel and closures of the heavy industry, air pollution and carbon pollution was reduced.
On 31 December 2019, the sane authorities in Wuhan, China, (the capital of the Province of Hubei) informed a group of unknown cases of nemonia, and an investigation was initiated at the beginning of January 2020.
The cases, most of them, were related to the majorist market of Huan's marines, therefore, thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the brote is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recent virus is well related to the coronavirus of the murciélags, the coronavirus of the pangolines and the SARS-CoV. Later, it was discovered that the first person who knew that the symptoms were manifested was held on 1 December 2019, and that person had no connections with the last group of the mixed market.
The first group of cases reported in December 2019 was determined that two thirds had a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an uncertain report from South China Morning Post suggested that, on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old person from the province of Hubei could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, the WHO informed that, as the new cases, reports were reduced in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a significant quantity of uninformed cases, especially those with lighter symptoms.
On February 26, a few cases were reported in youths, and those of 19 years and less were 2.4% of the cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the principal adviser of the United Kingdom, considered that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before an effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of persons subject to tests of COVID-19 and that have received a confirmed positive result is official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had proved more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies to not perform evidence in people who had only light symptoms, such as Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March showed that in China, until 23 January, a estimated amount of 86 % of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of 79 % of registred cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March considered that the amounts of infections in Italy were considered greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Control and Prevention Centres determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovered.
For those who do not, the time passed from the development of symptoms to death was between 6 and 41 days, as often as often as 14 days.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 97 000 deaths were assigned to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of the deaths corresponded to people over 60 years old, and 75 per cent had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular and diabetes. Official death records by the COVID-19 pandemy, generally, refer to the deceased persons who had been given positive in the test of COVID, are official protocols.
The quantity of real deaths because of COVID-19 may be much greater, since it may not include those who have fallen without having done the test, for example, in their homes, in the houses of elderly, etc.
Partial data in Italy showed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemy was the official COVID death record in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A voter of the Centres for Control and Prevention of Disasters (CDC) of the United States admitted "We know that [the quantity of deaths declared] is a subestimation," a corruption of the anecdotic reports in the United States. This subestimation is often in the pandemies, such as in the Switzerland influenza pandemy H1N1 of 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside the continental China occurred on 1 February in Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside the continental China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had informed deaths in all continents except the Antarctic continents.
These numbers were different to the region and with time, and they are affected by the quantity of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time passed from the start breaking and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases divided within a specified period.
The statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins, the global proportion of death on cases is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) to 10 April 2020.
The number was different to the region.
In China, the estimates of death in cases were decreased by 17.3% (in those appearing of symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the letality rate for cases, reflecting the percentage of persons who were missing due to a disease, and the letality rate for infections, which reflect the percentage of infected (diagnosed and unexpected) that failed due to a disease.
These statistics do not have a specified period and consider a particular population from the infection to the case resolution.
Some academics have calculated these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford considers that the rate of letality for pandemy infections is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimation of this rango is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analysed the impact of the tests on the estimates of letality rates for cases.
The OMS is that pandemy can be controlled.
The pipe and final duration of the broad are uncertain and can distinguish if the location is different.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania indicated, "Infective breaks, if they are not controlled, are generally stabilised and then begin to decrease when the disease remains without guests available.
But at this point, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prevision of which it will happen."
The Chine Government's Main Medical Adviser, Zhong Nanshan, claimed that " could end in June" if all countries could be mobilised to follow the WHO's recommendation on measures to stop the propagation of virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, from the Hygiene and Tropical Medicina of London, expressed that SARS-CoV-2 "will remain, possibly for one or two years".
The study of the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, the physical distance and other measures will be necessary "to be available to a vaccine (possibly 18 months or more).
William Schaffner from the Vanderbilt University expressed, "I think it's small that this coronavirus, since it is so easy, disappears completely" and "I could become a stational disease, which reapparies every year."
The virulence of reapparition would depend on collective immunity and mutation magnitude.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be not specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fat (88%) and thine dry (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of spot in respiratory paths (flema), loss of the sense of olfate, lack of air, muscular and articular pain, gargant pain, head pain, scalophry, vomits, hemoptics, diarrhea or cianase. The OMS is about one of each six people seriously faced and has difficulty to breathe.
The United States Control and Prevention Centres (CDC) are in the United States, the symptoms of emergency include difficulties to breathe, pressure or pain persistent in the breast, sudden confusion, difficulty to wake up and color in the face or the faces; before the manifestation of these symptoms, the immediate medical attention is recommended. The greatest progress in the disease can cause serious nemotion, a symptom of aggressive respiratory difficulty, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected persons may be asymptomatic, not present clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, the researchers therefore recommended to control and carefully examine those who have close contact with infected people to reject the infection.
The Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatics are of a few to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the time between the infection and the appearance of symptoms) covers one to 14 days; most often is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimation of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of olfate at the beginning was 30% and then reduced to 15%.
Some details are still determining how the disease is spread.
It is considered that the disease is mainly spread during the close contact and ≥ the small bottles produced by toser, stornout or speaking; the close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies are set out, without covering the mouth, goats can be moved from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 feet (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted to ≥ small bottles remaining in the air for more longer periods, which can be generated when talking. They can also produce respiratory bottles during exhalation, even when talking, though, generally, the virus is not transmitted by the air.
The goats can enter the mouth or narrow of those who are near or may be inhaled to the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP), can cause the dissolval of respiratory secrets and thus the air spread.
It can also be propagated when one touchs a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touchs the eyes, the narrow or the mouth.
Although there is anxiety that it can be transmitted to ≥ of the feeds, it is considered that this risk is low.
The Government of China refused the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the symptoms appear, although propagation can be possible before the symptoms and in the most advanced phases of the disease.
People had positive results in the disease tests until three days before symptoms appear, which indicates that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only some asymptomatic case reports confirmed by aid, but some countries have identified a asymptomatic transmission during contact trace investigations.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of Sickness (ECDC) states that, although it is not fully clear that the facility to spread the disease is generally infected by another two or three persons. The virus survives hours a day on the surfaces.
Specificly, the virus was detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and inoxidable steel 304, one day in carton and up to four hours in cover.
This, however, varied from humidity and temperature. positive results were obtained in tests of COVID-19 performed for mask and other animals.
There are no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend to wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that could have touched infected people.
Coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was isolated for the first time of three people with neumonia linked to the group of aggressive respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are located in the coronavirus related to nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies when he comes into contact with jabon, which solves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is well related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's thinking he's got a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis showed that the coronavirus is geneticly grouped with the betacoronavirus gender, its sarbecovirus subgenere (linage B) together with two derivated seeds from the murciel.
At the level of the total genome, it is 96% identical to other coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in amino acids in some parts of the sequences of the genome between pangolines virus and human beings.
Until the date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that the coronavirus of pangolines and the SARS-CoV-2 are at least 92% of the genetic material, which is not enough to demonstrate that pangolines are the intermediate guest.
Virus infection can be temporarily acquired on the basis of symptoms, although at the last instance it is confirmed to the reaction in the stream of polymerase with inverse transcriptase (RRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computerized tomography images.
A study conducted in Wuhan in which the reaction in polymerase chain was compared to computerized tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than the reaction in polymerase chain, even less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images correspond to the processes of other diseases and neumonies.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends "not using computerized tomography as a detection method or as a test of first line for the COVID-19".
The WHO has published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of them published on 17 January.
The test uses the reaction of polymerase chain with inverse transcriptase in real time (RRT-PCR).
The test can be made in blood or respiratory samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours or days.
In general, this test is performed with a nasopharing hisopo, even though a hisopo can also be used for the gargant. Some companies and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these showed that it was sufficiently precise to accept their generalized use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for use of emergency by only certificates.
The characteristic races in computerized radiography and tomography images (TC) of syntomatic persons include insights of asimetric peripheric glass and non-plaural degrees.
The Italian Radiology Society is compiling a international database online of the results obtained in confirmed case images.
As a result of the superposition with other infections such as adenovirus, the diagnosis for images without confirmation by reaction in polymerase chain has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A broad study carried out in China compared the results of computerized torax to the reaction of polymerase chain and showed that, although the diagnosis for images is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests its consideration as a detection tool in the areas affected by epidemia.
Convolutional neuronal networks based on artificial intellectuality were developed to detect virus characteristics in images, both with radiographics and computerized tomographs.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of disease include maintaining a good general personal hygiene, washing the hands, avoiding touching the eyes, the narrow or the mouth with the hands without washing them before, and stearing or tossing on an unexpected pawn and dragging the panel directly in a waste container.
It is recommended that those who could already be infected use a chirurgical mask in public.
It is also recommended to prevent transmission, and many governments have limited or disrespected all non-essential travels from and to countries and areas affected by the broadcasting.
However, the virus has reached the Community propagation phase in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spread within the communities, and some members of the community don't know where or how they have been infected. It is recommended that medical care providers that affect someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use ocular protection.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has generated concerns about privacy, and the International Amnisty and more than 100 other organizations have issued a declaration to deal with limits on this type of monitoring.
Several mobile applications for voluntary use have been implemented or proposed, and on 7 April 2020, more than a dozen of expert groups were working in respectful solutions with privacy, such as using Bluetooth to register a user's neighborhood to other cell phones.
The users then receive a message if they were near contact with someone who gave a positive in the test of the COVID-19. They are making wrong ideas about how to prevent the infection; for example, the nasal lavage and the gargages with bottle injugate are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
The lavage of hands is recommended to prevent the propagation of disease.
CDCs recommend that people lave their hands often with water and jabbe for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when they have their hands swiftly; before eating and after sounding the nose, toser or stornudar.
This is due to that, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with jabon, which disintegrates its protective bottle.
CDCs also recommended use of a defectant for alcohol-based hands with at least 60 % of alcohol in volume when there is no water and jabbon.
The OMS recommends that people avoid touching the eyes, the narrow or the mouth with their hands without having washed them before.
The surfaces can be discontaminated with several solutions (in a minute after the defective exposure in an inoxidable steel surface), including ethanol at 62-71 %, isopropanol at 50-100 %, natrium hypochlorid at 0.1 %, .5 % peroxide peroxide and yod povidone at 0.2-7.5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexid gluconate, are less effective.
CDCs recommend that, if a COVID case is suspicioned or confirmed in an installation, such as a office or guard, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, electronic equipment, such as tablets, tactiles, keyboards, remote controls and automatic boxes that have been used by people.
Health organizations recommend that people cover the mouth and narrow with the flexioned code or with an unexpected panel to toss or stornudar, and that they immediately delay the panel.
It is recommended that those who could be infected use chirurgical maskers, since the use of a mask can limit the volume and distance recovered by the respiratory capets that are spread by speaking, sternudar and toser.
The OMS issued instructions on with and how to use the maskers.
See Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, which is a important source of infection without a suitable hygiene." It is also recommended to use maskers in people who care for someone who could have the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of healthy people only if they run a high risk, for example those who care for a person with COVID-19, although she also recognizes that use of maskers can help people avoid touching the face.
Many countries have started to promote the use of maskers by the public.
In the United States, CDCs recommend use of non-medicic maskers produced with screen. China recommended specifically the use of medical maskers from the healthy members of the public, especially when they are near (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends use of a chirurgical mask to take public transport or to be in competition.
The sane officers in Thailand recommend people to make screen maskers in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia went out to public spaces without using a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that everyone use a mask when being in public spaces to be able to protect and protect others.
The Government of Austria has made use of maskers by all persons who enter into a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use maskers in public.
Thaiwan, who has produced ten million maskers per day since the middle of March 1 April, was the use of maskers by passengers in trains and buses interurban.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of maskers to get out of the free air, while it also recommends the manufacture of housed maskers made to those who can't buy them.
Mascarillas have also been generalized in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
The social distance (also known as physical distance) includes measures to control the infection designed to prevent the propagation of disease by minimising close contact between people.
The methods include quarters, travel restrictions and school closure, jobs, stages, theatres and commercial centres.
People can implement social distance methods by staying in their homes, limiting travels, avoiding competited areas, using health forms that do not include contacts and physically distance from other people.
Many governments now require or recommend social distance in regions affected by the broadcast.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by the Governing Agencies and United States Health Organizations was quickly reduced by 250 persons (if there was no COVID-19 extension in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany held public meetings of more than two persons; older adults and those with diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension and immune systems have a greater risk of suffering of diseases and serious complications, and CDCs recommend that they remain in their homes as far as possible in the areas of the community affected by the brote. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social distance" with "fiscal distance" to declare that the objective is to reduce physical contact while they are maintaining social connections, whether or not at the end of March 2020.
The use of the term "social distance" has affected the assumption that people should adopt a complete social isolation rather than encourage them to keep contact with others with alternative means. Some authorities have published directly on sexual health to use during the pandemy.
They include recommendations to have sexual relations only with a person living with which they do not have virus or symptoms of virus.
The auto-isolation at home was recommended to those who were infected by COVID-19 and those who were suspicious of being infected.
The health agencies have published detailed instructions on the suitable self-isolation. Many governments have made or recommended the autoquartenan of all populations in the areas concerned.
Instructions on more strict autoquartenan were issued for those who belong to high-risk groups.
Persons who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with generalised transmission, are recommended to carry out for 14 days since the last possible exposure.
The strategy to control a broad is containing or suppression and mixing.
Containment is carried out in the first stages of the broadcasting and is aimed at identifying and isolating infected people, as well as to introduce other infection and vaccine control measures to avoid propagating disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the propagation of disease, efforts are transferred to the mixture phase: measures are taken to prevent propagation and mix their effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containing and mixing measures can be taken at the same time.
Reduction reverses extremely measures to be able to return pandemy to the reduction of the basic number of reproduction less than 1. Part of controlling the breach of a infectious disease involves trying to reduce the epidemic pipe, which is known as planning the curve of epidemia.
This reduces the risk of collapsing health services and allows more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the break include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, use of maskers and self-quartenant; Community measures oriented to physical distance, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of massive competition events; the Community commitment to promote the acceptance and participation of these interventions; as well as environmental measures and surfaces; more drastic measures were taken in China when its gravity was evident, for example, the implementation of quarters in all cities and the establishment of strict travel.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures to restrict the propagation of virus.
South Korea has implemented massive detection assessments and quarters located, and has made warnings on the movements of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who decided to carry out a quarantane and impose great wages to those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of maskers and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. The simulations in Great Britain and the United States show that mixing (which reduces the propagation of epidemia but does not keep it) and the elimination (which reveals the growth of pandemy) has great challenges.
Optical mixing policies could reduce the maximum medical attention request in two third parties and deaths at half, but even generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the colapse of health systems.
The elimination can be preferred, but it must be maintained for all the time that the virus is in the human population (or until there is a vaccine available, if it happens first), because, otherwise, the transmission is quickly reactivated when the measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to eliminate pandemy involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medicines approved for COVID-19, but there are efforts to develop them, including testing of existing medicines.
Taking free sale medicines for refrigerated, drinking liquids and relaxing can help aliviate symptoms.
Severity, oxygenotherapy, intravenous liquids and respiratory assistance may be needed.
The use of steroids can decrease the results.
Several compositions previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also indicated that some "traditional households" can alive the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes the increased capacity and the adjustment of medical attention to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a fundamental measure of response to breach.
The ECDC and the Regional Office for Europe of the WHO have directly formulated hospitals and primary medical care services for re-distribution of resources at different levels, including focusing on COVID-19 tests, canceling optional procedures, where possible, separating and isolating positive patients in COVID-19 and increased intensive care capacity through the staff and increased amount of respirators and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case could have been originated (the named zero patient).
The first case known for the new coronavirus can be returned to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei increased gradually.
These were mainly linked to the major market of Huan's marine, which also sold live animals, and a theory is that the virus originated from one of these animals; or, in other words, which had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a series of cases of neurological cause was observed by Dr. Zhang Jixian in the Province Hospital of Hubei, who informed Jianghan's CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors in the Central Hospital of Wuhan warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".

About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
As a result of the pandemy in Europe, many countries in the Schengen space have limited freedom and border controls.
National reactions have included conservation measures, such as quaranthenes (known as the orders of stay at home, repealing orders in the place or limitation) and remaining touchs. On April 2, approximately 300 million people, or approximately 90 per cent of the population, are complied with some type of restriction in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in Philippines, about 59 million people are limited in South Africa and 1300 million people are limited in India.

On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a transportation in Wuhan, the representative of WMS Gauden Galea noted that, although "finishedly it was not a recommendation that the WHO had made," it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it was more concentrated" and said "not held in the history of public health".

The Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom, said that the ESPII should "be to the risk of global propagation, especially to low and medium-sized income countries without solid health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros suggested that " there are no reasons to take measures that are unnecessaryly influenced on trade and international travels" and that "WHO does not recommend to limit trade or movement".

Several administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) were released due to their maintenance of quarrentine efforts in Central China, a sign of disapproval with the response of the political system to breaking in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party, Xi Jin, from the public anger by the cronavirus broadcast.
Some Chinese officers, for example, Zhao Lijian, disapproval an earlier recognition from the beginning of the cronavirus broadcast in Wuhan for conspirative theories on the origin of COVID-19 in the United States or Italy.
The administration of Donald Trump of the U.S. has referred to coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and suggested that "China's censure has overcome a virus that has now become a global pandemy", which was, at the same time, indicated by some critics such as racism and "distrac" of its administration failure to contain disease.
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the Government of the U.S. that described a strategy of communications originating in the National Security Council, and the strategy was quoted as "All on China".
We have been told that we are trying to send this message anyway, including press conferences and apparences in television. "Communication media such as Policy, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have concluded that China's efforts to send help to the countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
The representative of the European Union foreign policy, Josep Borrell, warned that " there is a geopolitical component that includes a fight against propaganda influence and generosity policy."
Borrell also said, "Chinese is aggressively impulsing the message that, in contrast to the United States, is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested that the United States arise their sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reports were sent assistance to these two last countries.
On 3 April, United States sanctions blocked the donation of Jack Ma of 100 000 maskers to Cuba.
The authorities and authorities were also accused of sending aid to other countries to their own country.
And disputes related to maskers between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and between the Czech Republic and Italy, have been reported.
Moreover, Turkey invades hundreds of respirators destinated to Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin provided that the Russian army sends military doctors, special disinfect vehicles and other medical teams to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous high-level policy source that was 80% of Russia's aid was "inutile or shortly used for Italy".
The source accused Russia to undertake a "geopolitical and diplomatic seduction offence".
The President of Lombardia, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio, disapproval the periodic reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin's portfolio, Dmitry Peskov, said that "in offering assistance to colleagues and colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when manufacturers and equipment and medical equipment cover impulse, they can also correspond if necessary."
The planned military exercise of NATO "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest war exercise of NATO since the end of the Friday War, will be made to a decreased scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the exercise of Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it threatens life not only from the United States and the various European countries who participate, but also of the inhabitants of the countries where they operate." The Iranian Government was very affected by the virus, with about two decades of members infected by Parliament, as well as fifty other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, the President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, wrote a public letter to the world leaders to seek assistance, and said that their country has difficulties to combat the breakdown because of the lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States' sanctions against Iran. The broadcast encouraged the need that the United States adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal infant attention, refunded family licence and greater levels of public health funds.
Political analystes have predicted that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's reelecting opportunities in the presidential election of 2020. The diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to pandemy.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine" efforts, after Japan announced that everyone from South Korea will remain in quarantine for two weeks in sites appointed by the Government.
The South Korean society at the beginning was polyarized with regard to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests for Moon's destitution because they considered a wrong management of the broadcasting by the Government, or to praise their response; the pandemy has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentaries have expressed the concern that governments may enable to strengthen their power control.
In Hungary, its Parliament voted in order to allow the Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to govern by decree indefinitely, suspend Parliament and elections and sanctify those who are considered to have distributed information on the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
Coronavirus was charged with several cases of lack of supplies, as a result of the worldwide greatest use of equipment to combat broadcasting, panic-induced purchases and interruptions of logistics and factory operations.
Food and medicines in the United States have published warnings on the lack of medicines and medical equipment due to the largest request of consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
A number of localities also presented purchases impulsed by the panic that left empty stations of essential products, such as food, hygiene paper and embottle water, which caused lack of supplies.
The technology sector has, in particular, been warning about the delays of sending electronic products.
The WHO General Director, Tedros Adhanom, request for personal protection equipment has increased 100 times.
This request generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays from four to six months in the provision of medical articles.
He also caused a lack of personal protection teams worldwide, and the WHO warned that this would be dangerous for healthy workers.
The pandemy offered a new opportunity to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a lack of formula for children in some supermarket and has later been held by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in the north of Italy and the Wuhan region, and the next request for food, no of these areas was affected by the aggressive shortage of food.
The measures in China and Italy against the compulsory and illicit trade of essential products have been successful, and they have avoided a low shortage of food in Europe and Northern America.
The North Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant decrease, but prices could increase, if representatives of the sector.
Food stations were only temporary, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officers released the preservations of green meat to ensure sufficient food of the population.
In Italy there are similar laws that require food producers to maintain reservations for these events.
The damage in the world economy was in China: if a periodistic report of 16 March, China's economy was very affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the Government to stop the development of the virus, and the minorities sold 20.5%.
Since the continental China is an important economic and manufacturer center, the viral fraction has been considered a significant threat to destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economic Intelligence Unit has foretold that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of potential consequences occurs.
In January 2020, some analystes considered that the economic consequences of the epidemia on global growth could exceed those of the SARS broadcast 2002-2004.
A estimate of a expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated a impact of over $300 million on the world supply chains that could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Oil Exporter Organization (OPEC) was "reverse" after a strong fall in oil prices due to the latest request of China.
On 24 February, global value markets fell due to significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside China.
On 27 February, due to increased concerns on the broadcast of coronavirus, several U.S. bursatiles, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average have published their most pronounced falls since 2008, Dow fell 1191 points, the most falling one day from the financial crisis 2007-08.
The three ended the week with less than 10 per cent.
On February 28, Scope Ratings 1992 was aware of the sovereign credit assessment of China, but he kept a negative perspective.
The actions again fell on the basis of fears of the coronavirus, the greatest fall occurred on March 16th.
Many believe that there is a economic recess.
The economicist Mohamed El-Erian adopted the opportune emergency measures of the states and central stages.
Central facilities are repealing faster than they re-reacted to the 2008 financial colapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors because of traveling, the closed public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of governments not to travel to any part of the world.
Consequently, many lines have cancelled flights due to the latest request, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British Regional Line Flybe colapsed.
The impact on the sector of cross-sectors is achieved by a level never previously seen.
Various railway stations and terminals of transborders have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, an important season of travels related to the feriders of the New Year of China.
Several events in which major events were cancelled by national and regional governments, including new Year Festivals, while private companies also closed their tourist tents and attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many tourist events and attractions of the New Moon Year have been closed to avoid massive concentrations, including the Prohibited City of Peking and the traditional festivals of the temples.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year Festival until 10 February, and commanded the majority of the jobs to not reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the BDP and 90% of the exports from the country.
Hong Kong raised its response to the highest infectional disease and declared an emergency, closed the schools until March and canceled its celebrations of New Year. The minorist sector seemed to be affected at the world level, with reductions in the time of attention or temporary closures.
The visits to minorists in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Northern and Middle East minorists experienced a fall of 50 to 60%.
This also caused a fall of 33 to 43% in the peatonal transit to commercial centres in March compared to February.
The operators of the world's commercial centres have introduced additional measures, such as higher hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of purchasers and cancellation of events. A estimate of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession of the pandemy could leave between 14 and 22 million more in a extreme poverty situation in Latin America than those who had remained in that situation without the pandemy.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the nearly 300 million rural workers in China were held in their homes in the provinces of Hubei or captured in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million people lost their employment and requested governmental assistance.
The coronavirus break could cost 47 million employment in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, it is estimated by the Bank of the Federal Reserve of San Luis. The limitation in India has left decades of millions of Indian employees (receiving daily salaries) unemployed. 44% of the Canadian homes have experienced some kind of unemployment. About 900 000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since they have eat the limitation to the middle of March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers requested provisions for temporary unemployment and 1 million British workers requested a universal credit plan, and nearly a half million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes supported by the Government, known as Kurz Work, for their workers.
The German short-term work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
Scene arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by pandemy, which affected the operations of the organizations and the individuals, both employed and independent, worldwide.
Cultural and arts organizations have tried to carry out their mission (frequently financed with public funds) to provide access to the community to cultural heritage, to maintain the security of their employees and the public and to support artists when possible.
For March 2020, the museums, libraries, spectacle places and other cultural institutions have been closed indefinitely, and their exposures, events and spectacles have been cancelled or post-termed.
In response, there have been great efforts to provide alternative services to digital platforms. Another recent consequence and that increases to a accelerated rate of disease is the cancellation of religious services. important sport events and other social events, such as music and concerts, technology conferences and mode defiles.
The cinematographic industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the celebrations of Santa Week in Rome, which have been held during the last week of the Christian penitentiary season of the Quaresma.
Many dioceses have recommended that elderly Christians stay in their homes instead of attending the mistake on Sundays; some churches offered religious services to radio, transmission live by Internet or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
After the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close their churches and captures and with the Plaza of San Pedro empty of Christian peregrins, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mixtures, synagogues, temples and gurdwars.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday's pleasures in the areas affected by the broadcast and then closed the sanctuaries, while Saudi Arabia held the entrance of strangers and its residents to the sacred places in La Meca and Medina.
Pandemy has caused the most significant change in the world sports calendar since the Second World War.
The majority of the important sport events were canceled or post-parted, among them, the EUFA Campeons Liga 2019-20, the Premier League 2019-20, the EUFA Euro 2020, the NBA season 2019-20 and the NHL season 2019-20.
The broadcast interrupted the plans of the Olympics Games 2020, which originally were planned to start at the end of July; the International Olympical Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "reprogramed for a date after 2020 but not after the summer of 2021". The casinos and other games in the world were closed and online poker tours were postered or cancelled.
This caused many apostates to recycle on the Internet, many online staff sites reported significant increases in their rate of new inscriptions. The entertainment industry was also affected, several musical groups suspended or canceled concert turns.
Many big teatres, such as Broadway, also suspended all spectacles.
Some artists have explored ways of continuing to produce and maintain their work on the Internet as an alternative to the traditional live spectacle, such as live transmissions of concerts or the creation of "festivales" on the Internet, so that artists interpret, distribute or distribute their work.
Online, many web memes were distributed on the coronavirus, since many retreat humor and distraction in the middle of the uncertainty.
Since the break of the COVID-19, there has been an increased increase in the population, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descendants, and to people in the areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the region of Asia and the region of Asia, have been observed.
February reports (when most of the cases were still limited to China) have documented racised feelings in several groups around the world that expressed that Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered a righteous reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have informed discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support both on the Internet and outside.
After the advancement of the broadcast towards new countries where the situation is critical, the Italian people, the first European country who experienced a serious broadcast of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was a trend in Twitter.
Chinese, as well as other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have informed greater levels of racist insults, as well as aggressions.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized by referring to the coronavirus as the "Chine virus", a term which many criticians considered racist and antichine.
manifestants in Ukraine attacked buses transporting to Ukrainian and foreign evacuated from Wuhan to New Sanzhary.
There are reports, students from North-East India, who have a border with China, and who are studying in the main Indian cities, have suffered accusation in relation to the break of coronavirus.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in Bengala O'al, Dilip Ghosh, expressed that the Chinese had destroyed the nature and "that God was vengeed from them".
China's consulat in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said that they were "errorists". In China, they increased xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents as a result of pandemy, and it was described to strangers as "foreign base" and intended for "research".
Many newspapers with payment walls have removed them for parts or all of their covering of coronavirus.
Many scientist editors published scientific articles related to the broad with open access.
Some scientists chose to make their results quickly on pre-print servers like bioRxiv.

The tests of respiratory disease for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2-virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those who detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of virus in the samples is confirmed at the test of reaction in the stream of polymerase with inverse transcriptase, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnostics and for monitoring the population.
The tests of antibodies show how many people have had the disease, including those who had too light symptoms as to inform them or who were asymptomatic.
From the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of disease and the collective immunity level in the population can be determined.
Because of the limited tests, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of virus in its population.
On 23 March, no country had proved more than 3% of its population, and there are large changes in the number of tests carried out in the different countries.
It is also implied that this variability is significantly affecting the letality rates for reported cases, which are probably very overestimated in some countries.
A ≥ of the reaction of polymerase with inverse transcriptase in real time (RRT-PCR), the test can be made in respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasofaring hysops or spot samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours until two days.
The test of reaction of polymerase chain with inverse transcriptase performed with pharmaceutical hysopaths is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear in the garment, but it is still multiplying in the lungs.
In persons infected to which the test is performed in the second week, as alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory roads through suction category, or the material that is exposed to toser (sputo).
One of the first tests of reaction of polymerase chain was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the reverse reaction of polymerase with real time transcriptase (RRT-PCR), and consisted of the base of the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the reaction of the clinical polymerase (PowerChek Coronavirus).
Looking for the gene "E" by all betacoronavirus and the RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies in obtaining the use of emergency of the National Medical Products of China from a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the reaction of polymerase chain. In the United States, the Centres for Control and Prevention of Disasters (CDC) distribute their diagnostic reaction panel in the stream of polymerase with actual transcriptase in real time for the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health sites through the International Reagent Ressource.
One of the three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits generated incomplete results due to defective reactions, and an attack on testing in the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, in average, less than 100 samples per day during the entire February of 2020.
The confidentiality of the tests used by two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only since then it was permitted that state and local tests begin to be performed.
Food and medicines approved the test under the authorisation of the use of emergency, and the United States trade ́s tests began to be tested at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the nationality of tests for COVID-19 based on the reaction of polymerase with inverse transcriptase.
Similarly, on 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics provided evidence for COVID-19 at national level.
No limits were stated in the quantity; the collection of spectrums and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDCs.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Medical Observering. On 12 March 2020, it was informed that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA for a test that could be carried out within a period of 3.5 hours in large volume, which allowed a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the authorisation for emergency use for Abbott Laboratories for a test in the M 2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received the same authorisation for the FDA's use of emergency for a test that remains about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses the isotermic amplification technology of nuclear acids instead of the reaction in polymerase chain.
Since this does not repeat a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are approximately 18 000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott expects to increase production to perform 50 000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is developing that uses a monoclonal antibodies that is specifically a protein of the nucleocapside (proteine N) of the new coronavirus, with the hope that it can provide results within a period of 15 to 20 minutes as a quick test for influenza.
In March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that "torax radiografies have little diagnostic value in the first stages, while the results of the TC [computated tomography] can be obtained even before the symptoms appear."
The typical characteristics in the TC include bilateral multilateral opacities in delighted glass with periferic, asimetric and later distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domination, prevention pattern and consolidation is developed.
A study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemy, in which the reaction in the chain of polymerase with computerized tomography was compared, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than the reaction in polymerase chain, even less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and neumonies.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends "not using computerized tomography as a detection method or as a test of first line to make the COVID-19". Since March 2020, CDCs recommend the reaction in the stream of polymerase as a initial examination.
Part of the immune system reaction to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect the infection in persons approximately from the 7 days after the symptoms appearance, to determine immunity and the population's monitoring. Analysis in centrals or tests at the point of attention can be performed.
High performance systems in many clinical activities can perform these analyses, but their ability will depend on the rate of production of each system.
For central analysis, one periferic blood species is usually used, although serious spectrums can be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, one type of blood is generally obtained by a penalty in the skin.
On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 persons who provided the agency an information as appropriate and therefore now can distribute its antibodies tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an authorisation of emergency use. On the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received the approval of Europe for their test kits, which could detect IgG and IgA antibodies against virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is of several hundreds of samples during the hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional test of reaction in the viral RNA polymerase.
At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom discovered that no of the anti-corps test kits that he bought was enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a programme in which suspicious patients can remain in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a tube for species", the patient splits in the tube, sends it and gets a result for a short time. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot programme to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient infections others if he goes to the hospital or the need to disinfeke an ambulance if one is used. In tests in driver-through centres for COVID-19 of suspicious cases, a health professional takes with appropriate precautions.
Drive-through centres have helped South Korea to make some of the fastest and more tests of any country. In Germany, the National Health Health Security National Association said on 2 March that it had a capacity for approximately 12 000 tests per day in the ambulatory environment and that tests had been performed at 10 700 people on the previous week.
Health insurance takes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
The President of the Institute Robert Koch, Germany has a general capacity to make 160 000 tests per week.
On March 19, tests were offered through the driver-through system in several large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only the positive results were informed.
One first investigation of Others showed that at the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples were analysed, even including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9 %) were made positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers of the Instituto Technion and Hospital Rambam were developed and tested a method to analyze samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping the samples and only to analyze if the combinated sample results were positive. On 5 February 2020, Wuhan, the BGI was able to process more than 10 000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was supervised by the BGI funder, Wang Jian, and that it spent 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47% greater and that the relevant cost to address the Quarrentine would have duplicated without this ability to test.
After Wuhan's Property, Huo-Yan was immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianýn, Pekín and Shanghai, in a total of 12 towns in China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Multiple open source designs were implemented by origami analysis that allow to evaluate up to 1122 patients samples for COVID19 using only 93 analysis. These balanced designs can be used in small areas without need to use liquid manipulation robots.
For March, lack and insufficient amounts of reactive affected massive tests in the European Union and the United States.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involved heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genes to make more tests. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now making more tests of coronavirus detection in their population than any other country, and was encountered to increase the level of tests to cover most of the population.
This has been achieved through the combination of driver-through capacity and the purchase of a massive production at the population of Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" detections in China).
Constructed in 14 days, the Property has the ability to perform tens of thousands of reaction tests in the stream of polymerase with inverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Different forms of tests were developed with different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for manufacturing kits sent to low income countries that had no resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the Protocol developed by the United States Control and Prevention Centres was not available until 28 January, which was delayed by the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the broadcasting, and these countries and women could not provide enough kits to satisfy the request and recommendations of health experts on tests.
In contrast, experts say that the largeness of South Korea's tests helped to reduce the propagation of the new coronavirus.
The South Korean Government has achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private sectors, within several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested an increase in test programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemy. The high request for tests due to the extensive spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests in the United States private tests, and chemical and chemical reaction supplies were delayed.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the precision of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; then the Government removed the burocratic barriers that had avoided private tests. Spain bought test kits to the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained impressive results.
The company explained that the wrong results could be due to the wrong collection of samples or the wrong use of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said that it would retreat the kits that dropped wrong results and replace them by a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought to China gave wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits to China which resulted in implicit.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested to throw them into Danube. Ateş Kara, of the Turkish Health Ministry, said that the evidence kits that Turkey bought to China had a "high error rate" and not "used". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits to China, but at the beginning of April 2020 announced that they did not serve.
The realization of tests, supplemented by the quarantine of those who received positive results, and the identification of the people with whom they had contacted those who gave positive in SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers who work in the Italian city of Vo, the place where the first death occurred by COVID-19 in Italy, performed two trials throughout the population of about 3400 people, with about 10 days of divergence.
Approximately half of the people who received positive results had no symptoms, and all the cases detected were seen in quarantine.
With the limitation of tours in the municipality, this has completely eliminated the new infections.
With intensive contact trace, travel restrictions from outside, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus 2020 pandemy in Singapore is much slower than in other developed countries, but they have not applied extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and minorist institutions.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore eats to recommend residents who stayed in their homes, but schools opened again after the feast of 23 March.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemy with the intensive stream of contacts, travel restrictions from outside, tests and quarters, but with less strict limitations such as Iceland and South Korea.
It is a statistical study, countries who have made more evidence, in relation to the number of deaths, have letality rates for cases much lower, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who have only light symptoms or who have no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries who have no ability to perform tests and who have national experiences limited in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to some of the 16 WHO references to test confirmation.
From the 16 references, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Africa.
In the following table, the "Positive as % of tests" column is affected by the country's policy for testing.
A country that only makes evidence in the hospitals will have a higher number of proofs as % of tests than a country that performs evidence in all citizens, whether or not, the other issues are equal.
The lavage of hands, also known as hygiene of hands, is the action to wash hands with a view to eliminating suicide, fat, micros or other undetermined substances.
The lavage of hands with jabon constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day predicts the propagation of many diseases, such as diarrea and cold, which are transmitted by fecal oral.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or common refrigeration, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, narrow or mouth (e.g. mucosa membranes).
The five critical moments during the day where it is important to wash the hands with jabbon include: before and after defect, after having taken a child's school or changing the boys, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a food or manipulating crude, fished or bird meat.
If there is no water or jabone, hands can be washed with census. The World Health Organization recommends to wash the hands:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a person.
After changing paints or guarding a kid who used the bathroom.
After the nose sounds, toss or stornout.
After playing animals, food for animals or animal waste.
The medical hygiene of hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
The washing of hands before taking medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the propagation of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand waste is to remove patogens (bacteria, virus or other microscopes) and chemical substances that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand waste has many benefits for health, including minimising the propagation of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing diarrea infectional causes; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the rate of infant mortality in the births at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that improvements in hand washing practices can generate small improvements in growth in children under five years.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoea diseases can be reduced by the introduction of simple changes in behaviour, such as washing hands with jabon.
This simple action can reduce almost 50% the rate of mortality for these diseases.
The interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhee episodes in a third part approximately, and this is similar to providing potential water in low income areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be related to the lavage of hands with jabon. The lavage of hands with jabon is the most efficient and economic way to prevent adequate diarrhoea and respiratory infections, such as automatic behaviour adopted in the homes, schools and communities of the world.
Nemonia, an important aggressive respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children less than five years, and life is covered by an estimated amount of 1.8 million children per year.
The diarrhoea and the neumonium together represent almost 3.5 million infant deaths per year.
UNICEF, converting hand waste with jabbon before eating and after using the bathroom in a driving habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce almost half deaths by diarrhoea and a quarter of deaths for awake respiratory infections.
In general, hand waste is integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, health and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against impetition, which is transmitted to ≥ direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that its frequent performance can cause skin damage due to skin sequence.
There is a Danish study conducted in 2012, the hand washing can cause a skin affection that causes picazion and makes the skin return scamously known as the eschema of hands or dermatitis of hands, which is especially frequent in healthy workers.
The lavage of too frequent hands is also considered one of the symptoms of the compulsive disturbance (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when the hand washing with jabon is important to reduce the oral-feal transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (oriner, defecter), after taking a child's school (switching bottles), before feeding a child, before eating and before/ after preparing a food or manipulating crude, fished or bird meat.
Other times where a proper hand washing technology should be practiced to prevent the transmission of diseases includes before and after treatment of a court or an injury; after heating, tossing or sounding the narrow; after touching animal residues or manipulating animals; and after toughing.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with jabon.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries carried out in 2015 concluded that 38.7% of the families practiced in average hands with jabon. In 2014 a study indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97%; the United States was nearly half with 77%; and China had the lowest rate with 23%. Currently, there are several methods for the change of behaviour, to increase the adoption of the habit to wash hands with jabbon at critical times. The lavage of hands in the group of children in the school at some times of the day is a choice in developing countries to incorporate hands in the behavior of children.
The "San’a essence care programme" implemented by the Philippines Education Department is an example of a measured action to promote the health and education of children.
Two times per year, as well as washing the hands with jabon every day, every day capturing the teeth with fluorure, are the basis of this national programme.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The elimination of micros from the skin improves by adding to jabon or detergent water.
The main action of jabons and detergents is to reduce the barriers for solution and to increase solvency.
Only water results ineffective to keep the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic material, are not easily solved in water.
However, a reasonable fluid of water facilitates the ease.
The solid jabbin, due to its reusable nature, may contain therms purchased in previous uses.
Some studies analyzing the transfer of solid contaminated jabbons concluded that transfer is low, since the spuls are injured.
Yet, CDCs say "is preferable for liquid jabbin with controls for dispensation that do not involve using their hands".
Anti-bacterian jabons have been intensely promoted for a conscious health public.
Currently, there are no evidence that show that use of the recommended desinfektors or antiseptics preserves antibiotics by nature.
However, anti-bacterian jabons contain common anti-bacterian agents, such as triclosan, who have a list of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if anti-bacterian jabons do not preserve antibiotic ceps, they could not be as effective as promoted.
Besides the surface agent and protects the skin, sophisticated formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, asylum, milk acid) as well as the pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobian activity and more aconditioning for skin (alie true, vitamins, mentols, vegetable extractes). A exhaustive analysis of the Public Health School of the University of Oregon indicated that common jabons are as effective as the antibacterian jabons for the consumer containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate hands.
The warm water is not enough to wash the hands.
There is much faster to corporate temperature (37 °C).
However, the tissue water is more effective than the cold jabonous water to remove the natural oil that cover the ground and theeries.
However, contrary to popular faith, scientist studies have shown that use of tissue water does not affect the reduction of microbian load in hands.
A desinfektor for hands or antiseptical for hands is a non-water agent for the hygiene of hands.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the 20th century, the hygiene agents of the hands without water and with alcohol to float (also known as a solution for hands based on alcohol to float, antiseptic solution for hands to float or disinfekting for hands) began to buy popularity.
The majority is based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with an exposing agent as carbon (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a humidant like glucerin in a liquid, or spume for easily use, and to reduce the reuse effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted peroxide increases the antimicrobian activity. Desinfectants for hands containing between 60 and 95% of alcohol at least eliminate the heatings effectively.
Alcohol-based disinfectants eliminate theeries, resistant theeries to several medicines (SARM and ERV), from tuberculosis and some virus (HIV, herpes, VSR, renovirus, vaccination, influenza and hepatitis) and hungs.
Alcohol-based discomfectants containing 70 % of alcohol eliminate 99.97 % (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to the reduction of 35 decibels) of the tears in the hands of 30 seconds after the application and 99.99 % to 99.99 % (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) from the hands 1 minute after the application.
Desinfektors for alcohol-based hands are almost ineffective against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most frequent cause of the contagious gastroenteritis. A sufficient solution should be used for antiseptical hands or based alcohol to float, such as to humid or cover both hands completely.
The palm and the back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers, are floured for about 30 seconds until the liquid, the smoke or the gel are dried.
The finger points should also be washed well, frot them in both hands. The United States Control and Prevention Centres recommend the lavage of hands before the disinfektors for hands to flee, especially when the hands are roughly swimming.
The increased use of these agents is based on their use facility and on the rapid elimination activity of microscope; however, they should not be used as a substitution of the appropriate lavate with the hands unless there is no water or jabon.
Frequent use of deinfektors for hands based on alcohol may cause the skin to drop, unless emolients or added to the skin to the formula.
The sequence effect of alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glucerin or other emolients to the formula.
In clinical trials, defectants for alcohol based on emolients caused an irritation and sequence of skin to be considered less than antimicrobian jabons or detergents.
Alergic dermatitis by contact, urticaria syndrome by contact or hyper-eyeability for alcohol or additives present in the solutions for alcohol-based hands for floating are very few.
The smallest tendency to provoke irritant dermatitis by contact resulted in attractive comparison with water and jabon waste.
Despite their efficiency, non-water agents do not remove the organic material from their hands, but simply desinfect them.
For this reason, hand-infectants are not as effective as water and jabon to prevent the propagation of many patogens, since patogens still remain in their hands.
The efficiency of deinfectants for hands without alcohol depends largely on ingredients and the formula, also historically, has been much less than the alcohol and alcohol-based solutions to float.
Recently, the formulas used for benzalconium chloride have a persistent and cumulative antimicrobian activity after application, in contrast to alcohol, whose efficiency decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low income communities cannot buy jabon and use in exchange of census or land.
The census or the earth can be more efficient than the water alone, but less effective than the jabone.
An anxiety is that, if the land or the census are contaminated with micrormos, this can increase the propagation of diseases rather than reduce it.
Like the jabon, the census is also a desinfectant agent, because, in contact with water, forms a alcaline solution.
The WMS recommended use of census or sand as an alternative to the jabon when there is no jabon.
The right hand waste technology recommended by the United States Control and Prevention Centres to prevent the transmission of diseases includes the following steps:
Moving hands with thick or cold water.
The flowing water is recommended because water recipients can be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to be no difference.
Flip the hands to shape spume with a generous quantity of jabbon, including the hands' backs, between the fingers and below the eggs.
The jabone removes the chemicals from the skin, and the studies indicate that people lay their hands less smallly when they use jabone than when they use water alone.
Return for at least 20 seconds.
Restressing creates fraction, which helps to remove the skin heatings, and restrict for longer periods removes more heat.
Play well with running water.
Putting on a recipient can return to contaminate your hands.
Drop with a toilet or leave the air dry.
Humed and mixed hands are again contaminated with easierness. The parts that are more frequently live are powder, munch, areas between the fingers and below the uves
The artificial eggs and the smalt of discashed eggs can be a micro-scale.
Commonly, humid loosing is recommended to avoid rejection of hands; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
A number of economic options can be used to facilitate the lavage of hands when there is no flowing water or jabbon, for example, seeing water from a covered bidon or a calabas with suitable or use of census, if necessary in developing countries. In the cases where there is a limited water supply (as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to protect water, such as "case griffs" and other economic options.
A cash griff is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jara of a soga and a pawn with the foot to see a small quantity of water on the hands and a jabbon on the bar.
The effective drought of hands is a essential part of the hygiene process of hands, but there is a certain debate on the way of more effective drying in public bathrooms.
Each time, research indicates that paper toilets are much more hygiene than hand-secters that are located in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the Westminster University, London, conducted a study, patrocinated by the European Tisue Symposium Paper Towels Industrial Association, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper toiletes, warm air-suckers and the more modern air-flower hand-suckers.
After washing and drying hands with the heat air dropper, it was detected that the total amount of halts increased, in average, a 194 per cent in the fingers and a 254 per cent in the palms.
The drying with the air flower resulted in an average increase in the total amount of halts by 42 % in the fingers and 15 % in the palms.
After washing and drying the hands with a paper toilet, the total amount of materials reduced, in average, a 76 per cent in the fingers and a 77 per cent in the palms. The scientists also performed tests to determine whether there was a crushed contamination of other bathroom users and bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air flower, which surfaces air from the unit to speed, is: 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), has been able to browse the micros of the hands and the unit and, possibly, to contaminate other bathroom users and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a warm air dropper spread the micros up to 0.25 metres away from the dryer.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product and Environment, different methods of drought were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the summary of equipment after the hand drought:
There are many manufacturers of different hand droppers, and hand droppers have been compared to the dry with paper toilets.
To wash the hands with disinfectant toalites for hands is an alternative during the travels, when there is no water or jabon.
The deinfectant for hands of alcohol should contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The lavage of the doctors’ hands became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its efficiency (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide comments to remind members of the hospital staff who lay their hands when they live.
A study tested a decrease of infection rates with its use.
The lavage of the hands of the doctors is made at least for 15 seconds, with a quantity of water and jabbin or ice to form spume and restrict all parts of the hands.
Hands should be stretched together by interringing their fingers.
If there are remains below the eggs, a wheel pill can be used to remove them.
Since heatings can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to hurt them well and dry them with a toilet.
After drying, the paper toilet should be used to close the water (and open any output door if necessary).
This prevents the hands to be contaminated again by those surfaces.
The purpose of washing hands in the medical care environment is to remove the pathogens ("Germen") and avoid transmitting them.
See New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of hand washing still exists at inacceptable levels in most of the medical environments, where many doctors and farmers usually are obliged to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit micros.
A study showed that the correct lavage of hands and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood torrent infections related to category by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a sheet in which the hand waste and the normal hand fraction in the medical care sectors.
The preliminar version of the guide for the organization’s hand hygiene can also be found on its website so that the public can make comments.
Whitby and others conducted a relevant review.
Trade devices may measure and verify the hygiene of the hands, if the demonstration of regulatory compliance is repeated.
The World Health Organization has "five moments" for the lavage of hands:
after the exposure to blood or body liquids
before an aseptical work, and
after attending patients. The aggregation of antiseptical chemicals in the jabon (medicinales) or "antibacterian) gives you the possibility of elimination to the hand washing agent.
This elimination may be necessary before a surgery or in environments where the antibiotic resistant organisms are very often. To wash the hands before a surgery operation, it is necessary to count with a griff that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, a little of chlorhexidine or yodo for the lavade, sterilized toals to dry hands after the lavade, a sterilized capsule to break up and another sterilized instrument to wash below the eggs.
All the joyes must be removed.
This procedure repeats to wash the hands and breasts to the coal, generally, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When he is injured, the water of the foregrounds should be avoided to return to the hands.
After the washing, the hands are dried with a sterilized bottle and a surgery bath is placed.
To reduce the spread of heatings, it is better to wash hands or to use an antiseptic for hands before and after taking attention to people.
In order to control the infections caused by stafilococs in hospitals, it was checked that the greatest benefit of hand-heat is in the first 20% of the lavage and that the hygiene frequency increases more than 35%.
The lavage with common jabbon results more than triple infections transmitted to food compared to the lavage with antibacterian jabbin. When comparing hand washing with a alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterian jabbon for a average of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that the frozen with alcohol reduced 26% more the contamination of antibacteria than the antibacterian jabbin.
However, water and jabon are more effective to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and the Clostridium difficult spheres of the hands than defectants for alcohol-based hands. Interactions to improve hygiene of hands in health care centres can include staff on hand washing, increase the defectiveness of hands based on alcohol and oral memories to staff.
It is necessary to further investigate what of these interventions are the most effective in the different health care areas.
In developing countries it is considered that the lavage of hands with jabon is an economic and fundamental tool to achieve good health and even good food.
However, the lack of a reliable water supply, jabons or installations to wash their hands in the homes, schools and workplaces, makes it a challenge to achieve universal weapons of hand washing.
For example, in most of the rural areas in Africa, there are very few griffs to wash hands near public or private portrets, although there are economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be the result of stuck habits and not of the lack of jabon or water.
Promotion of hand washing with jabon can affect political decisions, increase consciousness on the benefits of hand waste and cause a long-term change of behaviour in the population.
In order to work effectively, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that Community approaches are effective to increase the lavage of hands in the PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand waste at schools is UNICEF's "Tree stars" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students lave their hands with jabon, including hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can pass from one a, finally, three stars.
Construction of hand washing stations can be part of the campaigns for promoting hand waste which are carried forward to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Day of the Lavado of Manus is another example of consciousness campaign that is trying to make a change in behaviour. As a result of the coronavirus pandemy 2019-2020, UNICEF stimulated the creation of an emoji for hand washed.
A few studies have considered the general rentality of hand waste in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting the lavage of hands with jabon is considered more effective than other water and health interventions.
The importance of the lavage of hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who just were born or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognised by the middle of the 20th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, "the founder of modern heritage".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unappreciably called Miasmas.
In the 1980 decade, the broadcasts of diseases transmitted by food and health care infections led to the United States Control and Prevention Centres to promote hygiene of hands more actively as an important way to prevent the propagation of infections.
In 2009 and COVID-19 pandemy, in 2020, made more conscious about the importance of washing hands with jabon to protect them from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, cards were packed with "right techniques to wash their hands" with the lavabs of public bathrooms and the bathrooms of office and port buildings.
The phrase "laving your hands" is a statement that you don't want to take care of anything or to guard the complexity of something.
He has its origin in the Bible passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but has become a much widespread term of use in some English communities.
In Macbeth of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth starts to wash her hands in a compulsive way in an attempt to spend a imaginary little bit, which represents her consciousness of guilty about the crimes he had committed and who had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been checked that, after remembering or reflecting non-ethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to appreciate the elements for hand washing.
Furthermore, those who have allowed themselves to wash their hands after such reflection have less likely to be involved in other compensatory actions, such as a voluntary.
Religious religions recommend the lavage of hands for hygiene and sim ́pic purposes. The lavage of symbiotic hands, with water, but without jabon, form part of the lavage of ritual hands in many religions, such as raiism, hinduism, tavila and netilat yadayim in the Jewishism, lavatorium in the Christianity and wud in the islam. Religions also recommend the lavage of hygiene hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Jewishism and Islam force themselves to wash their hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sisism, Jewishism and Islam obligated to wash their hands before and after each food.
Risk controls at work at COVID-19
The risk controls at the workplace in the COVID-19 refer to the implementation of hygiene and occupational safety methods in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate risk controls on the job site and the job and are based on a risk assessment of the exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers that can be intended to cope with COVID-19.
The security and employment health (OSHA) of the United States, work with less exposure risks have minimum working contact with the public and working partners, for which are advised measures to prevent basic infections, including hand waste, the recommendation for workers to stay home if they are, respiratory hygiene standards and the maintenance of a routine of deficit and defect of the work environment.
Works with average exposure risk include those in which the common or nearby contact with persons that are not known or suspicious of COVID-19, but which could be infected by the existing Community transmission or by a international trip.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as at schools, work environments with a lot of concentration of people and some large-scale minority sales environments.
The risk controls for this group, as well as the measures for the prevention of basic infections, include ventilation with high-scale air filters, protective and individual protection equipment available if there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that workers of health care and funeral services, exposed to people who are known or suspicioned that they have COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases very highly if they are able to generate soles in persons who are known or suspicious that they have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these people.
Adequate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, and individual protection equipment suitable for work activity.
COVID-19 broadcasts may have several consequences on the workplace.
Workers may miss the job for their own, because they have to care for others or fear for the possible exposure.
Trade patrons may change both in respect of what goods are requested and the purchasing means of such goods (e.g. buying in hours that are not picked, by means of a home or a window from the car).
Finally, the sending of articles from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. A preparation plan and response to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
Plans address the risk levels related to various work sites and work activities, including exposure sources, risk factors from home and Community environments and individual workers' risk factors, such as chronic medical diseases.
They also describe the controls necessary to cope with those risks and contingency plans for breakdowns.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
Among the objectives of the response to a broadcast, it includes reduction of the transfer between staff members, protection of persons with greater risk of suffering of adverse health complications, maintenance of commercial operations and minimising the adverse effects on other of their supply chains.
The severity of disease in the community where the company is affected by the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a broadly used framework for hygiene and occupational safety to classify risk controls is their efficiency.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be removed, the most effective controls are the engineering controls followed by the administrators and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve issuing employees of the risks related to work without repealing the behavior of workers and may be the most profitable solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in the policies or working procedures that react to worker or employer's action.
Individual protection equipment are considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but they can help prevent certain exhibitions.
All types of individual protection equipment should be selected depending on the risk of the worker, as appropriate (e.g. respirators), properly and systemically used, frequently revised, received maintenance, replaced if necessary and removed, stored and rejected correctly to not contaminate.
The health and employment security (OSHA) of the United States is held, work with less exposure risks have minimum working contact with the public and the workers.
The measures for the prevention of basic infections recommended for all workplaces include the lavage of deep and frequency hands, the recommendation for workers to stay home if they are, the standards of respiratory hygiene that cover the toser and storndrag, the provision of paper paints and containers for waste, the preparation for telework or the scaled turns, if necessary, the refusal to workers to use tools and equipment and the maintenance of a routine and uninfection of the work environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who can be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others at work.
The Centres for Control and Prevention of Sickness (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of aggressive respiratory diseases remain in their homes until they stop having fever, fever signs and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medicines to refresh the symptoms or reduce the fever; that the licence policy for disease is flexible and allow employees to stay home to care for a family, and that employees know these policies.
The OSHA shall include the working with average exposure risks include those who repeat frequent or nearly six feet (1.8 m) with persons who do not know or doubt that they have COVID-19, but who could have been affected by SARS-CoV-2 due to the Community transmission of the time around the location of the company, or because the person has recently made a international journey to a place with a generalized transfer of COVID-19.
These include employees who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, work areas with a lot of concentration of persons and some smaller sales environments. Engineering controls for this group and higher risk groups include the installation of high-scale air filters, the increase in the ventilation rate, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic protection facilities and the establishment of a window for care service that the customer may not be able to ask from the car. Administrative controls for this group and the higher risk groups include the installation of high-level air filters, the increase of the rate of workers staying in the house, the installation of physical barriers, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plasts, and the establishment of a screening a window for the use of an attention to the client in order that the customer may be able to request from the car. The administrative controls for this group and the highest risk group include the recommendation of higher risks to recommend the employeers who remain in the employment, the resources and the ensurgery and the benefits of the financees of the financers and the financees financees , financer financers and the financers financers financers , financers financers , , , financers financers , , financ , , financ , financ financ , , financ financ , financ financ , , financ financ , , , financ financ , , , financ , , financ financ , financ financ , , financ , , financ financ , , financ , , , , , , financ , , financ , , , , , , , , , , financ , , , , , , financ , , , , , , financ , , , , , , financ , , financ financ , financ financ , , , , , , , , , , financ financ financ , , , , , financ , , , , , , , , , , , , financ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ` , , , , , , , , ` , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ` , ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` `
Workers of this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person is held in a plane, the appropriate controls to protect the workers and other passengers include separating the person from others at a distance of 6 feet, designing a member of the group to attract the person and offering a mask to the person or requesting to cover the mouth and the nose with paper paints when he touches or goes.
The cabin tripulation must use unexpected chirurgical guins to reach a passenger or to play body liquids or surfaces possiblely contaminated and, perhaps, individual protection equipment if the passenger has fever, your persistent or difficulty to breathe.
In the case of commercial navigation, such as passenger crossings and other ships, risk controls include traveling by disease, self-isolation and immediate information to the medical centre on board if someone presents fever or other symptoms while he is on board.
In the case of schools and children's care centres, the CDCs recommend the closure at short term to guard or disinfect whether a person infected was in the school building, independent of the Community transmission.
When the Community transmission is minimum or moderate, social distance strategy can be implemented, such as cancellation of excursions, assemblies and other massive meetings, such as physical or core education classs or foods in the eating, increased space between pupils, scaled income and output times, limited visits that are not essential and used a separate place for the health room for children with gripal symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission in the local community, as well as social distance strategy, it can be considered to extend the cancellation of classes. For the staff of the police forces conducting daily routine activities, CDCs consider that the immediate risk for health is low.
Police force officers are recommended to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspects of COVID-19 that follow the same patterns as medical emergency technicians, including the use of personal protection equipment.
If there is a close contact during a arrest, the workers must defect and defect their workshop and their equipment with a sole or household toilet before they return to use them and follow the standard operational procedure for the content and desire of the personal protection equipment and the content and washing of the clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgue workers are within high or very high risk of exposure.
Among high exposure risk works are those of delivery, support, and medical transport workers exposed to patients with confirmed diagnostics or suspects of COVID-19.
These become very high exposure risk works if workers perform solar generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnostics or suspects of COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some processes of generation of sole are induction, induction procedures, broncopics, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive samples.
High exhibition risk jobs include those in which workers are involved in preparing COVID-19 and who were suspicioned that they could have it at the time of death; these are a very high exposure risk in case of autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnostic or suspects of COVID-19, even when they are carried out in the process of generation of soles.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure can be added in some medical and morgues environments.
The samples should be manipulated by taking precautions on Biosecurity level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients incoming are separated into different waiting rooms depending on whether or not they can have COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protection equipment, OSHA recommends the use of maskers for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet of those who have been affected or are suspicioned that they have been contagiated with SARS-CoV-2 and those who perform processes of generation of sole.
In the United States, N95 respirators should be used with NIOSH or higher filter maskers in the context of a written complete respiratory programme, including adjustment tests, adjustments and medical examinations.
Other types of maskers can burn greater protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of protectors monos, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body flows.
WHO only recommends the use of a chirurgical mask for the incoming patient classification staff.
For those who take respiratory samples of patients with COVID-19, they take attention or transport them without performing solar generation procedures, the WHO recommends the use of chirurgical, birds or face protector, bathroom and gains.
If a process of generation of soles is carried out, the chirurgical masker should be replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the supply of personal protection equipment is insufficient, the WHO recommends to minimize the need to use them, replace them by telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, the limitation of income permission to the room of a patient with COVID-19 only to those involved in their direct attention, the use of the same mask without recovering it while a number of patients with the same diagnostic, monitoring and coordination of the personal protection equipment chain and degrading the use of maskers by asymptomatic people.

ASUNT: [Covid-19] Align the load and prepare us for the future
EXPIRY DATE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, coordinated universal time
LICEN: CC0: No rights reserved
This month, we are in natural circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic shows our human interconnection at global level and our responsibility to each other.
The challenges presented have no responsibility, but we know that our best response is radical in empathy, cooperation and the global Community building that correspond to the nuclear of this organization.
The companionship and anxiety we have seen among all our companions in email messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible people we have the happiness of working with.
I couldn't feel more grateful and proud that you are all my companions.
Last week, someone held me the appreciation he felt for our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to come to Wikipedia at this moment and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available for all.
Your work makes this possible, either by keeping the sites in operation, helping our companions to receive their payment or to keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides today more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we do, but the way we do it will have a deep effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, since this next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjust to our work and our cronograms
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C team met last night to talk about our approach and our cronogramme for the next days and months.
In that discussion, we consider what we thought would be an appropriate answer to what we are doing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
Increasingly, we wanted to remove stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce the speed, it's okay.
For all staff, contracts and contractors:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until the next warning.
We are not declaring a party; if you can work in a more normal time, this would be greatly useful for the mission.
However, the world is currently an unnecessary place, and if you have to care for your dear ones, to make buyers or to go to the doctor, our priority is your welfare.
We're not taking the account of your hours.
If it's done, it's not working.
Although it shouldn't be necessary to say it, we say it.
It is not necessary to request a license for illness or free-time payment; it only reports to its manager and helps your team to review the calendars and chronograms to ensure that the key areas of work are set out.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis from COVID-19, warn Bryan, T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with support and ensure that the management is in both its situation).
People who work for a hour will receive the total payment.
As we said, we renew our commitment with our contracts and staff partners who work for a hour.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked in normal circumstances.
This also applies if it is and can't work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use the work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incrediblely grateful, especially in these times.
Again, it's about your personal care.
We ask them to communicate with their manager so that we know what to wait and we can adapt ourselves correctly.
Some works are considered essential.
There are some things we have to keep doing.
Sites, Human Resource Operations, Confidentiality and Security and Fund Recovery teams, inter alia, perform a critical work that could require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and amend our approach to support what is essential for our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most important projects.
Reducing speed today will not hurt us tomorrow.
We don't plan "duplicate the hours to put us on the day" when the pandemy ends.
It will not be expected to work extra hours to meet terms that are no longer realistic.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and we will work to set new objectives and terms when appropriate.
What happens to the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adapt to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the cronogramme to deliver our Year Planning 2020-2012.
Our intention is to propose a plan of 2019-2020 that provides more time for the budget so that employees can prioritize the critical work, personal care and care of the dear ones as we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced time during the next weeks.
This presentation of our cronography decreases the current planning and pressure burdens throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council the next week and communicate the next steps to the delegates and teams we will only have a confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for its leadership in this situation.
State, exposure and office
Last week we learned that one of our companions from the Office of San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we contracted an antiviral team to defect all the surfaces of the Office of San Francisco.
They used an antiviral hospitalary use solution to desinfect all surfaces, as well as receipt and accents that go to our feet.
The building has adopted its own responsibility protocol, using products supporting the safety of its employees.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has made its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in the DC offices.
Since the last week, our DC office has transferred its operations to a fully remote environment according to the customs with San Francisco.
As some of our companions in New York already know, we have also spoken about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still running, but they may be delayed.
Some of our companions work remotely for the first time.
Our companions who have already worked remotely since before know that this method re-adaptations, therefore, the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of the meetings at the intervals of one or two hours as maximum.
If they are renewed longer, consider how to sect them during several days.
Define it clearly with a list of themes and send reading materials pre-cipiently.
Adoption the use of the video by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate cooperation and living connection.
Design a leader to modify each person, a person who controls questions in the chat and the list of speakers, and someone who helps to take notes (or take notes cooperatively).
Send a mail message to technical support if you need comfortable hearing.
Use the welfare refund for refrigerators.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your companions about distributed work
The RR. HH Operations Team is analyzing the principles on ergonomia based on web seminars to support the increase in the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This last week, we asked all beneficiaries of Community subventions to cancel the public events financed by Wikimedia, such as editors, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemy.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could unable to comply with its part of the activities agreed for the subvention and that there would be no penalty for long-term or modifying these objectives.
This next week we will follow additional pairs in Wikimania and other Community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at global level seems to be partly triumph for interruption and, in part, delighted by clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
Furthermore, the CRT will work to set a page in Meta-Wiki in order to give the community a space to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keep contact with COVID-19 matters
We will send you a invitation to your calendars for the next Thursday, 14:00 a.m., coordinated universal time/07:00 a.m., hour of your calendars for a special staff.
We will use this opportunity to acquire additional news, answer your questions and make time connected to each other.
We are together in this and we are available to help in how we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information about this e-mail message and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Wiki Office.
CRT will maintain these updated pages and all information on one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with the staff living in countries that are currently largely affected.
If you have any questions on travels, events, important work flows, any covering problem or anything that may need help, do not doubt noting the CRT and working with them.
We're here to help bridge support and work as a link when necessary.
If you have confidential or delegated matters, send a mail message to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations of RR. HH.
No of these changes should be considered a abandon of our work and our obligations.
Instead of this, it is a recognition that our work and our obligations are likely to be adapted in a way that has not happened before.
These are the measures we believe needed to support us mutually in order to continue working, to give our movement the necessary support and to give the world the service in which he trusts.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support us mutually and to make a place for the important work that will come in the next weeks and possibly in the next months.
We need all of you so that this may be possible and therefore we need to care and care for your families so that you can be in the best possible state when the need comes.
Now, please, take your hands down and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the team of leadership (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme that is attached to the external surface (cellal memories) of the lung cells, arteries, hearts, renes and intestines.
ECA2 is contrary to the activity of angiotensin conversion enzyme (ECA) related to decreasing the amount of angiotensin II and increased angiotensin (1-7), which converts it into a therapeutic diana for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as a point of entry to cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called HECA2.
The converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 is a metaloenzime containing zinc and is located on the surface of endotelial cells and other types.
ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a C-terminal transport domain of amino acids of collectrine.
ECA2 is a single membrane protein of type I, with its enzymatically active dominion exposed on the surface of the lung cells and other weights.
The extracellular dominion of the ECA2 is scanned from the transmemberal dominion by another enzyme known as shedasa and, as a result, the solvente protein is released in the blood torrent and, in the last instance, is excreted by the urine.
ECA2 is present in the majority of organs: ECA2 is primarily attached to the cell membrane of the olveolare cells type II of the lungs, the intestinal enterocytes, the venous arterial and endotelial cells and the arterial cells of the lising muscle of most organs.
The MARN expression of ECA2 is also located in the brain cortez, the stretched body, the hypotalam and the enzymal tronch.
The main function of ECA2 is to oppose ECA.
The ECA scans the hormone of angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstructor.
At its time, ECA2 extinguishes the amino acid carboxyl-terminal fenilalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and it isolate to form the vasodilatator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 can also eliminate several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and grelin.
ECA2 also regulates the traffic of membranes by the SLC6A19 neutro-amino acid transporter and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As transmembran protein, ECA2 serves as the main input point for some coronavirus, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus caused by SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus caused by COVID-19).
More specifically, the SRS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spy protein unit with the enzyme dominion of ECA2 on the surface of cells results in endocitosis and transmission of virus together with enzyme to the enzomas within the cells.
This input process also repeals the preparation of protein S by the guest protease serine TMPRSS2, which is currently investigating as possible therapy. This has led to certain hypothesis that reduction of ECA2 levels in cells could help combat infection.
However , several professional and regulatory associations have recommended to continue ECA and BRA standard inhibitor therapy .
A systematic metaanalysis review published on 11 July 2012 determined that "the use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34 % of the risk of neumony compared to control cases".
In addition, "the risk of neumony was also reduced in patients receiving treatment with ECA inhibitors and who had a higher risk of neumony, particularly those with brain-vascular accident and heart insufficiency.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also associated with a reduction of the mortality related to neumony, although the results were not so strong for the general risk of neumony."
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) seems to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary lesion and seems to improve pulmonary hemodinamic and oxygen saturation in lechons with acute respiratory difficulty symptoms induced by lipopolisacarides.
The average life of rhECA2 in human beings is approximately 10 hours, and the start of the action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour effect (duration).
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 may be a promised medicine for those people with intolerance to the classic renina-angiotensin inhibitors (SRA inhibitors) or in the diseases in which angiotensin II is higher. Infusion of rhECA2 was assessed in clinical trials for the treatment of the acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to help with contact trace in response to the coronavirus pandemy of 2019-2020, which is the process of identifying people ("contacts") that could have been in contact with a contagious person.
Several applications were developed or proposed with the official support of the Government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact trace applications.
Anxieties related to privacy have been raised, in particular, with regard to the systems based on the trace of the geographical location of the users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to register a user's neighborhood to other cell phones.
On 10 April 2020, Apple and Google announced jointly that they would integrate the functionality to admit those applications based on Bluetooth directly on their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is already used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, a application called TraceTogether is used.
The application was developed by a local TI community, launched as an open code application and will be given to the government. In North, "StopKorona!", an application based on Bluetooth to trace the exposure to potentially contagious people and a quick response to the health authorities.
The implementation was developed by the Minister for Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
On April 14, 2020, the application was waiting for the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government informed that the application of contact trace was on a progressive stage of development and that it would be available for its implementation in the next weeks. It was planned to use a similar application in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
So much as New Zealand are considering applications based on the application TraceTogether and the BlueTrace Protocol of Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetrage application for patients living in Moscow and have received a diagnostic from COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of the Security Engineering of the University of Cambri, exposed several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including positive and possible lack of efficiency if the application is only limited to a small part of the population.
In response to anxieties about the propagation of "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add applications related to the coronavirus in your App Store to "official" or trust only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed their concern regarding the consequences of massive monitoring to the applications of coronavirus and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemy will be dismantled once the threat occurs.
International Amnisty and more than 100 other organizations presented a communication to limit this type of monitoring.
The organizations established eight conditions for Government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportional";
Enlargement of monitoring and monitoring should have extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
security and anonymity should be protected and should have evidence of this protection;
digital monitoring should avoid exhausting discrimination and marginalisation;
any data exchange with third parties should be defined in the laws;
Protection against abuse should be implemented and the rights of citizens to respond to such abuse;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters without frontiers (Reporter without border, RSF) of Germany have also published lists of controls.
The plan proposed by Google/©e intends to address the problem of persistent monitoring by removing the trace mechanism from its operational systems when it is not necessary.
In some countries, a trace of network-based location was used instead of applications, which eliminated both the need to implement and the ability to avoid trace.
In Israel, the trace based on networks was approved.
The network-based solutions that have access to brutal location data have significant privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary that all central server systems have access to personal location data; several private protection systems that use central servers only for intercommunication have been created (see the following section).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an application was used to implement contact trace.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected trace information from various sources, including mobile device trace data and credit card transactions, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially contagiated persons.
In addition to using this information to warn on possible contacts, the Government has also made the information on the location available to the public, which is allowed due to great changes in the privacy laws after the MERS broadcast in that country.
This information is available for the public at various websites and applications. Some countries, including Germany, considered to use centralized and privacy protection systems.
On 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been published.
The trace of contacts with privacy protection is a well established concept, with a large number of published investigations, which are at least up to 2013. On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen of expert groups were working in respecting private solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth of low energy (BLE) to register the neighborhood of a user to other cell phones.
However, it is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralised approaches and is not a single protocol. The decentralised protocols include the stream of decentralised neighborhood to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, before known as event numbers, CEN) and the protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact trace for privacy protection (PACT), inter alia.
In these protocols, personal identification data never get out of the device and all packaging occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has developed SafePaths, a platform for the use of technology protecting privacy by collecting and using location or intersection of routes to trace the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Applications out of control: how to maintain personal privacy during a epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company who develops privacy technology that was also originally based on the Media Lab MIT.
SafeTrace uses safe hardware technology that allows your users to have legal location and health data with other users and officers, without compromise the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, several United groups in turn to what was essentially the same approach and with highly compatibil protocols formed the World CNC Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability of trace and warning applications, a key aspect to achieve a broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace Protocol code used by its official governmental application.
On 10 April 2020, Apple and Google, firms controling the iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking that, if they were assured, would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of Bluetooth low energy technologies and the cryptography of privacy protection.
The specifications of the main technologies used in the system have also been published.
Apple and Google are intended to implement the system in three steps:
implementation of the tools to create governments trace applications of the official coronavirus that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly in iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to cope with persistent adoption and monitoring problems, first distributing the system to updates of the operational system and then remove them from the same way as the threat has passed.
b'The reperfilation (also known as therapeutic reposition or change) is the readaptation of a medicinal product approved for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is online with the scientific research that currently seeks to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfusion of convalent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple union sites with the link.
The analysis of these union sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral medicine against proteins of COVID-19.
Among the most important daily proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the protease is similar to the papaine, the polymerase RNA addressed by ARN, helicase, protein S and ribofosfatase ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several components of medical interest that then optimized and analysed to identify the similarity of its main chain with the most approved medicines in order to accelerate the development of a powerful medicine against SARS-CoV-2 in its preclinic study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chlore is a antipauludic medicine that is also used against some self-immunal diseases.
On March 18, the OMS announced that clore and oxyclore would be related to the four medicines that would be studied in the clinical trial of Solidarity.
The Governor of New York Andrew Chomme announced that the tests from the state of New York with clore and oxyclore would begin on 24 March. On March 28 March, the FDA authori face the use of ↓oxicloro and chloro fosphate with urgent use authorisation (USA).
The treatment has not been approved by the process of clinical tests of the FDA and is authorised in accordance with an EUA only as a experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of the ↓oxicloro for profilase or treatment of infection by SARS-CoV-2" is not yet established.
The doctors said they used the medicine when "no other option".
A Turkish research team in Estambul conducted a small study on the use of chlore in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, big studies are running.
The Langone Medicine Faculty of NYU is conducting a test on the safety and efficiency of preventive use of Oxygen.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen showed that favipiravir was "really effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were negative in a average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with neumonia, half was given favipiravir, while the other half was administered to umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that existing tests supporting the medicinal product are low and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that he would buy the medicine to Japan for his reservations and would recover the military to deliver the medicine to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals for Trump purchasing the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of disease if the virus has already been multiplied.
You may not be safe for pregnant women or who are trying to conceal.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The medicines were designed to inhib HIV replication by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is changing medicines to find a composite that is one of the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the Scientific community, there have been critical assignment of resources to the readaptation of medicinal products specifically developed for HIV/SIDA.
The OMS included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment for disease by Ebola virus and infections by Marburg virus. Gilead Sciences later discovered that the remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple filovirus, neumovirus, paramixovirus and coronavirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistence through mutations that can result in a more serious disease and transmission.
Some initial studies prior to the trials suggest that remdesivir can have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are current, including two guided by hospitals at the University of Cleveland; one for people with a moderate disease and another for those who have a more serious disease.
There are three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials for hospitalized and seriously affected by COVID-19; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one without control (Italia).
New York state eats tests with azitromic antibiotics on 24 March 2020.
The National Health and Medicine Centre (CGM) of Japan is planning a clinical trial with Alvesco (cyclesonida) of Teijin, an inhalable corticoesteroid for asma, as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected by the new coronavirus.
A transforming enzyme form of angiotensin 2, a study in phase II is current and 200 severe hospitalized patients will be registered in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Montreal Heart Institute researchers in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine to reduce pulmonary inflamation and complications in patients with light symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recording 6000 adults of 40 years old and older with a COVID-19 diagnosis and light symptoms that do not repeat hospitalisation.
Pregnant women, who are amazing or who do not have an afective anticonceptive method, are not selectable.
Various anti-agulants are being evaluated in Italy.
The low molecular heparin is largely used to treat patients, thus the Italian Medicines Agency published pautes on its use.
On 14 April, a multicentric study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of natrium enoxaparin in preventional and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are devoting much attention to the readaptation of antiviral medicines that have been developed for previous fragments of SROM, SRAG and Nil O.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th and 7th of the Chinese powders
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7a and _BAR_ Chinese powders
These are some treatments that have been identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (lock the IL-6) recipient: approved by China.

b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypotetic vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed the clinical trials, there are many attempts to develop that vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes disease in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in safety studies in phase I.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major fraction was extended by the world in 2020, which designed significant investments and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the genomes published to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, the requirements for the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, production capacity, implementation and global access.
In April, the CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were investigating and developing at the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the dianes of the main platforms conducted in phase I safety studies, the following are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (fase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
Virus vector (fase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
The CEPI scientists were informed in April, in total, 115 possible vaccines are in the initial phases of development, of which 78 are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the 37 other are announced, but few information are available (see as well as planning or developing).
A phase I or II test conducts preliminar evidence of safety and immunogenicity, which is in cases of accidental, is controlled by placebo and is performed at several places, while determining more precise and effective doses.
Studies in phase III suggest to involve more participants, including a control group, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while controlling the adverse effects resulting from the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were still not in human evaluation (continued in the "preclinic research").
About 24 January 2020, the Queensland University announced that it was investigating the potential of a vaccine with molecular submission that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
Approximately 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaōne Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work in a vaccine and expected human tests to begin in 2021.
Projects for the development of vaccines in the Control and Prevention Centre were reported on 26 January 2020 and at the Hong Kong University on 28 January.
About 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companys, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started developing a vaccine.
Janssen is developing a oral vaccine with his biotechnological partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a Vaxart production association for vaccine development.
On February 8, 2020, OncoGen in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with similar technology used in treatment with neo-antigenic vaccines against cancer.
On 25 March, the leader of the research institution announced that the vaccine was completed and that the tests were beginning.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidy from Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-O§ology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key pepty vaccine against COVID-19.
They would produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "in the 90 days".
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command in the Fuerte Detrick and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in the west of Maryland, announced that they were working in a vaccine.
By 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novax Inc.
in the development and production of a vaccine.
The associates also announced plans for a clinical test and a clinical test at phase I for July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 isolated and that, despite rapid progress, it would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, Quebec, informed the development of a similar part of coronavirus with partial financing of Canadian Research Institutes in Health.
The potential vaccine is at the stage of research and is expected that human tests begin in July or August 2020.
The Guardian reported that the President of the United States Donald Trump had offered CureVac "a large amount of money for access to a vaccine against the COVID-19", in which the German Government complained.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical and Pfizer company announced an association with the German BioNTech company to develop a vaccine based on ARNm together.
The potential vaccine based on ARNm BNT162, is currently in preclinical tests and is expected that clinical tests begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, a Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have the results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that tests in humans of the possible final vaccine could be started in the tube.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in the Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of 4.9 million USD in a COVID-19 investigation association, including Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Viena, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which leads to the total investment of the EPI to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
Other CEPI partners for the development of a vaccine against the COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the Hong Kong University, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officers announced that scientists started tests in six possible vaccines.
Londres Imperial College Researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a RNA vaccine with self-replication against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within the 14 days of receipt of China's sequence.
For the end of March, the Canadian Government announced a financing of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures against COVID-19, which includes a large number of possible vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
More or less at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, planning to create a national vaccine bank with several new vaccines that could be used if another cronavir broadcast occurred.
On 2 April 2020, researchers of the Pittsburgh University Medicine Faculty announced PittCoVacc's tests, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in ratons, and said "the vaccines of S1 of SARS-CoV-2 administrated by MNA received powerful responses from the specific antibodies (in ratons) that were evident two weeks after vaccination."
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the Pharmaceutical Faculty of the Waterloo University announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a narrow pulverizer.
Using territory, the DNA will be designed to replicate within human Property and produce innocent particulates similar to virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, the industrial sector and three United States universities gathered resources for IBM supercomputers, together with computer resources in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise cloud, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
This means that they can have advantages beyond the previous disease.
Another random trial inside seeks to register 4170 workers healthy.
The vaccines that are developing may not be safe or effective.
Initial investigations to evaluate the efficiency of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other non-human animals and primates, show the need to comply with biosecurity protection measures at level 3 for the maintenance of live virus and international coordination in order to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vacuums against SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine protecting against the SRAG that has proved to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat the SRAG was a priority for Governments and public health agencies worldwide. There is also no confirmed vaccine against the SROM.
When the SROM was generalised, it was believed that existing SRAG research could be a useful model for developing vaccines and treatments against infection by MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, a vaccine against the SROM (based on DNA) completed the clinical tests in phase I in humans, other three were currently, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one of MVA vectors (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications in social media promoted a conspirative theory that caused COVID-19 virus was known and there was already a vaccine.
Patents cited by various social media publications are related to existing patents for genetic and vaccine sequences for other coronavirus ceps, such as the coronavirus of the SRAG.
b'The disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by the coronavirus of severe respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, thickness and difficulty to breathe.
Other symptoms are fat, muscular pain, diarrhea, gargant pain, olfate loss and abdominal pain.
The time between the exposure and the beginning of the symptoms often is about five days, but it can vary between two and fourteen days.
Although most of the cases result in light symptoms, some progress to viral neumony and multiorganic insufficiency.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153.000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have been recovered. The virus is mainly spread between people during the close contact, generally through toxer, stornup or talking.
Although these capsules are produced when exhaling, they normally fall on the floor or on the surfaces, rather than being contagious in long distances.
People can also be affected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching the eyes, narrow or mouth.
The virus can survive in surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the symptoms beginning, although propagation is also possible before the symptoms and in the late stages of the disease appear. The standard method for diagnosis is the reaction in the stream of polymerase with reverse transscription in real time (rRT-PCR) of a nasofaring hysopath.
The use of maskers is recommended for those who suspect that they have virus and their careers.
The recommendations on the use of maskers for the general public were different; some authorities recommend not to use them, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine or treatment against COVID-19.
Local disease transmission has been registered in most countries in the six regions of the WHO.
Those who are infected by the virus may be asymptomatic or have similar symptoms to those of the influenza, such as fever, tough, and difficulty to breathe.
The symptoms of emergency include difficulty to breathe, pain or persistent pressure in the breast, confusion, difficulty to walk and face or to face. If these symptoms are presented, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the higher respiratory paths, such as horn, narrow gote and throat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomit and diarrhea, have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China were initially oppressioned in the knife and pappings.
In some, disease progressed to neumony, multiorganic insuficiency and death.
This is called incubation period.
The period of incubation of COVID-19 is often five to six days, but it may vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of those who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, the preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to promoting disease.
The proportion of infected people who have no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. The Centres for Control and Prevention of Korean Sickness (KCDC) reported that 20% of the confirmed cases were asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China eats to include asymptomatic cases in the daily cases on 1 April, and from the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
So both the spot as well as the saliva can have big viral burdens.
Speaking with a high voice freeer hot than when speaking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore discovered that the mouth could not be covered by the toser can make the hair travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus does not often be air transmission, the National Science AGEA suggested that transmission through biological soles is possible and explained that air collectors were given positive in the virus RNA in the passport outside the people's rooms.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP), can cause respiratory secretions and, therefore, air transmission.
Although there are anxieties about the possibility of propagation by the processes, the risk is considered low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation is possible before the beginning of the symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of Sickness (ECDC) explains that a person generally infects two or three. The virus survives hours or days on the surface.
Specificly, the virus was detected during one day in the carton, up to three days in the plastic (polypropylene) and inoxidable steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in products with 99 % copper.
However, this varied from humidity and temperature.
Jabbin and detergent are also effective if they are correctly used. Jabbon products degradate the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidin glucanate (a cherurgical desinfektor), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken in a average of two days after hospitalisation.
In five of six patients, the first show had the highest viral burden. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral burden was observed on the second test day.
The coronavirus of the severe respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated by three people with neumonia connected to a group of aggressive respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the home jabbin kills the virus, since it returns its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is east-related with the SARS-CoV origin.
The lungs are the most affected organs of COVID-19 because the virus enters anfitrion cells through the conversion enzyme of angiotensin I type 2 (ECA2), which increases more in the olveolare cells of type II of lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "specula" (peplomer) to connect to ECA2 and enter the anfitrion cell.
In 12% of hospitalized infections in Wuhan, China, an aggressive heart failure was identified, which is most frequently in serious disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammation response and the disturbance of the immune system during the development of disease, but the aggressive myocardio depression may be related to the ECA2 receptors in the heart.
ECA2 recipients have a high expression in their heart and participate in their functioning.
High trombosis (31%) and venosa tromboembolia (25%) were detected in patients in the UCI with infections by COVID-19 virus and may be related to a predominant bad. In the autopsy of people who were missing by COVID-19, difused alveolar damage (DAD) and inflamatorial infills with linfocites in lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism by epitelial cells expressing ECA2 of respiratory paths, patients with serious COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, it was observed that GM-CSF patogenic Linfocites T secretors are associated with the recycling of IL-6 monocytes and a serious lung patology in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsies, linfocytical infiltrates were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect disease.
The standard test method is the reaction in the stream of polymerase with inverse transscription in real time (RRT-PCR).
The test is often made in samples of respiratory paths obtained by a nasopharing hysopath; however, samples of narrow hisopade or spot can also be used.
The results are generally available between a few hours or two days.
Blood analysis can also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two weeks of difference and the results have a very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists succeeded to isolate the coronavirus sequence and published the genetic sequence so that worldwide people could develop indipendently tests of reaction in the polymerase chain (PCR) to detect the infection by the virus.
On 4 April 2020, antibodies tests (which can detect active infections and whether the person was infected in the past) were developed, but they were not used extensively.
Experience in China with evidence has shown that the precision is only from 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States adopted the first diagnosis test immediately on 21 March 2020 to use it for the end of that month. The diagnostic patterns published by the Hospital Zhongnan University of Wuhan suggested methods to detect infections based on the clinical features and the epidemiological risk.
The bilateral multilateral glass opacities with periferic, asimetric and later distribution are common in the initial stages of the infection.
As the disease progresses, sub-pleural domination, disordered impairment pattern (septal lobulilling with variable alveolar filled) and consolidation can appear.
There are few data available on microscopic lesions and physiopatology of COVID-19.
The main patological results of autopsy are the following:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, lung consolidation and lung edema
Four types of severity of viral neumony can be observed:
Light neumonium: pulmonary edema, neumotic hyperplasia, atypically big neumotics, interstitial inflamation with infiltration of linfocites and forming giant cells with multiple nuclears
Severe neumony: difused alveolar damage (DAD) with difused alveolares exhausted.
DAD is caused by aggressive respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and serious hypoxemy.
curing neumony: organisation of exhibitions in alveolary cavitats and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Sanger: intravascular coagulation designed (CID); leucoeritroblastic reaction
Prevention measures to reduce infection opportunities include staying in the house, avoiding places with many people, washing hands with water and jabbling often for at least 20 seconds, having a good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, narrows or mouth without washing hands.
CDCs recommend to cover the mouth and narrow with a paint when tossing or storndraging and, if there is no panoules, use the internal part of the code.
An appropriate hygiene from the hands is recommended after toser or stornudar.
CDCs have recommended the use of screenshots in public places, one of the reasons is to limit transmission by asymptomatic people.Social distance strategy seeks to reduce contacts of people infected with large groups by closing schools and jobs, restricting travel and cancelling public meetings.
Distance patterns also indicate that people must maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until 2021, as soon as a key part to control COVID-19 is trying to prevent the epidemic pico, which is known as "planning the curve".
CDCs also recommend to wash their hands often with water and jabone for at least, 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are swimming, before eating and after sounding the nose, toser or stornudar.
They also recommend the use of a deinfectant for hands of alcohol with a minimum of 60% of alcohol but only when there is no water and jabbon available at the time. For areas where defectants for hands are not easy to achieve, the WHO produces two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobian activity results from etanol or isopropanol.
The peroxide of ®ogen is used to help eliminate the steroids in the alcohol; "is not an active substance for the antisepsia of the hands".
Glicerol is added as humid.
Patients are cared for support, which may include rehydration, oxygenotherapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDCs recommend that those who suspect that they have the virus use a simple mask.
oxidation by extra-corporal membrane (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory insufficiency, but the benefits are still being analysed.
To improve immunity, a personal hygiene and lifestyle and healthy food are recommended.
Support treatments may be useful for those who have light symptoms at the initial stage of the infection. The WHO and the National Health Committee of China have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized people with COVID-19.
Intensity and neumologs in the United States compiled the recommendations of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some doctoral professionals recommend appearamol (acetaminofene) instead of ibuprofene.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of virus, especially in health care environments when procedures can be generated, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
CDCs recommend health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 to place the patient in a air infection isolation area (AIIR), as well as to use standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. CDCs highlight the rules for the use of personal protection equipment (EPP) during the pandemy.
The recommended equipment are EPP bath, mascarilla, protectors and medical guards. When available, respirators are preferred (instead of maskers).
N95 maskers are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authori it is used by an urgent use authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect against particulates in the air, such as dust, but the efficiency is not guaranteed against a specific biological agent that is not set out in the product indications.
When no maskers are available, CDCs recommend the use of protector chats or, as the last resource, case maskers.
Most of the cases of COVID-19 are not sufficiently serious to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are it.
This type of respiratory support is actively studied for hospitalized people with respiratory insufficiency related to COVIDA-19, and there is already a certain evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high fluid nasal channel or positive bipression in the respiratory roads.
It is not yet known whether any of these two benefits the same to the people in critical state.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of sole particulates compared to the high fluid nasal canal. Severe cases are mainly given to adults older than 60 years and especially to 80 years older.
Many developed countries have not enough head beds in hospitals, which limits the capacity of the health system to handle the sudden increase in serious cases of COVID-19 re-hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% disappeared.
In China, approximately 30% of hospitalized people with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the UCI.
Mechanical ventilation returns more complete when a patient with COVID-19 presents an aggressive respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and oxidation is more difficult.
respirators are required with different modes of pressure control and PPTE to maximize oxygen supply, while the risk of pulmonary lesion associated with the respirator and neumotorax is reduced.
The oldest respirators may not count with high PPTE.
The research on possible treatments eats in January 2020 and several antiviral medicines are in clinical trials.
The remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may take long until 2021, several medicines are already tested for other uses or are in advanced tests.
Antiviral medicines may be tested in persons with serious disease.
WHO recommends volunteers to participate in tests of efficiency and safety of possible treatments. The FDA received a temporary authorisation for the convalent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is serious and immediate.
It has not been subject to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China lan’s mobile application to address the breach of disease.
Users should enter their name and identification number.
The application may detect the "heavy contact" and thus a potential risk of infection through monitoring data.
Each user can also control the status of other three users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application recommends not only self-finishing, but also warning local health officers. Analysis of cell information macrodata, face recognition technology, monitoring mobile phones and artificial intellectuality are used to trace infected people and those with whom they were contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed the security agencies to trace data from the mobile phones of persons who were suspicioned to have coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect those who can enter contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom held the summary data of the location of phones with the German Federal Government Agency, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the propagation of virus.
Russia implemented the facial recognition technology to detect incompliance with quarantine.
The Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said that mobile telephone operators have informed you that "40% of the people are still moved."
The German Government carried out a 48-hour-end hackaton with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a world request for creative solutions against the propagation of the coronavirus.
People may feel distress for quarantine, travel restrictions and secondary effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
The BBC cited Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, singleness, anxiety for health, stress and economic problems are a perfect torment for mental health and people's welfare."
The disease may follow a light evolution with few or without symptoms, so it will seem to other diseases of the higher respiratory paths, such as the common frozen.
Left cases are to be recovered within two weeks, while serious or critical may take three to six weeks to do it.
Pregnancy women may be risked to take serious infection by COVID-19, according to other similar virus data such as SRAG and SROM virus, but data from COVID-19 are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 can affect lungs and cause neumony.
In cases of more seriousness, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to the water respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) which causes respiratory insufficiency, septic choice and multiorganic insufficiency.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, change in coagulation and heart damage, renal and hepatic.
The change in coagulation, particularly the increase in protombin time, has been indicated in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, while the change in renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately between 20 and 30% of people with CODIV-19 have high hepatic enzymes (aminotransferase).
The same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalisation.
However, for patients transferred to the UCI, it spent a average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an initial study of cases, the average time from the manifestation of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study of the China National Health Commission (NHC), the rate of mortality between men was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopatological tests of post-mortem lung samples show difused alveolar damage with cell fibromyxide exhausted in both lungs.
Virus citopatic changes were observed in the nemocites.
The image of the lungs was similar to the aguda respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, the heart damage resulted from high levels of tropone or heart paro.
The data of March of the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had a pre-existing affair, and medical resources and socioeconomic aspects of a region may also affect mortality.
The estimates of mortality by affliction were different from these regional differences, but also from methodological difficulties.
Insufficient calculation of light cases can make the rate of mortality overestimated.
However, the fact that death is the result of cases in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is under estimation.
The smokers had 1.4 times more opportunities to suffer serious symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more opportunities to need intensive care or disappear in comparison with non-rounders.
The Hospital Authority of Hong Kong found a decrease of 20 to 30% of the lung capacity in some people recovered from the disease, and the lung images suggested the influence of organs.
This can also cause intensive care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections produced a long-term immunity in persons recovered from disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronavirus, but cases recovered from COVID-19 were reported that later gave positive in coronavirus.
These cases are considered to be a deterioration of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
It is considered that this virus is natural and of animal origin, through an interested infection.
The real origin is not known, but, for December 2019, the propagation of the infection was almost completely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in the Lancet in January 2020, indicated as the first date of the beginning of symptoms to 1 December 2019.
Official publications of the WHO reported that the first manifestation of the symptoms was on 8 December 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These numbers were different by region and in time, as well as by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time passed from the initial break and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
For the end of 2019, the WHO assigned CIE-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths with confirmation of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a COVID-19 clinical or epidemiological diagnosis without confirmation of infection by SARS-CoV-2. The letality rate reflects the amount of deaths divided by the number of cases divided in a given time period.
Based on the statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins, the total letality rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
The number was different by region. Other measures include the rate of letality in patients ≥ CFR, which reflects the percentage of people who die from a disease, and the rate of letality in infected people, which reflects the percentage of infected people (with or without diagnostic) died from a disease.
These statistics are not of time and follow a particular population from the infection to the resolution of the cases.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these can provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the broad center in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already fallen.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread during the carnaval festivals and affected the youngest, so there was a low mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overlooked.
In Netherlands, approximately 3% of the population has antibodies, it was determined from blood donors.
It was confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died by COVID-19.
The impact of pandemy and rate of mortality are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among men in the studies carried out in China and Italy.
The biggest risk of men is for those who are in their 50, and the breach between men and women is solely 90 years old.
In China, the rate of mortality was 2.8 in males and 1.7 in women.
The accurate reasons for this difference by sex are not known, but it may be due to genetic and conductive factors.
The immunological differences based on sex, the smaller number of women who smoke and the fact that men have concomitant diseases, such as hypertension, could have contributed to the highest mortality rate of men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were males and 72% of the killed by COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. Government did not draw information on sex in infections by the COVID-19 virus.
Research shows that virus diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAG, affect men and women differently.
A greater percentage of healthy workers, particularly the staff, are women, and have more opportunities to exhibit virus.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
The head of the OMS Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 at the date of discovery: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), species or group of persons, in accordance with international recommendations, is designed to prevent stimulation. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called coronavirus of the severe respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in public communications.
It is common that "coronavirus" is used to refer to both disease and virus.
It was common to refer to the virus and disease such as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication that no sites in the name of virus and diseases were used.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
As a result of the limitations of capacity in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal hisopes and parts of respirators.
For example, when a Italian hospital needed urgently the vacuum of a respirator and the supplier could not deliver it at the time required, a local emergency company performed inverse engineering and printed the 100 vacuums necessary during the night.
After the initial break of the COVID-19, conspiracy, information and disinformation on origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that were rapidly spread via the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study did not find evidence of viral replication in wheat, feet or poles.
There are no medicines or vaccines approved to treat disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector are conducting international investigations on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization started the "SOLIDARIDAD Test" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most promising antiviral compositions in relation to effectiveness.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are developing actively possible vaccines.
Previous work on the SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ECA2 recipient to enter in human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers seek to develop a full virus vaccine.
The use of that virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at generating a quick immune response from the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, submunity vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that implies the immune system to certain virus submunities.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this investigation is focused on protein S that helps the virus to be placed in the ECA2 recipient.
A third strategy is nuclear acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technology for creating vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficiency. On March 16, 2020, they eat the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an innocent copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes disease. It is suggested that the antibodies-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
In April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven tests evaluated already approved treatments for the paludism, including four studies on ↑oxicloro or chloro.
Release antiviral medicines constitute most of the Chinese research, including nine tests in phase III on remdesivir in several countries and which should report for the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on vaccine and possible medicines against COVID-19 was currently evaluated. Several antiviral medicines for the treatment of COVID-19, including: remdesivir, chloro and hydrochloro, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with beta-interferon were evaluated.
In March 2020, there is an attempt evidence of the efficiency of remdesivir.
The clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Clinical studies in phase III are conducted in the United States, China and Italy. The clore, used earlier to treat the paludism, were studied in China in February 2020. The results obtained were preliminar.
However, there are requests for parent reviews for the investigation.
San Core and China's Sanhedrin authorities recommend the use of chloro.
However, although the Wuhan Virology Institute recommends a daily dose of a gram, it notes that the double of this dose is very dangerous and may be letal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent use authorisation for ↓oxicloro and clorry to discretion of patients treated with COVID-19. The 7th and 7a of the Chinese pautas includes also the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high ribavirin dose is needed to inhibe SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
More in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial cebad of protein S performing the transmembran serin-protease type 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the income of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ECA2 recipient.
The studies of chloro- and oxoxicor with or without azitromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community to adopt these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
Freedom of citokins may be a complication of the last stages of COVID-19 serious.
There is evidence that the Oxyclore may have properties to avoid freedom of citokins. The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in the treatment pautas after the completion of a small study.
It is found in a non-allocated national test in phase II in Italy after observation of positive results in persons with serious disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a series of blood analysis of ferritine to identify cytokine liberations, you have contraryed these effects, which are believed are the cause of death of some infected people.
FDA approved the interleucina-6 recipient antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of cytocine release syndrome resistant to steroids induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T linfocides in 2017.
Until the date, there are no controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for the CRS.
The transfer of cleaned and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have been recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a passive immunisation method without vaccines.
This strategy has been tried with the SRAG with unconclusive results.
Virical neutralisation is the expected action mechanism through which a passive treatment with antibodies can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cell citotoxicity depending on antibodies or fagocitosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies are developed, for example, using monoclonal antibodies manufactured.
The production of convalent sugar, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could increase to achieve a faster distribution.
