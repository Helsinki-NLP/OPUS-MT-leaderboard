The Parliament did not support a amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Parliament of Ukraine has now made the proposal to reject the amendment to the section of the Penal Code in which it is condemned to the leader of the opposition of Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the doors to the extract of the Minister, but the parliamentaries made the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years of prison by the presumed signing of an agreement with Russian devastating for Ukraine on purchasing natural gas.
The sentence is not yet firm, the court of appeal has the obligation to revise it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political vengeance of the regime, and even in O'e there have been doubts on the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to revoke paragraph 365 of the Penal Code with which the former Prime Minister was condemned was supported by 147 members in the vote.
226 votes would be required for its approval.
Libya’s Victory
The history of liberal release, or of liberal rebellion, has already losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the wilderness and without him there is no war.
Remaining for setting who the winner is
As it is usual in the region, the Islamists have won elections, but now it is to dilute if it is moderated or radical.
The National Council of Transition has entrusted the traditional law, sharia, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the ladrons will cut their hand.
Women can already go by emancipating themselves and the apostates waiting for their implementation and so successfully.
Instead of the person of the dictator, the society, composed of military tribes, will be joined by the Coran.
In Libya there will be a order that we can't imagine and that we can't certainly.
However, our lifestyle is not the only or objectively the best, and, probably, it did not agree to the libius mentioned.
It is true that it does not stop surprising that islamic fighters would accept thanks for the help of the dogs.
The only justification was that, from its view, NATO's attacks would not lead them to a general and great, but to God, whose greatness was held after each of the successful interventions.
When winners are searched in Libya, O'e is not among them.
We are arrested in a Tyrote of which is served by islamists and our politicians to dismiss a dictator in the person of a political alien without guarantees of benefits.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militaryly.
In this case, locals don't have a problem to expel the "crossed"
But, without occupation, will the oil be made with the free black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that no, but it may finally be that O'e may assume protection of human rights.
Always the followers of the shary are not crossing us.
Start a new era of the crisis
France and the rest of Europe go to the jail of the investor seeker
A statistical torbelline has been extended by Europe
Individual States have published their PIB data for Q3.
The Czech economy has grown during the interquatrimestral period while France and Germany have grown.
However, the good market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer defined in Italy but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistics of the Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
The German PIB increased 0.5% of the estimated, France 0.4%
Both countries have published the data of the second quarter, in Germany has improved more than expected (instead of 0.3 per cent growth in place of 0.1 per cent), although in France there was a light reduction in 0.1 per cent (original data talked about this).
The Czech economy increased interannually 1,5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the interquatrimestral period, the brutal internal product (PIB) has been decreased and the CSU is complied with the trend to gradual disacceleration in the growth of economic development.
The results are even worse than the analysts' previews.
Main events:
Interannually, the Czech economy increased by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but it has been four-meaning.
In the third quarter, the German economy, the previous and stationally recalculated data, increased by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, increased 0.2%, which corresponds to the expectations of analystes.
Greek economy has fallen interannually on 5.2%.
The interest of their salaries at ten years is 28.45%.
The interest of good Italian and Spanish has grown up to critical limits.
The problem situation begins to affect Austria, Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of good Czech at ten years remain at 4%, although the situation in the area is deteriorating.
In Germany there are votes that say that the ECB should grant loans in the last instance.
Czechs are classified for Eurocope.
They won 1:0 and celebrated the classification with a premium 200 million.
The football team fills with the most difficult work of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Chech and the portrait Peter Jiráček, the victory was given for 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of happiness at the second time, was fantasticly defended from the attacks of the local team, so it will not be missing the meeting of the European campaign.
IHNED.cz continued detailed development of the party in a mine report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of happiness in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the deterioration of the local team to the end, and also to the excellent game of Chech and the heroic Jiráček, wined for 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated its pass to the European Campeonate.
As a result of the corrective Czech defence, the Montenegros did not press until the second half.
The two damaged parties were Damjanović and Vučinč, who left two large occasions.
Furthermore, thanks to the genuine Petr Čech, the eleventh Czech will not miss the meeting of the Copa of Europe, so the arches of the national football will reach an approximately 200 million crowns.
Since the first minutes, a good official game has been given.
Both teams worked only to keep the lines and played nothing more at the centre of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, patents in the other defence field, just what the Defence Czech suspected to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die by the nuclear programme of their country.
They formed a human escudo.
A number of centuries of university students have developed human escudos around nuclear installations in Iran.
They want to express their support to the nuclear programme of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
Students began to pray on Tuesday at midnight before the installations and then covered Slovaks of death to the United States and Israel.
Several hundreds of university students formed on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan human escudos around the nuclear technology centre in which it works with urian.
They claim to demonstrate that they are willing to defend the nuclear programme of their country with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, if all indicators are, is attempted to obtain nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
Students began to pray at midday before the nuclear facilities of Isfahan and then launched Slogans of death against the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose goal would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, not only the centre of Isfahan, but also the installations of Natanz, where urian is rich.
Daily menu of a obesity child: doesn't break up and dinner
More than one third of children with age between 9 and 13 years have overweight problems, where the over-case affects 9% of the school population and obesity at 5%.
Obessed children are in their majority of families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, it is separated from current investigations.
It is again demonstrated the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy person's development, as well as the models of reference.
In the table, children are fed, for example, of embedded at least with a double frequency than the children of families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obess had dinnered frit patates the day before the analysis, which is linked to the "Obiesity is not a ca".
In children with overweight, there is no custom to practice sports, which is applicable to most of the current families, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Inquiry conducted at 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of the past school year and participated in the same nearly 900 basic educational children in all Czech Republic.
It was the second and § of the programme of "The Obesity of No Is a Ca" which supported the Safety-General Company and the Unilever company.
Until now, more than 12 thousand children have participated in the project from the fourth to the eighth course.
A suitable and quite family exercise diet are determining factors, which reduce note the number of children with overweight and even obesity.
"Only half of the kids in question have answered that they have five daily foods is the regime: breakfast, breakfast, food, merchandise and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," is one of the results of the investigation.
No breakfast but inbut for dinner
Specialists warn that in a healthy development, the details are also important, for example, to have a fixed hour for breakfast in the family.
Nevertheless, in Czechland only 23% of the school families are spending at the same time.
In most families, each one breaks alone.
But the worst thing was to discover that in 10% of the homes nothing was born.
The breakfast, however, is the basis for a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in obesity children's families, freshly consumption is much more frequently consumed.
Almost everyone - independently of the weight - drink the sweet refrigerated daily (70%).
In general, more than 40% of the children inquired, however, in their parents, this result is reduced by less than half, only 15%.
Fabric your diet
The next stage of the study enabled the chosen horse (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 colleges) to increase their own diets from all possible offers is their pleasures and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children in age between 12 and 15, from the view of a healthy food, are very away from the ideal."
Among their favorite foods are the pawl, the meat and the sweet
"It is especially alarming the popularity of sweet refreshes," it is warned in the final study report.
As primary food, the palm is carrying the packa and following the bird meat nearly.
Practically, children always have grass and pleasure for fish and grass is very low.
Switch to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their food habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of participants in the study, who filled the questionnaire after the end of the " Obesity is not a cage", in many cases a significant change was made to the principles of healthy food," it was pointed out in the results of the study.
He calls attention, for example, on sweet refrigerators, where many children would begin to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also choose bird meat and fish for main food more frequently in the questionary and restrict the consumption of sweet food and harine derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, supporting professionals
In the introductory article, how the stylists are, I have already regret a little that the initial lessons were already loaded.
I didn't know how it would go.
Conferences of three professionals in the branch, how to dress problems and also a seminar on how it works in the spectacle world.
And it'll be worse.
How closeer the final reviews, more information and practical tasks are waiting for us
And although the course is developed every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer an alfiler.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to clothe the woman who has no perfect symmetry.
And that's the big majority.
Someone's cocktail, someone has a styled figure without the appropriate curves, and someone's suffering overweight.
The stylist must know optically swimming a wide worm, expanding a neck or re-creating the needed curves
Some trucks have given us about how to highlight the female body of the kind of Jennifer López, of huge knifes and chairs but cingure east and at the same time not clothing it in a too difficult way
If, for example, the difference between the cinture and the chairs is so much that the wallet or the buttons are not adapted, it is worth making at least one extra screen piece to measure.
They will certainly not repent, because the clothes that you feel perfectly impugnable.
With a mixed wallet you will feel much better than with one that doesn't stop moving, rise up, dance in the circle, etc.
The stylised body can be allowed to clothe clothes with clothes, ornaments, borders or flags.
There are certainly many types of different and body information, so I am glad that I have a whole week to put orders on my head all of this information.
And even so, I'm afraid with the assigned task, I have more than over.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous, to whom two clothes must be designed: one for day and one for night.
It must be taken into account the current aspect, the model style that is suitable to the person concerned.
I've been touched with "stopping" in Miranda Kerr, maybe you know the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I cry for inside, for me it's much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which lastly will have grew some hundred kilos ( Please take into account the exageration), or the youngest Selena Gómez.
We have to cut them out of the magazines or search them on the Internet and print them, to then draw them graphically.
The moodboard, which is as it is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphical design.
It is also important to think about the graphical part of stylism.
Therefore, the stylist has not only seen physically, but also cares about products pages in magazines (specific topics such as trends, bottles, coverages, etc.).
All of that the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik spoke to us.
But this is all left for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialist guests encouraged the Sabbath conference with information about any sort of body.
The Honza Pokorny stylist, the Jakub Polanka Mode Designer and the Ben Renč Mode Grapher.
Jakub reminded us that the mode is an illusion and the stylist should know to take him away from this.
And a good stylist can work with the same clothes of clothes in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such gabardin (or, as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed to the classic with vacuums and cakes, but also serves to clothe the naked body with tacton shoes and photograph it as if it was actually a clothing.
Or it's enough to pull it up and get up the neck to get a completely different image.
"Juga with that," he insisted on us.
What is most valuable is the following advice: "To begin working, you must first know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
Finally, I am clear why we remember all these formulas, which is combined with what, if then we find different results in the modern magazines.
That's without talking about defiles.
Thanks to Ben, I know a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reservation than he wants to photograph.
So for a mode story that has ten pages (so ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifty.
And besides the photos, the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of them are different than they are used in reality.
All that must be taken into account at the time of designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorny assured us that the image and style are themselves, in many cases, the half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary song, but the image and the marquet have made her a world star.
In Czech Republic, there is still no clear trend to use stylist services.
Even the famous characters also find it inutile (I have enough abilities, my physical aspect does not have so much importance).
And when someone asks us our services, you need to note that it's very different that they indicate us a very different size than your real (minor).
Then there is only a guglear and find out whether the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has engrossed/adelgazed, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist doesn't have enough orientation in the mode, but he needs to understand outfit.
Your work, especially, should be communicated with the people you have seen, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
You can appreciate people, it doesn't make less, defends their opinions.
"When a director contracts you to classify her clothes and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can't take and take all that he had and say, "Hue what horrible!"
"Find at least a couple of things you can think and recommend that someone can put them," said Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything must be in the name "placovka", namely the workball.
This is fixed around the cinture and all necessary tools are set.
They are objects such as tigers, such as tissues, kitapeluses, or imperdible. There is also nailon hedge (which serves the stylist during the seats of products such as bottles or fats), special clothing pins forward, if this was greater (alphys and other type of hangs are not allowed, because they could damage the weight), or a cotton game.
To not stay in the passive hearing and putting something into practice, we have put on the shoes' ground.
Even during photographs in the study, in a plane surface, the ground could be harmed and much more the outside.
And we did no more than clothing and clothing.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the tigers so that we could not hurt them for a accident.
So I had to be very able.
Mario gave me a pleasure in praising my job without reservations.
The truth is that I don't get those abilities very well.
This is just a small part of all we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already understood that dedication to the stylism at professional level is not a rose path, but it gives me exactly what people say.
A Need for Speed: The is competible throughout America.
Reference
A trip, in principle disappointed, is complicated because of a series of improper disasters of a routine travel during the morning tour.
In a certain way, it was able to cover expectations, but it does not serve anything, if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, to which the title is added, has been awakening great expectations before its alien.
I promised that he would give new airs to the former Need for Speed career saga and, based on the shown, appears as a game that should not end again being a kind of action without more.
We also feel interesting to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main characterization comes down from the car and walks by its own feet.
As often occurred in the NFS series, the results were not very different about what we expected.
There are careers that can be given for acceptable, but in the total clip are lost points due to absurd failure, which already appear in the series since years.
In fact, it can't be called mistakes, but it is better than the incomprehensible disappointment of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You sit on the flight on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The road is divided in ten steps and then in more than fifty carriers.
It deduces that each career has a different path and the stages are located in different environments, which result very different and interesting.
Thus, one has neither the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant in view, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous delivery of the series.
That's why it's nothing from the other world.
But the pass through the wilderness, the ocean landscape or the high mountains of snow produce a very pleasant visual effect.
Furthermore, carriers are differentiated from time to time by a atpic element.
For example, in the wilderness, you find a sand storm that reduces the visibility.
Instead, in the mountains, you need to be careful so that you don't bury a wallet.
It is that, each of the careers is very well developed.
There's just a couple of models, but it's enough.
A minute, you're trying to advance a number of rivals (normal in a classic career), then try to win time (classic cronometric duty) and then wait for a threat against one single opponent.
In the middle of all this, sometimes the police appears, which doesn't make it but make things more difficult.
Newness is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always clicking the right button at the right moment.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less landscapes in the game than you could expect (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not come to be disappointed and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game become more interesting.
The model of conduct follows the loops of the previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big thing, but it can't be bad.
If you're looking for a real simulation, you'll be able to search anywhere else.
But a career conceived with a lot of action is worth this driving style, although we can find something better between competition games.
Till here, all right.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
In contrast to the correct direction models, the same is no longer happening with the collections.
Games of this type do not need to be expected to recreate complicated deformations and collections, but actually before a fight against any object, you can't predict how your car will repeat, which is not all right.
It is typical that, by making a very adjusted progress or making the car with a normal traffic, there are only light rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends doing uncontrolled piroetes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the resetation system, there are no big problems, but it can cause you to be wrong humor.
Resets are planned so that, when you suffer an accident or get out of the track, the game returns you to the last redistribution point in the track.
However, in each career only five resets are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the career from the beginning.
So it's not more than a help if something's wrong, but it's not very trustworthy.
Sometimes, neither resettlement helps, but only helps to maintain the given step of memory.
A great disappointment of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, it is necessary to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Sometimes you find yourself in some place "civil vehicles" always with the same configuration, although you are the first, five or five minutes before or later.
This makes it angry, especially, when you see two cars going to meet in opposite directions, your counterpart continues without problems, but when you come, you should turn or quickly breathe.
It's the same as you've arrived, because it's scheduled because the "surprise" will always happen before you in your eyes.
In addition, opponents have another benefit.
You will come to sites where, without taking into account the moment, the same opposite will always advance you on the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, in a long pool, which results even more choking.
Your opposite must come before you, at any price.
When he goes before you, the vision of the cars that come before you is difficult, so at the beginning you can do the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum suspension and adrenaline doses, but the execution is so apparent that it certainly deceives you.
And it's a pen, because although the model of the travel is simple, the game is fun and with action, so often it is not possible to follow the details what happens or where.
And actually equal, if the debt takes the idea with fifty tracks or the classification in the career so that it doesn't cut off the disgrace, or anything else.
An idea is the change of cars during the careers.
You must be careful about gasoline surrounders on the side of the road, because you just have to change your car, even though in most cases you will have enough of what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for the straightways and super-sport exotics for a technical drive, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
Furthermore, the main story thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, namely, there are careers in concrete places that you will know about the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both for challenges and accounts.
When reaching the higher level, the driver opens several options, starting by the car and finishing with the profile funds.
At the same time, an autolog function has been connected, which compares your results to the other players and makes other Community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last career is done in history.
With the car you arrive to the metro tunnel (passe), where you start running to darkness through the ways (passe).
The speedymeter marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and suddenly, behind you the convoy of the metro and takes you forward without more.
In the editor, we will certainly have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game nobody thought if he had a little or if the real authors took us for a paint of bubbles.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most of the pleasant cases, sometimes to surroundings.
Then what thinks that, at the most tenso moments, the quality of the image is decreased and sometimes seriously.
This affects particularly the accidents where many participants are involved, when the quality of image is not valid anymore.
Audio is good and the sound band is a question of pleasure.
In order to please most of the youth group, the sound band belongs to the category "--one of your father and your mother", but it can be assumed that nobody would buy the game only for your music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The is therefore very confused.
If the game avoids absolutely foolish errors, we would have problems with the thee is the best NFS game in the past years.
Give the feeling that the game is not finished.
The entertainment is safe, but prepared because the errors will hit you in your eyes with the strength of some port reflectors.

The ambassador before the EU, Vicena:
Czechs have a reputation of negativists and euro skeptics.
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without a quarter."
"There will be five, six years before the situation is a little stabilised, calm, and the new players are used to their new roles," so it begins with conviction to their conference at the Czech Employment Faculty before the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How is it not seriously to take its "clear and openly on Europe", which has already said in the first part of its conference, when it was able to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, because it would be the invidiacy of many U.C. Rights Factory.
Vicenowa also reflected the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first is the critics, that if it is insulous, a grisy officer, who can take any role, but I must say he left all unconcerned, because he takes his roles to perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new position of representative of the External and Security Policy is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" It is therefore a important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union of States such as China and India.
Nobody wants us the Olomo's chess
Vicenowa has also been occupied with the continued agenda, continued and will follow the European Council in the future.
The Czech Presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs took care of the emergency economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summary for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which severely affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has now many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "good abortion", not only the presidency but also the financial crisis, which is now being treated.
On the other hand, the budget for seven years of the EU must be approved, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is more simple and effective, what sectors will have priority, what countries will receive greater support and what less? That is something that will be present in the next agenda.
The ambassador also recalled its main legumes, with which he arrived to Europe: "After Europe with clearness."
"The truth is that I don't like fucking abbreviations, foreignisms, or jewels that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels the pepines are not really invented curve or rounded pepines, platains of various sizes or that no one will bring us the Olomo's cup?"
It also intends to increase the benefits of the EU environment and to draw closer Czech citizens to European institutions.
We're waiting for Europe of speed
The ambassador is held, the Czechs have a fame of euro skeptics, and people more understand the negative aspects than the positive.
Moreover, he regreted the low participation of the Czechs in European institutions.
The fault is of many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their incapacity to write motivation messages, but also the small support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, he highlighted the force and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"I believe that when a Poland and a Hungarian come to me and come near a Slovak, a French to me says, "What, you have already left, those of the Visegrad Group?", and it seems that he doesn't have any grace."
In the future, in the EU, Vicenová, it is expected of new sustainable budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is seen as something very real about the concept of the two speeds, if they are no longer, in Europe, more than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen space and also have the strengthened cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time to cooperate only the countries they want and those who don't, that they stay out."
"These procedures will be more and will strengthen Europe at two speeds," expected by Vicenová.
In this regard, it also highlighted the role of Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, which all the issues affecting the entire EU should be discussed between Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM starts its second century of existence
If someone looks for a term that would determine the IBM strategy very precisely, the most closest would be "lange term".
For the general public, the IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is current and, however, has spent hundred years since its foundation.
The foundation of this longplacist character set it by the first head of the signature, Visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He already announced the lemma that many world problems have a solution if people are ready to think.
His lema "Think!" became his seal, and it will be building the life of the giant future (this also was the title of a internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised company culture.
"For us, IBM involves a long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for hundred years because he has remained faithful to his basic principles, but without fear of changes around.
This has allowed us to transform technologies, business and society during our first century.
We are expecting to prosper more in our second century," he warned during his birthday, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the Baťa businessman in Czechland (IBM employees were of the first operators and of those who enjoyed payable, safe, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system to the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication maintains IBM in the relationship with the client.
From the beginning, the company was able to discover talents (which was one of the first world companies at the end of any kind of discrimination, he could choose without problems).
On the line of the antidiscrimination strategy is the current IBM plan, so Palmisano will substitute it for the year that comes a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has already worked for 30 years in IBM, where she has been sales head, marketing and strategies.
In recent years, the IBM has participated in the called online meetings, a rain of ideas, which is infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprised that they are over ideas because they work almost a half million people in the signature.
An institution with good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM held a concept of institution more than technology company," the Economy Professor Harvard Business School and author of the book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that solves business problems for technological users," George Colony punishes by the Forrester Research consultant.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering business and creating just a business.
IBM - or "Green Green" - as known in the United States familiarly because of their logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world in the past hundred years.
It is possibly the most versatile technological company (the development of both equipment and programmes, infra- and web accommodation services within a broad range of services, which go from servers to nanotechnology).
The largest number of patents of all North American technology companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel Price.
Among their invents are the automatic box, pay cards, financial permutes, bar codes and diskettes.
IBM will make $220 billion this year. This year has become the second technological signature by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when he was first overtaken in 1996 to Microsoft.
Looking at the Future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied customers' pleasure and time (IBM has not been replaced by its own operational system, OS/2, prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on progress, it cannot be emotionally announced in the past," Samuel J. Palmisano recognized.
Therefore, IBM has no problems to build its bases on other platforms (and, if they do not work, leave them).
And that is the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls with Windows.
Future technology
In the field of sales, the IBM is especially dedicated to services, of which approximately one fifth is of programmes and another fifth of equipment.
However, in 1990, the teams represented more than half the percentage of the suppliers.
Since 2000, the IBM has sold lower performance assets for a total of $15 billion. In the same period, he has invested $58 billion in future technologies.
Investment has been followed since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis was opened for the first time.
IBM acts with the premises of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the large economic crisis of 29.
It seems that even now the IBM company has known to understand the crisis.
The value of IBM actions since the beginning of 2008 has increased strategy to 120%, and the net benefit of the company has not ceased to increase.
The IBM division is changing everything, except its value.
Therefore, it can be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from shortly of chess to space flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York 100 years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was already adopted in 1924 - originally a brand used in Canada and South America branches.
The basis that was given to the IBM's birth is from the merge of four companies that remont to 1880's decade.
He had invented such as the "ficking hour" that allows the input and output of employees to control.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided his supervisory advice until 1930.
Flint sent the leader of a company of competition, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader addressed the IBM founder (Watson's ideas continue to be the firm basis on which corporate culture and identity are supported).
Watson directed the company until 1952.
IBM, as indicated in its name, empe_ with the production and sale of all types of business equipment, from meat cutting and chessing to registering boxes.
It was the first four years that Watson led to the company, the facturation duplicated in 9 million dollars and the large extent of the company through the continents.
Watson was so crucial for the company that, nearly forty years after occupying the head's seal, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM emphasises to work in the development of artificial intellectuality and has developed the first programming language.
In the 60s, IBM staff and computers helped NASA to drive flights to space (to Mercurio, Saturno, and in 1969 the flight to Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "peces", which set up the computer standard at that time, arrived on the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its manufacture of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, from its part, purchased the Pricewaterhouse Coopers advisory part and began to offer a complete added advice and services.
The strategy that IBM has paid in the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, namely "a smarter planet".
Its objective is to make a more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned or have improved, for example, regarding transport and urban management.
For the trade sector, IBM presented the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows minorists to manage the full trade cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
In 1932, she opened a branch in Czech Slovakia from then, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the Strategy of Externalisation in Brno.
The seat for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. There is also a worldwide research team that works with voice recognition.
Richariat on your husband refiel:
Iveta, stay on that fat, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtář (53) said it's done!
After his husband Joseph Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lovers, Darina had the hope that Joseph would wake up from his rose dream and return home.
However, he will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can go home, but no longer as my couple," said Richtář.
When Darina Rychtářova accompanied Bartošov in her home during the summer, she couldn't even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Ričany and Pepe didn't leave the song.
He even declared publicly that he loved her.
With time, Darina rejected, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even rejected him forever.
Rychythar doesn't care with who his wife is accused.
If a day Richtář breaks with Bartošova, his wife wouldn't expect him at home with his open arms.
It's the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one's gonna throw it out."
"But here I would live no longer as my dear and old boyfriend who was wrong, but as a man to whom I was joined some links," Rychtářová said and appreciated that he had already disappointed her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Joseph still doesn't care that a woman has closed her back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife established this as a marriage on the paper and I respect it."
"The company remains in force, I do the household arrangements, I care for the garden, the house, I make the purchases."
"Darina and I talk normally, the only thing is that we don't lie," said Richtář.
If Richtář is a new love, he wouldn't resist.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't care about me, nor where he goes or if he has a boyfriend.
I know that it is my fault, I loved Iveta and I assume all the responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to quote some typical wives of women, in general each of them will appoint them without thinking.
Women, do you recognize you in the following lines, where some female victims are quoted that can make the men herd blood?
Go to purchase
Does he reproach your half-naranja that depends on the purchases?
Do you have to buy at least a trap per week?
Do you like to buy often in the boxes?
Then, in your case, you can say that you're going to purchase has become a vicious.
Some women realize that they should pause their passion for purchases at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the attempt to pass without more by the clothes of clothes, seek well-adaptated clothes and then try them all in the tester (ideally in all different colours)?
Although for most women go to purchase is a pastiempo, men can become practically a fever.
Just remember how many times you've already told your couple that you better wait for her in front of the door.
Constant Insatisfaction
"I'm not too bitter?"
"Will you need to deal at least five pounds - should you start exercising?"
"I really like you?"
Don't you sound these words?
What is it?
Then it's one of those women's aspects.
It is not that you should stop taking care of, but many men are allergic to listen to your couple to complain all the time of your physical aspect.
The strong sex is also agreed that as far as the frequency of complaints increases, more troubles return women.
Order and the first place
It's like an infinite thief.
Clear windows, pass the aspirant, break the ground, remove the dust, break the bathroom and all that at least twice a week.
Does he reproach his couple that he has weakened the ground with a sweet foot, his children who have shocked a recent lavabo and a steady with glass doors that so much costed him to?
If you suffer this "deviation", you would be aware that nothing should be oversaged and that order and destruction must certainly not be primary in the family.
This inofensive desire of delicateness could threaten their relationships and family welfare.
Make unappreciable comments
"The used calsons leave with the sweet clothes."
"You want to put yourself too tomorrow those used calcetines."
"The missed trap isn't left on the ground!"
If you make these cometars to your couple more times a day, you know that it will be able to get it out of your boxes.
Of course, you don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything okay.
Maybe, if men knew this, women would not make so many comments.
Columns and Chismas
Some women also have disappointments, chismes, but also offences and conspiration against someone.
Women focus on relations, so they like to talk together about things about who, where, who, who, how and why.
The best of each of us is sometimes a small and inoffensive kiss.
With the hand in the heart, this is self of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are chismous women who are not controlled, whom they love to smiley and often do it, who depart from all and are dangerous for those around them, especially in a female working team.
Yagr and Voráček helped with their assistance to win Philadel_a
The front of hockey Jaromir Yagr participated on Monday at NHL meeting with two assistances that brought the victory on Philadel 5:3 in the Carolina's candle and replaced the Czech players in the guard of competition.
In both cases Giroux used the 39-year-old star game, and gave another step and was declared the best player of the game.
Two assistants were adjudicated in the party and also Jagr's companion, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Yagr met the overseas journalists that Giroux had preached a great night.
"Before the game, I had told you that I would do three times."
"I had him."
"It sometimes looks like emboss," Jagr explained, after his action has given him a goal to Giroux, based on the first stretch of the Flyers.
Shortly later, the second intervention of the team also had a Czech trace.
Voráček was made with the disk behind the Urricanes portrait and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, which put gol.
A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was exhausted, but from the beginning of the second part, the Flyers were already dominated.
Concretely by Giroux.
After cooperating with Yagr, he hit the third gol, after his shooting was shot through the Wayne Simmonds port room.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean it's the best player of the candle, but it's certainly among the three best," Jagr weighed to his center.
"I would never have happened to me that at the end of my career I'd play with a sporter like him."
"I'm very satisfied with that."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my companions played for me, and that now produces results," adds Jagr.
Carolina still turned the party into a drama, with Tuom Rutu's gol and then again from Dwyer, of penalti, until he was put to a wallet remote.
Matt Read did not allow more complications, though they ended over in number of two against one.
"Pronger had a good action in our field."
"Show the disc, I took speed and Read went to the most remote part."
"I tried to reach the disk and I'm happy because I got it," Voráček described the last gol of the game as he lived.
With his victory, Philadela has been headed at the East Conference.
The Czech defensor of the Montreal, Jaroslav Spaček, did not play until the end of the party against Buffalo, in the second third, with a lesson on the top of the body.
The Canadians lost not only a player with a lot of experience in defence, but also by a difference between two goles, 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec wasn't able to use one of the shoots.
More than the lost points to the local trainer regreted the large number of lessons in the last row, and playing the game only with five defences.
"It's bad."
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest was new."
"End, but it is that nothing can be done against it, we have to handle it," Jacques Martin said.
"That rotating the players returned against us, we couldn't resist him."
"We had to simplify the game more, take the disk out of our field."
"And so let us leave rooms," explained one of the defendants, P. K. Subban.
Porter Ondréj Pavelec contributed with thirty interventions of Winnipeg at the victory of 5:2 on the Tampa Bay.
Jets' goals were marked by five players who thus ended a number of hurts that had already been held in five games.
How travel prices have developed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorised state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Chedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in most of the cases only to the socialist block, because traveling to O'e was very restricted.
The Czech tourists therefore went from vacations to the beaches of the RDA (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (ambas in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive emphasis was the period comprised between 1962 and 1972 when it was able to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslavia regime turned towards the west, and the travels of the Czech tourists were then very limited.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist block (or also the Czech Slovaks) would not be allowed to travel free and individually or by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed a invitation letter, if not, the individual travel was not possible.
The travel agencies also offered travels to the West at those times, but one should have placed the school with a sack of sleep and passed the whole night, or have "good known" in the agency.
I was still not all winning.
The called "switch promise" that was the with for the travels to the West, was not allowed to "politically little reliable people" that couldn't travel absolutely.
The Checoslovakian currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without exchange guarantee, it was unable to obtain the resources (the west currency) to travel to O.
The majority of the Czechs passed their vacations in their own country, so there was a large number of cabinets and houses of summer, which the Czechs bought. This custom you still persevered.
The way of traveling to the Czechs has suffered a true revolution since 1989.
While it was for us until 1989, it was not going to pass the vacations in the RDA or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation travels to countries worldwide.
It results in a great paradoge, which today we are not aware of, the fact that the current favorable destination, Croatia, was not able to travel freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia from then.
At the beginning of the 1990s, the exemption of visa was imposed to travel to the Neighbourhood States of Western Europe, which caused an enormous oil of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czech Slovaks, for a long time, did not see the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, check groups were sleeping in the parks in campaign tents, since our income from then did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the checks at that time was to take the food (conservates, embedded, etc.) to stop.
Another important moment was the introduction of the conversionability of the Czech crown, so our tourists finally could, after dengs, buy freely west currency.
Our level of life increased and with it the average salaries, which caused an increase in the request of travel.
Increasing the request for travel, the agencies began regularly, since 1997, to prepare travels using charter flight connections, which made the prices of travelling compared to the past, with the possibility of getting discounts for the volume of passengers.
At the end of the past 90th century, Czechs have already traveled without visa to almost all developed countries, except the US, which simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of the post-revolutionary tourism occurred in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge request, the first direct flight from Czechland to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct chatting with chekish tourists has been running from remote and calorous countries. This winter will be flighted directly from Czechland to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting them about 100 000 Czechs per year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States removed the views for the Czech tourists, thus our country was among the most developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have passed over the half of their vacations in the foreign (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have been spent on travels to the foreigner over 15,000 Czech crowns per head, including the expenditure on the station site.
Convocated General Ordinary Assembly to choose the President, which could end again at a dead point.
Since nearly five months, the Czech football has been without president and it is that the follower of Ivan Hashek as President of the Czech Federation of Futbol (FAČR) will not be known nor after the convocation of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, there has not been any agreement on the following rules of vote.
Without the same, it can not be voted if it is to choose among the three candidates.
The interested and presidented the Czech football are Jindrzych Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomás.
Hashek rejected his duty in June not before calling his colleagues to find a strong person who would like to take care of the football in the future.
However, after Hashek's era was concluded, there was a conflict between the two Federations of the unable association to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evidence on 16 September when the new president had to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly were gathered in vain in the National House (Narodní drum), pleued in the camp, because the discussions had been blocked and not only on the election method.
No consensus has been reached or had the right to vote at the General Assembly - only the legal representatives or the delegated with full powers.
Since that time and due to this unique point, a partial agreement, also supported by the Recommendation of the State and Right Institute, is that the representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes on the electoral code are still open.
More light on the situation could no longer be removed by the Executive Committee that, at its meetings, an extraordinary or extraordinary meetings, it could not solve nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has been changed a few times, but the neurological point is still the same.
The question is: How can we go in the third round to avoid the dead point?
"The dispute turns back to whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Presidents of the FACHR, which, from the direction of the association, represents the professional football.
The model proposed in the statutes, in the third round, will win the candidate with a greater percentage of support in the federalisation to which he will present its candidature.
The Region of Moravia is willing to reach a commitment to gain that candidate with a greater total percentage of votes in both federalities.
However, the Bohemian part implys that the winner, these percentage estimates, should have the majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, remove the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely refuse the concept of bicameral system," as Svoboda understands the objections of the resident party, if it would be the best to do not to the order and to vote is the applicable statutes.
This is, of course, also agreed to Tomash日lik, although the electoral regulation of all candidates is to be more agreed to Pelta.
"I would like to vote at the maximum in accordance with the statutes."
"In order to not find any foolishness about representatives such as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is first posted as candidate and who directs its observations mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimist.
It is he who will decide about the new president in Nymburk and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All patients will be paused with today's party of our national team in the European Campeonate.
"The football will again be a protagonist, and so it will be more pleasing to cooperate," the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in the management of football, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most renewable.
"I hope you'll come to an agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"It is not the conflict between bohemians and residents, but it is trying to adjust the rules to their own conviction."
"This may have a new blocking of the General Assembly."
"In any way, I hope that the common sense will be impressed," Rajchl said.
There's no longer a long time for all parts to come to an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be carried out in Montenegro, but who can know until the party starts if the football team is complete?
The special plane, where they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not come out this morning by technical problems in Prague, seeking an alternative to transport from the Executive Committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decision-making, finally, may be that which will take place at ministerial level, which, as they are counted, will be celebrated on Wednesday.
Joseph Dobesh, Minister for Education, Youth and Deports, would like to include parts divided into the most powerful sport organisation in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot in play: State subsidies, football credibility and also the next General Assembly of the Czech Republic of the Czech Federation Committee (CSTV) that will provide a new address to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka Lottery House.
It will fight for reaching the presidency because there is no more appropriate candidate.
If the leader of Pilsen's footballers, Tomash--lik, before the extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of a suitable candidate to meet all his ideas about the new President of the Czech Federation of Futbol (FAČR), it would not be presented as candidate to such a relevant position.
"If there were a proper person, I would be fighting for it and I wouldn't be candidate to elections."
"But until today, a person like this has not been found," said the Czech News Agency (CHTK)
What motivates Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl to enter the challenge is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the suspicious winner of elections, which opens the way to the Presidency of the Czech Federation of Futbol (FAČR).
It also puntualizes that, in the case of victory, it would remain at the president's office only until 2013, when the turnover of the General Assembly was reached.
In that responsibility, I would like to see a expert and good manager who is not too related to football attitudes.
"I've already spoken to some people I could take into account."
"For me it was a crazy hearing some say that at this moment neither would they want to identify themselves with the Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," adds.
The most molest to ́légik at present is the relationship of Pelta with the President of the Regional Futbol Association of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a controversy past, known outside the worldwide as a powerful lobbyist who is able to influence the vote of delegated at the General Assembly.
It is so inacceptable to see Pelta sitting on the presidential sillon.
"If you win, it would keep the current state and nothing in the football will change."
"with Berbra's support, a ambitious businessman, the football will bring even less profitable," he said.
It also refers to the fact that the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone hearing during the investigation of a case of corruption, from which Pelta was imposed.
"I don't know what football prestigition could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will EUFA and FIFA look at us," he said, "that also takes care of its previous statement that "the Club Pilsen would sell if Pelta became a president."
In the case of winning the elections of Thursday, cooperation with Pelta in the future could be raised.
It is the other candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by ́lik before the General Assembly of September that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one he would follow."
"It's very capable."
"I could imagine, for example, as a head of the representation."
"but not as a manager of a association."
"I don't also put the naes there where I am not able," added he, which in September took much attention to support the suspension of the Committee on Arbitros, presidented by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
̈k admits that the association would be attracted to the management of the association.
Return to its capacity of management of private companies, since since the past summer, he is also the Director of the Pilsen, who, with its support, held the triumph in the first division in May.
"I have power to change some things in the football area and to contribute to your safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of certain groups of pressure, which are probably intended to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appointment committee, producing disapproval, said ́likk without hiding its antipathies towards the President of Sparta Daniel Krzetinský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FACHR and the Czech Olympical Committee, with which he exercised pressure on political leaders to deal more money to the port of lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems to which the new president should be dedicated."
"If they increased taxes on azar games, as the political parties announced, they would support their arguments, but they should honestly tell us where they will stop all these money," he states.
Furthermore, you do not now take into account whether you associate with the Pilsner Club, although he himself, the President of the FACHR must be "not partial".
Pelta is at its time associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see the fact of ceder hypocritically my actions from the Pilsen Club to another person and then return there after a year and a half," he said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end with the dead point of elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Futbol Association, one of the candidates to the Presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if it was chosen, the FACHR would ensure that the FACHR had new statutes that would serve definitively to solve the discussions in the future with regard to the electoral regulation.
The representative of Jablonec is optimist about this Thursday in Nymburk, and he believes that the pre-electoral conflict could go to a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Before the elections not made in September, Pelta promised to be focused, if it was chosen, exactly on the representation and recovery of funds.
He decided to participate in the last minute at the latest General Assembly, so this two-month appointment could go well to defend and present its ideas on the management of football in a broader context.
"The people of all levels are busy for football a long ago and wait for this Thursday to meet the new president."
"It feels that the time has come to manage the association," thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in the Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
For this reason, you think you have enough experience to manage the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with elections is the eufory that reigned at Ivan Hashek's time.
"Lamente, at the General Assembly of June, the statutes which were not as perfect as they were all thinking."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civil Association was used as a signal to win the delegated.
"If they choose me, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to answer if this fails."
"It is a question of principles, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
Moreover, in theory, don't stand with your opposers.
In the past, he had warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, who respects his training in the right, knowing that his opposer would also be his first president.
He's been taking a long time without attacking Thomas ́lék who, contrary to Pelta, didn't let you titter with his head.
"It takes more than one year in the football world, and it has already achieved some success."
"Your attacks, but they were shameful, and many people were surprised by the electoral campaign."
"It is why many of them doubt about their real character," he said to his or her OO Pelta, who remains faithful to the declarations already announced in September.
His strongest weapon is, if he is, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the top.
This last should be avoided from football promotion.
"In addition, I would solve all scandals that occurred because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandale last year."
"I would immediately be involved in negotiations with the public sector and the private, to ensure that there is enough money for all the football," the 46-year candidate said to the CTK two months ago.
Then he also promised that its appointment as the President of the football would not have any personal change in the model.
"I should first know the tasks of each employee," he replied to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, it impides a comprehensive nervosism.
Despite the current catastrophe scenarios that are being vaticinated before the next General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel to Nymburk this Thursday.
"If the only point of disappointment is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"Futball needs credibility, which will be recovered only if you finally have a leader," two days before the most decisive day in your representative career, Pelta remains optimist.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FACHR would start working with wins.
If in the fourth General Assembly the current president Jindrich Rajchl is chosen as a new president of the Futbol Association of Czech, many would have been secured.
Rajchl promises that if it is chosen, it would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to resolve the case of the Bohemians, to improve EUFA and FIFA relations, to gain more money for football and to continue with the work started by former President Ivan Hashek.
"As the president, I'd like to devote me completely to the football."
"From international contacts with EUFA and FIFA to the selection, through professional football or high-effective young football training."
"I don't mean that I would do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview for the CTK.
"I am a team player and I want to share the powers of the Executive Committee so that each member may be dedicated to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can continue with a lot of impulse in each of these segments."
"To many people this will probably not like, because it will mean to start working very hard and not only criticize the work of others," he added.
As a result of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it is said that it has been considered the possibility of not again to be presented as candidate.
"All know that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will impedi me and obstaculize me at every step," he explained the reasons for their indecision.
"Multium people have told me I shouldn't be given for vengeance, because then they would be given for vengeance too."
"It's about to have faith so that you don't leave this way, without any more," said he.
It also motivates you to continue the work already started with Hashek.
"In those two years, a large part of the work that I don't want to lose now."
"There are processes that have been started and that they will have their effect within a few years and I would not like anyone to give them a father," he announced anxious about the fact that if they choose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be again as before Hashek's time.
"I believe in the order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to keep.
"There is over all those people who would take care of the football so that it would be only a privilege for a few chosen people."
"You can reproach me a lot of things, but not the fact that I am for someone."
"I'm trying to be target."
"I want to make a football for all, because only so will all feel well and not only the chosen," Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that only the President would be bohemian.
"Although some people have contrary, I'm in mind to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech and another residence, whose winners would go to the first division."
"The current situation in which we have only three Moravia teams, which represents a problem for young living players," Rajchl said.
Although at the fight of the presidential elections, Tomash ́lík, president of the Pilsner Club, Rajchl does not stop believeing in its possibilities to be chosen.
"I still feel to have strong support from the Czech Federation, which has chosen me as its President and who knows that there are clear successes behind me," Rajchl said, whose successes include the deal of some decades of millions of disvantageous contracts, television contract negotiations and the negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, you recognize your part of fault in which the federalization is not united.
And while calling that Pelta is "decalified to restore confidence in the Czech football", he considers the other rival, ́likk, as a strong candidate who has something to offer to the football.
"No one can refuse to do a great job for the Pilsen that year."
"If it is chosen, it will probably follow what Ivan Hashek has already empowered and would not significantly change the staff model in the committees."
"I don't want to use that for my favor," he evaluates his rajchl rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Switch to A
by Julia Stanek
Pescines from an incredible optical, fantastic bathroom in Budapest: Whoever visits Europe can live his wonderful life to it, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, relaxing his hot legs in burbuying bathrooms.
A book shows where the best welfare is located in the water.
When Iris Meder conducted a research travel during the last year and half, there was something that could not miss his team, a bathroom.
She was throwing backs over the water, looking at the cooling art on the top, swinging toward the marmol angels, waiting for it at the border of the pool, and shaking before the modernist pool that was restored meticulously.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his book at the time of all interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectural story Meder exploded more than 200 pools in this way and presented them in its recent book "Badefreuden": the pools in Munich, the historical bathroom palaces in the Black Selva, the "hormigon constructions" in Taunus.
Reali's "travel by the most extraordinary bathrooms of Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year Germany is a real enthusiast of the bathroom culture.
You don't want to have anything to do with the deport, says Meder, only water is different.
Only molesters to the bathroom have to be complied with blues and chlore heating, while those who are stuck to run can breathe the fascinating wheel of the beef forests or listen to the joyful trins of the birds in the park.
"Every day I wondered why the pools must always be so fascinated," this inhabitant of Vienna.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The chapoteo in the pool and the oil oil of the sauna. The well-being factor in the pools is so large because all feelings are attached, it is MEDER.
And if the builder strikes, the pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of the ground, there is a surface of water in the bathrooms."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is doubled optically: high bottles, color blues, trampolines.
The book with small "Badefreuden" format provides in 190 pages very interesting data on architecture and the history of art in the historical oasis of the well-being, but, mainly, it gives pleasure to go to a.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the examples listed in their research in Hungary.
Along with the magnified medical bathrooms such as the Bathroom in Budapest, 100 years old, waters with nitrates are located in a unique carst cavity (cave bathroom in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some terms, their pools are of alcaline waters and are located in a building in the form of bottle (Városi Termal birdö in Yašberény).
Many diarrhood pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While all the city places the eye in Zurich's soft pool, you can look at Arlberb, a snower, from the outer bathroom of a bathroom in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bathroom there is a window from where the practice can be observed in the ski tracks.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, expects clients in Längenfeld: The water cathedral of Ötztal seems to look like one or something that just lands in the Alpes.
From three open sources, the winter vapor ascends, while the mountains of Ötztal spring down in heaven.
Alhambra in the Black Selva
Meder, the pool collector, didn't invade chlore clore in all the pools.
Many thermal bathrooms flee to sugar, in the bathrooms of Arr`d in Békescaba, Hungary, the gasoline pestilence is so strong that people think have reached a healthy bathroom.
The olor comes from the medical waters containing bicarbonate and alcaline and which we are packing in the skin when we enter the pool, enjoying the well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder also was disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit pools and solar bathrooms in the Czech bathroom of Luhatschowitz, he met with a blocked terrain.
The bathroom of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed in 1902.
When Meder watched the demoroned windows of the modernist building red, white and yellow, he saw the male growing between the blue.
The defense was contrary in a pleasant pool in the Black Selva: the Termal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three stages of building after themselves; not only Neoromanic elements of their construction time in 1844, unless also an arabic Alhambra style Hall added in 1900.
Since his smered modernization in 1995, the Termal Palacio is the favorite bathroom of the pool collectionist, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural of the Black Selva.
"He has much deserved to merge different architectural styles in such a fantastic unit," Meder.
In such a palace the impression in the thermal pool is apparently not very important.
Agricultural Speculation
The Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of primary materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank reject his business with agricultural primary materials?
SPIEGEL-ONLINE information is given, Joseph Ackermann has charged a working group to check the consequences of speculation for poor people in the world.
In January, the consortium head wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, it is a study, 84 percent of the Germans seems not acceptable to speculate with agricultural primary materials such as wheat or milk.
Two thirds of the questionnaires require that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions are removed from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of an investigation due to the Foodwatch consumer organisation.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in the middle of October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that the bills on global primary materials are higher than prices, and the loans are charged with the responsibility of the world’s hunger problem.
Consumer defensor's campaign is directed concretely to Joseph Ackermann, the Deutsche Bank director, although the great ones such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, the staff on primary materials was considered to protect the trademakers from price oscillations.
The main experts agree that players have disconnected from offers and demands and gains from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann repeated the criticisms in different way than competitors and owners: He promised to revise the accusations and said that no business "measure to compromise the good fame of the Deutsche Bank".
Information about SPIEGEL ONLINE, a international working group is revising the complaints of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed at the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Directive, together with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the address will inform the consequences.
Finally, the business of primary materials could be reduced, or even their total abandon.
Ackermann's fitting your picture.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but repeated its critics to the financial sector: "The growing prices of food are particularly drasticly showing how the sprayed ones actually harm the public welfare."
Ackermann is as the largest capable, especially in the obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all the investments of his portfolio in which it plays money for food prices," Bode advised.
"It's the same thing if Ackermann handles the theme of the people who are hungry or the fame of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first view, but it is clear that the consortian boss wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leave his position.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank published that the President of the Joint Directive would change something different than not planned in the Administrative Board.
With the abandon of the controvertised agricultural speculation, it can perfect its image.
And you need only to be interested in possible losses, that will take care of your successor.
Two thirds would cancel investment in primary materials
Foodwatch strives to maintain the pressure on the manager.
To this moment, more than 30,000 internautes have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the investigation for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1.001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 per cent considered legal that the Deutsche Bank offered investments in which the prices of food were placed.
Many customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their shared in such businesses: if the investigation was, two thirds would cancel all investments from which money from the agricultural speculation.
43 percent would unconsequently disappoint a so-called advice to their people, 49 per cent would ask, after reflecting, to cancel their account and to change to another institution.
House 21 in Vienna
The Pavilion After
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with highways and a happy end, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 received premiums, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and demourned.
Now it's repeated as a house of exhibitions.
The architecture of modern postgerra passions, clear forms, cristal halls, courageous curves and new building materials, typical thoughts about technical progress, so the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 universal exhibition of Brussels is a suitable and known example.
The Swanzer Pabellon then obtained the Grand Architecture Prix for its light and floating steel construction.
Construction is too considered a contemporary hito of architecture.
He made the so known architect that also built the Austrian pavilion in the next universal exhibition.
With his legendary tower of four cylindres for MBW more the adjacent building planned in Munich, it has been internationally known.
His pavilion, designed as a temporary building for exhibitions, arose after the universal exhibition in the Schweizer Garten at the South Station of Vienna, reformed in 1962 and inside a 20th century museum, called the "house 20th".
The building was adequate, but there was no space and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to cover art or a good environment.
However, it is used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new house.
The building has been empty since 2001 and has decreased more.
Currently, the Adolf Krischanitz architect reformed the pavilion, now calls it "Home 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Wednesday afternoon the belveder museum, who belongs to the house, with the first exhibition, was a lot of happiness in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belveder since 2007, reached a new start.
Husslein-Arco, doctor in the history of art with a considerable career, among other things, patina artificial on ice in her youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and the funding director of the modern art museum in Salzburg, performed reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, offered public funds and private patrocinators and established its use.
In the context of the contemporary art, the works of the Homosexual Foundation Fritz Wotruba, should have a cafeteria and a library and also build a office building.
Strength control, lower budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he was sensiblely reformed by Joseph Olbrichs' sequence in Vienna, he extended it and adjudicated the concurrence, unless it was because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Vienna Technical University and the pabell was for him a "important and large place", in which he intended "almost all weekends" exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its exchange of use with generosity and facility.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "a energy consumer", Krischanitz said.
The profile of the crystal fascicle windows was changed, a island cristal strengthened with glass fibre was installed and the weight of the cristal was replaced by a special security cristal.
Thermal powers and steel boxes were strengthened or replaced and the amiant tissues rehabilitated.
Two soldiers were used for the new use, a light panel between the house and the street provides illumination, a pool serves to enter the nearly new building, but still the Swanzer pavilion.
Stay outside doors, the house is painted in old caoba tons and protected against oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the Office of monuments and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, beautiful and also liked the Office of Protection of monuments," and warned you of an aspere ground in the sothan.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and easily.
The pavilion "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, has recently afflicted Krischanitz, a typical "apparition ca" in the history of the city.
A architecture like this is "always in the wrong place" and therefore he wanted to "wake up the appropriate conscience".
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, it has occurred a hit of urbanistic happiness. The completely new and planned "barrier of the central station", with residences and offices, is located at Schweizer Garten.
And maybe another happiness struggle: House 21 could receive a refuer from another building of Krischanitz, because Francesca von Habsburg Collectionist has bought the Berlin Temporary Art Room and, as it is heard, negotiated with the city on a neighborhood place in Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that rises to millions
The company has idead a crisis plan that would avoid the winter trains.
• Double the number of staff.
What's costing a million.
In the fight against the delays and delays of trains caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros in this year, a periodistic report is made.
The "image" magazine informed, calling on a internal crisis plan from the group, of the investments planned up to 2005 of a total of EUR 300 million.
In order to achieve better employment of vehicles and railway networks, even in extreme times.
Among other things, internal and external employees are planned to double 16,000 places to remove the snow from the roads and the Andens.
The objective is to set up snow and ice and 90 per cent of the needed aigle for the operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, announced delays and delays in the trains also during this winter after a summary with the government and industry.
The last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of travellers, since, among other things, he missed reservations against adverse conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorisation of the federal railway office.
Moreover, there is a delay in the delivery of high speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn works for years in checking the high-speed train axes of frequency on the tower, after a high-speed train would suffer the rotation of an axis at the central station of Colonia.
The Deutsche Bank pays millions in the United States.
After the tumult on President Joseph Ackerman, there appears a new problem of the US, the Deutsche Bank must pay a million.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the United States add to the sector's giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in an agreement to end the contents due to five large credit cooperation during the financial crisis.
It is the sale of hypotechary titles.
NCUA's financial market regulations re-employed to many big ones to introduce credit partners with promises to buy financial products; the risks have been minimised.
Such titles lost their value during financial crisis and dragged the depths to depths.
"We are satisfied that we can announce the issue without that the parties need to come to courts," said a German Bank portfolio in New York.
It does not admit any fault with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which obligationed a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, observed the decline of both financial institutions.
National Credit Unionation (CUA) is responsible for US credit cooperation and provides support in case of cheap to protect customer investment.
NCUA reintegrate the losses of millions of origin.
The currently closed agreements are its first type.
The regulator had also requested accounts for other large and summerly against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of doubts of hypotechnical titles, they are the called values supported by hypoteques.
These are based on resident credits.
When the U.S. immobiliary bubble was stuck in 2007, it led to many financial matters.
In September 2008, at the critical point of the financial crisis, the investment and - Lehman Brothers were lost.
Although the results had occurred a few years ago, it currently survived a complicated wind for people and women.
Investors and inspectors have established incontable processes to receive compensations or to sanctify deficiencies.
The Federal Life Financing Agency (FHFA in its centuries in English) has produced the maximum number of requests.
The 18 major international agencies are reproached that the two State hypotecary agencies and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have benefited from the hypoteques' business at a volume of approximately 200 billion dollars.
The Deutsche Bank also has a request for FHFA, it is a business of 14,2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires that the Frankfurt Institute responds to "the substantive losses" without a precise number.
The Deutsche Bank 日 debts as infunded and explained that he wants to defend himself.
Warren Buffett contributes to 10 billion IBM
The Guarantee of Finances, Buffett, is strongly invested in the IBM Information Technology Company.
Since March, a value of more than 10 billion dollars has been acquisited.
Until now, the large American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or information technology because long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read the IBM commercial report and has changed its opinion on investment in the sector.
He had to understand much before IBM offers services and searches for computer systems for other companies' Information Technology Departments.
In the financial world, a warren Buffett investment is considered a honor.
Therefore, the primacy of Information Technology should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has currently shown in the CNBC economy farmer who has bought IBM actions for a value of $10.7 billion since March.
Your Berkshire Hathaway of investment has reached one of the largest IBM investors with a participation of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM did not know anything about the commitment until now.
He was entitled to the direction of the benefits of the economic crisis.
"They have done a great job," Buffett advised on the strategy.
IBM has already established the services of profitable information technology such as the functioning of calculation centres.
The old informatic pioneer of more than 100 years also provides software and advice as well as powerful teams for companies.
Buffett avoided technology companies until the date.
He said it would only invest in companies whose business would understand.
In contrast, Buffett used the opportunity in a train of goods, in a manufacturer of or a mechanical engineer.
Your Berkshire Hathaway has approximately 80 own branches, as well as part of a series of large consorties such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Back.
Buffett, 81 years old, was charged by the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company in 60 and, with wise investments, extended it to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet, his lifestyle is humble.
That's why it's an idol for innumerable investors of all the world.
Your fast and unfair sense to win money has given you the supername of "Omaha's orakule".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's actions in the box ascended one percent.
"The giant a," as IBM is known, has a value of more than 220 billion dollars and, together with Apple and Microsoft, between the world's most valuable technological companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett, he doesn't want to cooperate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish communications media doubt about the German law state.
A magazine speaks of a "blood ideology" that is again renewed.
Eight-Small Business Measurement Measurements between 2001 and 2006 have a transfer of the extreme.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin has been renewed with fear and concern for this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a fantasm that was thought dead ago, since the attacks in the form of incendies in Mın in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 had no more violence episodes with extreme inflammation against Turkish.
However, it has never been questioned that in Germany there is xenophobia.
The ultra-direchist network shows a magnitude whose dimensions were not, or much less, pre.
"Does the blood ideology again?", entitled and on the Internet of the Turkish magazine "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" highlights the contrary that one of the criminal authors was an informant of the Constitution's Federal Defence Office and is concerned about the fact that the German authorities could be involved in the ultradirectist bagnale.
The Turkish community in Germany reopened sensiblely, the end of the week reminded the victims of racist violence with a watch at the Brandenburg Port.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with the German and Turkish politicians, reflected in a solemn act of the fifty anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The constantly placed on a scene with joyful colors, like a story with a happy end.
The information arrived to some Turkish media as a bofetada: "The German gift for the fifty-year-old", says the title of a article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", renewed it to the trash of the murder chain.
The German "Hürriyet" emission also does not insist on drawing this mental connection.
"Beginning to eat bad," says the title of the Ahmet Külahci column.
Highlights that the murderers were people who paid their taxes and made a significant contribution to their work to the rebuilding of Germany.
In the forums of Germans of Turkish outcome, police behaviour and their later success in searches are very critically discussed.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not so much before suspicious in the ultrade circle.
Someone shows the less retorical about the drastic media: "From now here, immigrants are lost but self-defence and weapons."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany is strongly depending on the quality of statement and adjustment of sanction to the entire network." "Selen".
What means that, if Germany's internal peace is in danger, M. Solingen's attacks will be declared in nineteen years.
The image of the ruins of the incendie of Solingen has been found in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed clearer to the Turks who live here that there is a specific threat and, to the Germans, that disloyalty and distantness can be deployed in violence.
The attacks aggressive the feeling of a group of the Turkish party.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, the deficiency of German politics was criticized mainly after attacks, Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mõn.
After the attentioned in the form of incendium of Solingen, he sent a telegram to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his Minister for Foreign Affairs, replaced it in Colonia's funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks contributed to taxes.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated.
The current information of the Turkish media again shows how deep it is, since then, the disloyalty of many Turkish Germans of origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the efforts of a broad explanation and revaluation of extreme terrorism in Germany, this time there are no French words.
The scandal of Zurich Lake
Europe's most riskable risk is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
UBS has almost entered into the financial crisis and since then has been removed from a crisis to the following.
Now a German leads her.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought so.
After its spectacular department from the summary of the Federal Federal, in July, it was known that it would begin in 2013 in a new and almost even a spectacular work: President of the Grand Administrative Council of the UBS, an unexpected and profitable step in its career.
Axel Weber rejoices publicly, Switzerland praise for its beauty and UBS for its recent acquisition of solidity and lets friendly observations fall on their future companions.
"The USB has reached a revitalisation."
"I'm glad to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it was clear that everything would be totally different.
A financial USB operator in London avoided all security systems and decreased EUR 1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, the USB General Director, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the administrative advice of the USB has since then been considered equally touched, and everyone asked: What does Axel Weber come?
Weber had to advise the advice since February 2012.
And it will be responsible for the chairmanship of the administrative advice in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the communicated on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
It is not a banker, rather, teacher of economy and adviser and has had a period of adaptation certainly necessary.
It becomes responsibility for a strategy, which has just been once again to prove that it deserves the title "the greatest of the scandal of Europe" for a long ago.
On the one hand, the USB is a huge, even a little while it was the largest world property administrator, and, on the other hand, since years ago, it has gone from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, so it seems, is too proud to your forehead.
Eat financial crisis.
The USB had an excellent fame until 2007.
The image of the property administrator was discreet and solid but also mad, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number of investments.
On the one hand, with 1.6 billion dollars, the USB manages more money from added customers than any other part of the world.
And on the other hand, Avan is as an investment in the liaison of the big world.
That's impressing.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professeur in Zurich for many years, explains: "From my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good."
"From the current point of view, one asks, "How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, something went out to the light that something went very bad in the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, Director-General, which was even considered a genial and very intelligent banker, issued extraordinaryly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The investment fund was shiped in losses with high risk titles and had to amortise thousands of millions.
To load this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this, he found investors, of course, that some looked with disappointment so much before: a Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and an arabic, so discrete, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first hit.
In April 2008, he embedded.
It had to declare the loss of thousands of millions, Marcel Ospel, president of the Administrative Council, in 2006 in the second best paid administrative advice of Switzerland.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investment, the UBS was found in the financial crisis in front of the cheap and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bought UBS difficult values for many thousands of millions, and the Helvetic Conference gave six thousands of francs for a mandatoryly convertible good, through which it became a copropiationary of the community.
All Switzerland was affected, the dramatic thing this was for a small country, if it was so large to them.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance in 2007 was more than five times greater than Switzerland's economic results (see graph).
"We can't rescue UBS again," said Geiger, expert in .
At the first catastrophe the second was joined.
A few months later, UBS captured a fiscal conflict with America and was ready to deliver the data from the added customers, which had probably defrauded taxes with the support of the customer.
Furthermore, he approved a number of $780 billion, repayment of unjustified benefits from these businesses with a payment compensation.
The UBS has therefore admitted more or less assistance in tax fraud.
Simultaneously, he lost something that had been his capital forever in competition for rich customers: the discretion aureol.
After the scandal, the secret of the secret is no longer the same.
This followed the dismission of the President of the Joint Directive and of the President of the Administrative Council.
And the exode of customers' funds.
In this way, in a few months, the employment lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment through wrong speculations and in the administration of goods through aid to tax fraud.
And just when I was going back to be something quieter, just when I thought UBS was going to get it again, this disgusting story of the operator occurred, a individual operator decreased 1.7 billion euros before the UBS realized that something was wrong.
And, of course, this has not yet worked well with risk management in investment.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little," Martin Janssen, Professor of Economy and Finance at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The Financial Director of a Great German is also safe: "The problem of UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls."
So the idea of caution, with which the bankers have been present for a long time, to be the guardians of the greatest goods in the world: no too big risk, rather, money security wants to break the other side of the Alpine Republic.
The security deposits of their owns were the symbol of inquebrable reliability, such as Lintt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate.
The UBS center in Zurich does not match the private solid cliche of its, only a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
It has its main seat on the Bahnhofstraße street of Zurich, which goes from the main station directly to Zurich Lake, marked by the snow-snow covers of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are hostile, the winners are one of Europe's highest.
Here are joyries like Tiffany's between traditional businesses their terms as the confession of Sprüngli.
Here are years ago their own lives: from nationality, passing through the Credit Suisse palace, up to the private ones such as Julius Bär.
It enters the UBS receipt room through a heavy girdle door.
Inside the walls are dressed with marmol, in front of large skin siles, at the logo of the logo there is a large letter to indicate the "security".
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: Security.
The two biggest ones, UBS and Credit Swiss, at some time have moved the idea of the great one, or have betrayed it, as the president of a small private private person thinks.
It prefers not to read its name in the magazine, at the end and at the end, as all bankiers do, also with both large businesses.
UBS has become too large, thinking, mainly in investment, where the Anglossians have gained land.
There's nothing more to say.
"And they have been used for a long time to the customs of the English."
In fact, UBS changed the investment in England, delivered its first great profit and then came to the disaster, no European financial employment had lost both money in the jungle of high risk and the great risk of it.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was evident.
"This Wednesday the governmental coalition of the small country of seven million decided the greatest redemption operation in the history of his nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" (The UBS crash) in Spanish.
The politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the large road.
How's it going to happen to them?
It is spoken to bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large parts of them were joined in a powerful consortium.
It comes too large for the small Switzerland because of the fusion, and it continues to grow.
So it served to supplement the two different UBS pioneers: a rich but sleeping with the centre of the administration of goods in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalisation.
Immediately, the internationalized investment facilities arrived with a lot of money, with which they could make a huge financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this UBS surface: Peter Wuffli, UBS consortium head of 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative advice.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says the expert in Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modesty, which understands many models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that has been able to open a step from the employment in the  skuld to the summary."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And at the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive error: "He thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, the breakfast came before the case.
UBS employees are clearly agreed on the directoral meetings, where Wuffli, the consortian head, always repeated the same lemma: Down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American is the most powerful investment in the world.
The "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the League Tables.
UBS wanted to be at the top.
Some steps went out well.
In the division operations and in the negotiation of action, it was the highest.
However, responsible companies' advisers pointed out a weak point: In the international interest business, in the "fixed income language", there is a huge compensation for the majors.
UBS is empty in American hypotechary products.
To fill these empty ones, UBS eats an aventure that almost costs her existence.
Increasing, they invested both the same and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk investment investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to hold American hypotechnical credits and then sold them, maintaining certain risks at its own account.
And also, as others looked for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was in fire, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, expert in Others.
So big euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to go, because the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
The posts in the UBS have become projective seats and are uncertain until now.
Currently, who is a great man, has a almost impossible job.
Find a strategy for a business, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, expert in them, has a idea, put an end to investment, focus on the administration of goods, return to the Swiss roots.
It doesn't want to come so far (a.k.).
But investment has to decrease much, it is clear now.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the House, will present its future strategy to the world.
In fact, he was only thinking about the Italian-su- 51 years as a transitional solution, since the Ireland was extraordinaryly separated from his former Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed:• permanently directing UBS businesses, communicated Zurich's house on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to invest in his state at the middle of the nineteen.
Remove 3.500 places.
But this isn't enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's it?
What do you want to win money?
These are the questions that sure Axel Weber is now.
Until the moment it's just saying that you'll first look for a living with your wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Warren Buffett, the legend of investment, confirmed this precaution only, yet it is not clear whether Europe is sufficiently strong to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he has been involved in an interview for the CNBC.
It is therefore too quick from its view to invest in state or European loans.
Instead, it throws a dee of old principles through the border and enters the technical and technical sector.

Intelligent degrees are spread in cities
In many places the degrees are considered "problematics": these intellectual animals from the cities are not expelled for a long time, experts.
Some people like, others want to be quickly released from them, the degrees belong to the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the compulsions of neighbors are collected by the beast and the noise of animals.
Although there has not been any means against the "problematics" until now.
The degrees are no longer out of the cities, experts in the first symposium on degrees in Leer, East Frisia.
There specialists of all the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Search alternatives in towns
Citizens attribute cities' problems to the field of certain protected degrees; chemical applications in agriculture end traditional vital spaces.
The jail, the growing building and the fall of trees that host them difficult the lives of birds.
The degrees are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 playing couples in Soest, Westfalia, among others, northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, the negative holders of the press had a controverse project to kill mass at the degrees of the press.
Critics have qualified the cattle of animals through traps for birds and killing with dogs as particularly brutal.
"Expuls them and hide them normally." Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscape of Leer demonstrated.
Shoot with water to the nids or throwing the trees are undetermined consequences, also Manfred Kaiser, a environmental expert in Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals depart, the large colonies of dividing and distributing in other places."
Ahuyen's only imaginable as hospitals, older residences or college residences.
"We must live with them, we don't catch them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, Master of Leer.
A combination of resorting to animals of sensitive and tissue residential areas is possible to sit again in other places.
"Information panels instead of chains" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychological and etnological, makes publicity against the purpose of treating animals in a completely different way: "The best is that we can endure a pick on the face with aplomo."
Jürgens confunded Schleswig-Holstein the learning circuit on Ascheberger's degrees, where letters inform about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgen also has its own opinion on the critics for the noise of the birds: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
The intellectual and ability of these animals are legendary, the degrees not only use the resources for squisite bottles, unless they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambria have checked four degrees until the intellectuality of birds comes.
In an experiment, the birds had to quickly let a stone fall on a platform so that they could reach a poll larve.
Without much training, they determinedly recognize the size and the way it should have the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, degrees of degrees were to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a poll larve in a vertical cilindro.
The birds couldn't come to their capture with their pig.
But the researchers left them a piece of flames.
With which the four animals made a bowl, with which they fished the cube in the tube tower.
Three of the four degrees made it in the first trial.

Personal Masacre
The intense and generous new book of Peter Englund, the beauty and pain of the battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "starts with a long dramatic person of the type that can make one fall the soul to his feet.
Here are some action advice: Start this page slowly and turn it into your page mark.
It will come to know these people very well in the news of Mr. Englund's newspaper, and this dramatic person will work as its GPS, a fair during those few moments in which, as one of your men and women, is confused and departed in the war's cloud.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish A.A., which grants the Nobel Price of Literature.
What you have written here is a little running book, which describes, certainly, as "a anti-history work".
It contains some notable names, important or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions on tactics or materials.
It's not so much a book about what happened, explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about " feelings, impressions, experiences and states of humor".
"The beauty and pain of the battle "combines experiences in wartimes of more or less than 20 men and women, both sides of the war, from college and botanics to scalers, doctors, ambulance and administrative leaders.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become war prisoners, or their members, become crazy or die.
Her lives parpaded here as voting wheels in a church; some news are added to the mixture while others disappear.
The book of Mr. Englund is a deviation of the standard history books.
It is also a corrective idea that the First World War was only the funeral war of trinchers in the west front.
"The beauty and pain of the battle" is moved expertly to other war teatres: the Alpes, the Balkans, the east front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the colmen; one passes the Christmas in Egypt under the pyramides; tse-se mosques are an intratable problem.
This is a moving book, almost since the beginning.
War inunds the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a Katrina Uranian who deceives the court.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with your children, are you staying or escape?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one understands what's going on, or if he does not want to fight this war.
"Carence of facts," observed Mr. Englund, "he has been filled with conjections, suppositions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, theories of conspiration, dreams, weights and sounds."
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, a English army in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German mariner of the high sea float.
His stories have been obtained in most of their memories, letters and other materials already published earlier.
The explanations of your lives may be terrified or confused, but they are more full of life in the cumulation of small moments, lost details than Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about privacy and arranging them with what is there.
About accounting the story of a German college says, "Sucedanei, everywhere you happen."
"Success of coffee, aluminium, imitation gome, paper sales, wood buttons."
She continues talking about the food that occurs in Germany.
Describes "meat made from cooking and pressed in herb fat (and completed with a tree-worked bone); tobacco made of roots and dry packages; coats with tree sockets".
There are, note, "837 meat substitutes allowed in the production of salt, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and value.
A American recognizes his own impulse towards salvageism and manifests about war: "It feels that, after all, this is for what men are conceived and not to sit in sillons with a cigarette and a whisky, the evening journal or a best seller, and pretending that this babysitter means civilization and that there is no barbar behind that shifted and tachoned peak."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will hear or import him.
"When one rejects the thought of being sacred, one would like to think that it could happen before the public," he wrote.
Instead, it's horriblely like "a condemned being stripped in secret".
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become more economic competition," says Mr. Englund, "a war between factors."
Reflects on the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the young animal of the century: The murderer in famous mass and ideologically convinced with good confession clothes that execute his carnicy while sitting behind a desktop".
People behave in unpredicted ways; there is both innoble and heroic behavior.
Mr Englund speaks of soldiers who actively have taken a venerous illness of prostitutes as a way to avoid the service in front.
"The biggest expression of this can be seen the trade of pu punococic, which soldiers buy and embedding with it their genitals with the hope of finishing in the hospital," writes.
"They who are truly unexpected strike him on their eyes, which often gives place to a blinder of life."
In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose, but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, war reflects the way to "decisively incontrolable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about the First World War often have been indirect, such as the Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or newslevels like No Newness in front of Erich María Note, instead of integral stories.
Mr Englund's volume is joined to a low conventional panteon.
Your book has one of the most devastating ends that I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he'd come from his book, cut off from your fingers that page of dramatics persone, and I'd burn it with a circle.
After a previous step, a planned attack per minute
Hundreds of police agents were involucrated, some of them carrying antidisturbations.
It was chosen on Monday night on Tuesday because the Zuccotti park would be more empty.
The operation remained secret for a few high rango officers, initially speaking to the other who were joining an exercise.
The police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underlined how the operation was painful for the police department.
The recent week-end episodes could not be repeated, such as pumping spray pulverization on manifestants, infringing the department's standards and creating a public sympathy storm towards the "occupations".
Therefore, the police operation to clear the Zuccotti park of manifestants was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had been prepared to see how occupations were developed in other cities.
An older catastrophe simulation was going on in Randalls Island, with an eye looking at Zuccotti.
The agents increased the calling distress training - anti-terrorist measures that involved rapid mobilization to a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the side of Manhattan of the East River.
The orders to enter the park arrived in the " last minute", said someone acquainted with the orders, which were referring to the mission only as "a exercise".
"To the little police I know they were called for this, they didn't tell them that it was to enter the Zuccotti park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew that they would enter the Zuccotti park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secretism was a lesson from the city.
On October 14, some agents wanted to clear the park, but they rejected when hundreds of manifestants came before a while after hearing about the plans.
The operation of Tuesday involved agents of several police units, including special forces of the entire municipality - tens of mobile agents that usually were inunding the high-kriminal barriers.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, were going and coming from the park during the day, doing a good hour to enter.
"It was appropriate to do it when it was the smallest number of people in the park," he said.
Camions of the Emergency Service Unit with focus and highvoces were gathered in the Pike Slip cross with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan's pool, before exiting.
The lights and pre-grabed messages that retreated from the highvoces seemed to intimid many manifestants.
The Community Agencies went to the park with their clearly covered coverages, many manifestants simply collected their things and went away.
No tent was touched until 1:45 a.m., said the police, giving time to demonstrants to collect their belongings.
Other agent teams were seen to meet themselves in the perimeter to enter if there were arrests in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave him.
Paul J. Browne, the leader of the Department of Police, said it was for his security.
But many journalists said that it was trying to avoid the police to enter the park into action, and that the agents had been brokenly treated.
Mr. Browne said that the mobile television units at Church Street, along the west border of the park, could catch images.
As the police moved towards the west to the density of the manifestants' personal effects, including paper and plastic bags, they followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some manifestants who refused to move were arrested outside, showing images on the Internet shortly later.
A central group of manifestants took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the centre of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police entered to arrest them methodically.
In around 10 people in the camp's epicenter, they switched between them by their arms.
And two people were bound to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The agents of the emergency service were called to cut the candates.
There were no arrests at the park even at 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The departure operation was complete about 75 minutes later, said the police.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were "changing the public order and resistance to the authority," he said.
The highest rango agent on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the superior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Department Detective Boss, was there also.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "he was not directing the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents expected the east side of Broadway, between the streets Liberty and Cedar, if they had to enter.
They arose barricades on the Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on the Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, he saw the police expanding the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti park.
At a given time, a series of agents, many of them with scrutiny, were seen by shopping people outside.
There were approximately 28 people in the north area.
Some of the loudest acts of the night had happened south of the park.
At 5 p.m., south of the Pine street, a manifester sprang on the head of a police car, and others were seen by removeing the air from the roads of a police car.
At a given time, a piece of contracade flew from the multitude.
Finally, a agent and a manifestant were hospitalized.
The staff's worker's office will request the city for the exemptions
The syndicat representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their employment last month plans to request the city on Wednesday, claiming that the exemptions were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools to poor students.
The request is, probably, the last weapon available to the syndicate, of the municipality 37, in its efforts to revoke the exemptions.
Seventy-sixty-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the worst payed in the city lost their job on 7 October, in a movement that the sindical leaders have described as a political vengeance for their negative to allow, the past, the city's access to a healthy assistance fund to work groups to close their budgetary breakdown.
The municipal authorities have categoryly refused that accusation.
In an audience at the Assembly last month, the educational adviser, Dennis Walcott, said that the exemptions were part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the Council argued by saying that nothing in the budget indicated that members of the school support staff would be dispedid.
The officers of the municipality 37 said that they submitted the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be requested. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official application at the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
The request will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Civil Education as accused, and account for eight disfellowshipped employees, all of them black or latin women, as well as the majority of those who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, portrait of the town legal department, said that the city hadn't seen the demand and thus could not make comments on its specific claims.
It is a removal of the request obtained by The New York Times, the syndicate has focused on the number of exemptions in the poor areas of the city to support an injust treatment claim, saying that the poor schools have lost more assistance, since they have been insufficiently subvented chronicly.
It is noted that although there were no exemptions in Staten Island and a few in schools at the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the 23th district in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were lost in the 8th and 9th districts of the Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the question says, "This is not a campaign of added parents who can recover funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. The budget of the 36th budget was reduced to 3.26 per cent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate the additional financing for each poor student in schools.
The syndicate also that secondary school directors may have been misguided by the language in a memorandum that allows the exemption of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "excedent" to describe the action, although "excedent" describes more frequently the act of transferring to a teacher of a school's nominal to a workboat, whose sales are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents coordinators were dispedid," said the worstman of the complaint, "and not only in the dead."
Mission completed, the Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
It seems that the Republican and Democrats in the Capitol are finally willing to agree on something related to the rise in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion succeeded, that the veteran dictator Muamar the Gadafi was captured and killed and the participation of the United States reached its end.
On Tuesday, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate will consider a resolution, patrocinated by President John Kerry (democrated by Massachusetts), together with senators John McCain (republican by Arîta) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent from Connecticut), applauding the libios for his successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "valence".
"This resolution is to honor the courageous in Libya, beginning to rebuild its country," Kerry said.
"It is a bipartist support for its democratic attitudes."
The language may seem inappropriate, but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easily until now.
This summer, the legislators of both parties were fighting between themselves and the White House on the editing of a series of resolutions to approve or embrace the role of the United States military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The draft law was destroyed in the Chamber by a wide bipartid margin, which has never come to vote in the Senate.
However, on the same day the draft law was raised in the Chamber, the camera also was a measure that would have covered the funds for operations and operations in Libya.
That left the United States mission in a kind of legislative purification - with the Congress as adequately disturbing as to criticize the management of Obama of the mission, but not as angry as to actually follow the grass under its feet.
The Congress's indecision was then overcome by the advancements.
Thripoli fell in the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was murdered on 20 October.
The NATO mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs " congratulates the people of Libya for their great courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "Elogy to men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their partners of coalition who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionality."
The resolution also "declares the United States' national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure be fully supported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or will it share the legislators as the draft law of June?
The last version was set by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the main Republican of the Committee.
The Logar Porter said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law project.
On the other hand of the Chapter, the Chamber will vote this week on a constitutional amendment by a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republican congressors and some democrats.
The measure, patrocinated by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually reaches a vote of the entire assembly in the Chamber or the Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded until now to make their amendments to the assembly, but not because of the lack of efforts.
Goodlatte is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments introduced in this Congress, which cover a broad range of them.
Some are duplicated - the same draft law is proposed both in the Chamber and in the Senate - and others with light variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment to the budget balance only in the Chamber, and another pointed out that "the federal expenditure will be controlled".
Some of these law projects are also identical, but they give their patrocinators - especially new Republicans who are seeking to refine their curriculums - the opportunity to get out that they were the "even" of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was approved in August, requested that both the Chamber and the Senate vote for a amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 Senators voted for an unbinding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Besides the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that the members of the Congress can comply, while the representative José E. Serrano (democrate by New York), wants to remove the limit of two mandates for the Presidents.
The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (democrated by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to a quality education and health care, among other subjects.
A amendment that prohibits homosexual marriage is a permanent proposal, as well as a prohibiting flag fire.
Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are two-thirds of the state.
So enthusiastic that members have been at the time of proposing amendments, they are not moved to a faster time than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and 66 in 110.
The rate is inacceptable in comparison with the 1990 de de 1990, when members regularly presented more than 150 amendments each two years, the numbers provided by the Senate Library are described.
But they did not have much more success then than they had now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th was in 1992, but it was actually proposed by the Congress in 1789.
"Golped but not wounded," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview from the tiroteo
Ten months after a gunman shot him to fire in a act constituting in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (democrate by Arına) appeared on the national television on Monday night, sing with Broadway's melodia "The sun will go out tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to the Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struck to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The programme documented its difficult way of return of damage caused by a ball that fractured her brain and persuaded the issued side of his brain, and that passed from front to back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned as a surprise to the Chamber to issue his triumphing vote in the agreement of debt.
In his first television interview since January Tyroteo, who killed six and killed at 13, Giffords laughed, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficulty".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, Giffords, 41-year-old, answered, "Very well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronauta Mark Kelly, was part of a special programme of "20/20" of a time of time, which was issued the weekend of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A story of courage and hope".
The special programme analyzed Giffords' recovery since January 8th.
In videos by Kelly in the first weeks, it is seen in her hospital bed, with a stuck head and a long cicatriz through her front.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband is the soul.
More months later, he looks at Giffords sitting on a wheel seat while therapeutes teach him how to make simple actions.
A head move.
A ransom of the people.
And then, his first word: "What."
In a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "totata", a change request in his breakfast menu.
Videos distributed by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congressist can sing together with the therapeutes the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" from Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" of Tom Petty.
At the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, which had two hours ago every day, said that it didn't recall the day of the tyroteo.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a article of the magazine on the murder of March 12 when she stopped to ask him for the first time about the six who had died in the accident.
The suspicious gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is arrested in a prison of Missouri and is medical by force while waiting for judgment.
"Man people died," Giffords said to Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a moment of her wife's recovery she said, "I've been destroyed."
"So, I said to you, 'Gabby, you haven't been broken," Kelly said.
"You're just hit.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're gonna get back and return with more power than ever."
The troops do feel more harmful than I respect
The event was a Wall Street gala, which recovered millions of dollars for veterans without home in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ball on impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, mariners, aeroplanes and marine infants fell in their posts in return to him.
The multitude of labels stood up and applauded.
"The men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of primaver funds.
A high rango military officer in the gala, also known as then the president of the Major State, the Major State, Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in different ways.
"They showed them as a kind of poor child," wrote the officer in a email.
I'm sure the organizations had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
Markly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has been emphasized by military and a public and often distant, sometimes, worshipper.
The troops are prodigious with elogies for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, say the members of the service.
The public is more acting as if they give him those uniforms.
"We are not absolutely victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some show their support is to put us in the role of departured arms."
The subject is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, which do not want to seem ungrateful or ungrateful with the public they serve.
They are also understood that the wrath to which the troops who returned in the last years of Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the discussions on the loss are being conducted in silence and in private among the war veterinarians.
After their two children returned to fight Marina's Infanteria, Mark Cancian's retired coronel warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they were responsible for the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be a "irrelevant and violent veteran under the surface", said Cancian, who tried in Iraq and returned to a high-level government work in Washington.
He felt that some interviewers had questioned him whether he could endure under the pressure of a necessary work in Washington immediately after his fighting tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to face negative impressions," Cancian reminded his children.
The military anxiety, partly, arises from the indifference and to wars.
The achievements in the battle field are rarely chosen for praise by a country with little family with the military and see a few direct benefits from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
"We, as a nation, have no longer valued the military heroism in ways that were totally common in the Second World War," said General Tenant David Barno, who commanded the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, politician and public elogies are highly focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognised by the number of tours they have supported, the number of friends they have lost or the reach of their disappointments.
The army faces a growing pressure to end the violation
This week, a historical audience will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their sustainable passion before violation.
If not, hundreds of applicants are organizing for the next.
The first Elizabeth Lyman soldier was 25 years old and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night when she said he was violated by a companion.
It was October 2008, and he was directed back to his quarter at the Airlines Miramar, north of San Diego, after the dinner with a friend when he met a colleague with a 12-site beer package.
He asked her if she could join her in her room to take a coffee.
"It was a signal of alarm," says Lyman.
However, Texas' native left his concern on one side.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's of Texas," he says.
"I would have heard my instincts."
In the few minutes to enter Lyman's room, the man approached him behind, brought her down and violated it, he said.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 members of the current and ancient military staff are anxiously expecting a judicial decision in a historical judgment that will be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the request they have interviewed against the Defence Secretary of Robert Gates and his preacher, Donald Rumsfeld.
The request states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce generalized violation between military men, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February presented by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, D.C., the demand was initially involved to 17 complaints, but it increased to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them were violated or awarded sexually by their companions, and the army failed at the time of investigation, processing, or delivering appropriate justice after the suggested aggressions.
Burke says he's going through the largest army plan, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a ≥ top to the bottom," he says.
"Who are the people who are able to eradicate the culture of repressions? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom may be part of future requests.
His strategy: Instead of compiling all the applicants in this case, putting all eggs in the same box, so that it will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The Defence Department Team, headed by the Federal Deputy Neil MacBride, has presented an invitation to disapproval the case.
The court's documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - in essence, that military people cannot be requested by current soldiers or ancient soldiers by the disasters suffered in armed forces.
By a judgment of the Supreme Court of 1950 called the Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage suffered by the active staff.
"The adjudicated damage is part of the military service of the applicants," states the documents.
The Defence Department refused to make comments for this article.
The things have changed since the 50s.
While women are still officially serving in battle, this distinction is only nominal: modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, soldier women's teams are playing more important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: among these two wars, 150 soldiers have died and two thirds of them in fighting.
It's time the army too to modernise, says Burke.
She is not alone in her fight, and three other requests are running outside her.
At Yale's Legal Faculty, the Clinic of Justice for Veterans is preparing a case against the four main military armies to promote a misogic environment.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a request against the army that is focused on the diagnostics of the "tractory of personality" assigned to the victims of violation in order to give them the highest of the service - a common event, the activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a group of human rights.
His group presented a request against Veterans in December, accused of discriminatory practices in the way he handles the claims of benefits for those who claim to have been sexually accepted in the service.
Nine draft law were submitted separately at the Congress by a bipartid mix of senators and representatives, offering a series of corrections.
In 2010, 3 158 sexual attacks were stated, the Office for Prevention of Sexual Agression and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the aggressions are note subsequently stated , and by its own estimates of Pentagon, which numbers about 13,5 per cent of the 19,000 estimated incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the processing procedures: In 2010, 20 per cent of the cases claimed in the army were to be judged - the half of the civil justice system.
The applicants in Burke's case described their attacks as the first of a series of trauma.
In the case of Lyman, he claimed the presumptuous violation to the military police less than a hour after it had happened.
That night, he said, he was asked to tell the details of his violation 11 times different than a multitude of police, doctors, and commanders.
She was subject to a kit of violation, and the blood of her aggressor - of a court in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended an audience before a judge, during which he was asked about having sexual relations with his friend on the day of the attack.
Six people declared as witnesses of personality in the name of the author, which was finally abssolute.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to work-- I found me crying out of the room."
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember that I told my officer, "It wasn't his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatric, who finally had a deterioration of personality, which did it not apte for the service.
In January 2010, the service was provided under less honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefit.
As regards whether the case presented by Lyman and his companions of demand continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, Professor of Rights at the Faculty of George Washington.
However, he said, "In my opinion, they should be able to continue."
What is involved between them and a verdict is this teaching that has been criticized since it has been published for the first time.
I was a permanent critical of the Doctrine Feres.
The army is dead behind because it does not have the same invival and disappointment that brings responsibility.
And he adds, "The probabilities are strong against them... but it's important for them."
These things only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the audience doesn't go on his way, Burke, lawyer of the applicants, will put his other hundreds of applicants at school for future cases.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this subject until reform occurs," he says.
"Or until we die, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before become the new face of Europe's extreme, Anders Behring Breivik was just another type that aired its anti-immigration points online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted that he had committed a murder in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, was to his first public court audience.
While Breivik could have acted alone, he was far away from being alone in the ciberspace: most of the time he had passed before his attack against his computer, talking with some of the millions of nationalists who support social network groups.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how can you find them?
Easy - you just have to enter Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report published on the European Digital Populism by the British DemoS study center.
The Facebook personal information alias is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their demographic characteristics with a scientific precision - the way the sellers have been using for years.
The Bartlett team found a half million fans of the desk groups throughout Europe, and then they brought ads, but instead of connecting them to a new band or diet product, the announcements invited users to complete an investigation that asked about their educational level, to violence and optimism about their own future.
When getting to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme parties in 11 European countries - all without exit from the office.
"It's a completely new way to make a research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not all surprising: Online partyers of the groups of desk tend to be young, men and hungry by immigration.
However, in a kind of road, "those who combine their online activism with outline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen."
Demos's work is just an example of how Facebook is being converted into a new and important tool in the hands of sciences.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends, as expressed in "I like", messages in walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding a average of three parts of content daily, Facebook's data supernova generates a growth of research, stimulating the number of academic works with the site's name at the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's beauty is that you can study people you couldn't approach with a folder in the street.
"Before, when you asked people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go to the party, and they would never allow you to access," said Bartlett.
"Facebook removes all that - you're going to them right."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address social health problems.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Megan Moreno, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and its colleagues found that university students who talked about their drinks on Facebook had a significantly greater risk of having problems with drinking that students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that students, such as residential advisers, can control the site and intervene to help a student who has too many state updates with their drinkers.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can't," said Dimitri Christakis, the co-ordinator of Moreno and Director of the Health Centre, Behavior and Development of the Child at the Infantil Research Institute of Seattle, said Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children in risk that otherwise they would not be used."
Facebook is also constantly "pinching" to his own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has established statistics on the status of the relationship and the Day of San Valentin, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a national happiness (principally using the information that can be used - digital freedom defenders long ago that the site should provide its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, enjoying or not - the sacrifice for playing Scrabble with a friend at thousands of kilometers away is allowing the site to minimize your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users are going to be part of an investigation that they don't know?
While researchers have directly defined well about how to collect their data out of line, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have thought if it's in the fact that a researcher could have examined his profiles," Neil Selwyn, a sociologist of the Londres Know Laboratorium, said about a study of 2006 that conducted with the Facebook public walls of students.
"What they were concerned, it was just between them and their friends."
Then it is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the information of a user's profile and of the wall messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do out of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That is why, despite its years as a researcher of technology, Selwyn believes that a subject and a boligraph are still the best research tools that no one can use.
"There is no subject to enter the real world and talk to the real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social is still happening out of line."
"Free and unhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in the court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to be the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has been described as a fighter of "resistance" during his first public appearance in the court of Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the movement of Norwegian Resistence and in the Norwegian Templers", he said before a full room with 500 people.
"I'm opposed to the court, since he received the mandate of the organizations supporting hatred's ideology and because he supported multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I'm not guilty."
Judge Torkel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologe, because "he didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express its viewpoints".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought an ancient discourse, to address the family of his victims at the end of the audience.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik under guard for more 12 weeks, offered access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have a strict control on all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and families of the victims attended audience.
Some came with the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that it is recluded under the key.
All assisted with the aim of progressing to the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," said a superman of Utoya to the Norwegian NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Being dressed with a dark and dark carrying aside, Breivik remained calm and professional during the audience and looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and went out of the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a major "resistence" movement, the judge decided that it is not a mental spirit, and said that there are no evidence that he acted with complices.
Some may advise that the attacks of July 22 seem to be an extremist in place of a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically swimming the pain and confusion that a nation still feels.
"I'd like it looks like a monster, but it doesn't seem," said a family of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it seemed."
7 Lections from Steve Jobs' lost interview, shown in a teater this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were some who compared it to Henry Ford - distinguing the genius of technology like the Great Moderno Inventor.
But what Apple's fans could find more discovery, in a recent interview of Jobs' networks, which has been developed as a series of special projections on the largest markets this week, is how creative this thought was understanding about the trade and work flows of the products.
It was no doubt a designer, dreamer and hyppie authorised, but he was also a medical organizer and an unki of the flow diagrams - a man who thought that many executives suffered "a illness that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 per cent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds (The Triunph of the idiots) on the arrows of the personal computer, and he sat for more than one hour with Jobs for a rare and rare conversation.
At that time, they had spent almost 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he had already worked intensely in his new NeXT computer company, waiting for the popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said that the originals of the interview disappeared during their transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a complete copy of VHS was found in the director's garage.
This file material, quickly revised, is the foundation of Steve Jobs: The lost interview, from 68 minutes, that comes to the Landmark Chinese this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating interviews in depth, Jobs here seems extraordinaryly ready to expose their technological and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points beyond the interview, there are big silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly suspecting their thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism goes to the surface, where it seems impairable due to Cringely's questions, enable you to go faster to the subjects or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before Pixar's era, iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophecy in the lost interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies do good and bad, and offers their own vision of the future of the informatics.
One thing is reading postual evaluations of Job's career, but there is something cruel and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer at the border of the size.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not so much after she explained everything in detail here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of the lost interview:
About how he was taking a business:
"In the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers that give you in a incredible way are, "Oh, that's just the way you are doing."
No one knows why he does what he does, in business, no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs carry out their efforts to simplify Apple's accountability.
Unconcerned by the way in which the costs were registered - often starting with a "standard cost" which was made in the eye of good covering, and then fitting with a "white" - developed an automaticized factory that ensured that they could determine the detail trade costs.
About Dad's crazy:
Jobs tells the "Caja A" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to raise the telephone company effectively and make calls for a long distance free.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs' eufory here when described the Box A as an act of empoderation is contagious.
Describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connected from a AT & T network to another, while he created a bucle with the greatest possible number of satellites.
"We were involved in things around the world a half twelve times and you cried to the public phone and returned a minute later to the public phone at the door by the side," Jobs said with a ridicule.
"We were young and what we did was that we could build something ourselves that could control thousands of millions of dollars in infrastructure worldwide."
We two, we didn't know much, but we could build a little thing that could control one giant thing -- it was a wonderful lesson, and I don't think that Apple would never have existed without it.
Jobs continued describing a glorious broom that he and Wozniak almost left, calling the Vatican to the Box A in the middle of the night and asking to talk to the father while he did his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Jericho were convocated in half the night to talk to the diplomatic and _BAR_ they were both in prison just before the same Pope was wake up to go to answer the phone.
About love for technology (and telephone sale with Bill Hewlett):
At 12 years of age, at the repository seats to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone guide and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs got a summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"It was a wonderful influence on me, it was the only company that I had seen at that age and made my vision of what was a company and what they were dealing with their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the investigations of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer never made".
He was as big as a bitch, I had a little catholic tube screen, and I loved him.
With a traveling to HP as a teenager, I would take time with that machine and write programs for her.
About improving innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the market.
Soon in his career, since he was dedicated to sell a basic paint of plates, he asked a customer if he could mount all the team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the installation and delivery of finished devices.
Later, while he was in Apple, he repeat the fights to which he developed a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they cried out that it would be needed five years [to create a mouse that would cook $300], and I was thrown and went out and found a designer.
Nine days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
About large undertakings losing force:
Much before he led Apple's reborn, Jobs prophecy predicted the way in which many industrial leaders would cross in their vision, and they would control their market share.
"Tell me you're working on IBM or Xerox, so you're making better photo copyers and printers, and what?"
You have the monopolie of the market quota, so the company doesn't have any success.
Sales and marketing departments increase the success, so this type of persons who end by conducting companies and products are exited from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of products that led to this monopolie position is possible because of people who do not have the meaning of good products with bad products - the knowledge of the necessary office.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have been joined from all the computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the wound of the victory.
About innovation as artificial expression:
"There's a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as it evolutes the great idea, changes and grows."
It is much about the subtilities of the same.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't do to do the electrons, the glass make them, the robots do it, the factories do it.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at the same time...
Finally, it reduces the pleasure - it turns down to exposure you to the best of a human team that has done, and then try to adapt the things you are doing.
Picasso said the good artists copy, the big artists steal.
We've never seen awareness about stealing big ideas.
What in part made Macintosh great was that people who were working on it were musicians, poetes, artists, zoologists, historians, which were eventually the best scientists of the world.
If I wasn't through the informatic, I could have done wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with the rivals of the Assistance Act Sana while the court accepts the case
On the day when the Supreme Court meet at the closed door to examine the politically controversy issue of whether they would accept the challenge of the law of sane assistance by President Obama, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and ́rence Thomas, were arrested at a dinner patrocinated by the signature of lawyers that would expose the case before the high court.
The opportunity was last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered themselves in a preliminary audience to study the requests of review.
One of the cases concerned was a request submitted by 26 states in dealing with the total reform of the sane assistance adopted by the Congress last year, a law which has been a claim of war for conservative activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to admit the application to trade and, in fact, expected a historical statement of 5 and a half hours to March, and the result would probably increase the presidential career of 2012, which will be in full depooted at the time when the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and claim that the law should be rejected will probably be Paul Clement, who served as the US general tax during the government of George W. Bush.
The signature of Clement's lawyers, Bancroft P±C, was one of the nearly two decades of companies who helped patrocinate the annual dinner of the Federal Society, a group dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles for many years.
Another signature that patrocinated the dinner, Jones Day, represented one of the commercial associations that challenged the law, the National Independent Trading Federation.
Another patrocinator was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has an enormous financial interest in the result of the litigium.
The dinner was celebrated at a hotel in Washington, hours after the preliminary audience of the court on the case.
Among the assistants, inter alia, Mitch McCon日 was the most important Republican in the Senate and one or one declared of the Sana Assistance Act.
Special guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It is nothing new: the two judges have attended events of the Federality Society for years.
And it's not something that comes into conflict with ethical standards.
In fact, the judges are excluded from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of the underlying federal judges.
If they did not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge can assist events to recover funds of organizations related to the law and other, although the judge cannot be a speaker, an honourable guest, or to be included in the programme of such event. "
However, the absolute neighborhood of Scalia and Thomas to two of the lawyers buffets in the case, as well as a company with an enormous financial interest, was sufficient to alarm ethical activists in the government.
"This impressive breach of ethics and indifference towards the code is against the requests of several judges to be taken by the court by the same rules applying to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were arrested in a collection of gala funds with lawyers who had cases in the court."
His appearance and assistance in the recovery of funds for this event was subject to any request of impartiality, and it is inacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticisms that say that they mix the court's activity too easily with the agenda impulsed by groups such as the Federal Society.
And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is one of these activists reserve.
On the other hand, the conservators argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has a ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecution of Obama administration when the first legal challenges were submitted to the first court.
His critics have pressed Kagan to avoid seeing the case, saying that she was too involved in defending the law as to be now imparcial.
Kagan didn't give any indication that he'd do it.
Boeing receives a record request of $18 billion
The Emirates line requests 50 double boeing flights Boeing 777, with option to 20 more.
Boeing also sells six boeing Dreamliner plans to Oman Air, a valued operation in over billion dollars.
It is rarely news when a company receives a request of 50 units of its product.
But it's a great transaction when the company is the Boeing Co Airlines Manufacturer and the sales price for the 50 plane is a record of $18 billion.
It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine in growth of future aircraft requests.
In a study given on Monday, the Chicago company considers that for the next 20 years the lines in the Middle East will need 2.520 aircrafts per value of $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend his biggest request of the story for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 jets Boing 777 double past.
The successful request came from the Emirates line in Dubai.
The line also has an option to buy 20 more flights, which would increase the total sales price to $26 billion, announced Boeing at the Dubai Airport Room 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had requested six Boeing 787-8s, the named Dreamliner, which assumes a fuel rate and services for spectacular passengers.
The sales price for six of them is over billion dollars.
"This has clearly an enormous positive effect for Boeing," said the Morningstar Neal Dihora analysis.
"The quality of these customers is very strong."
Many Middle East lines are the property of their oil producers nations.
Therefore, they have not only money to pay the aircraft, but also an increase in fuel prices - generally damageous for airlines, because it is one of the largest costs - it is not so damageous because the country is winning money with the increase in the price of oil.
This is important because they have less probabilities than other lines to cancel or delay the flight orders when fuel prices increase, Dihora said.
"You have natural protection," he said.
The request of the Emirates strengthens Boeing's leadership on the wide floor market and helps to maintain the intention of its Airbus SAS competitor to invade his domination with the A350 passenger airplane.
The victory of Boeing at the air festival is produced four months after Airbus said that it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which computes directly with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the debut to add more impulse after the customers had increased profitable load and rango.
Boeing Co's actions increased 1.5% to 67.94 dollars.
The sister of the president of Mexico, on a disrupted opinion in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderon that the drug traffickers helped their opposer of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the content of the ruler.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost her candidature to govern Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she took a break on Monday that the drug traffickers helped to draw the career for one of its opposers.
The preliminary results gave the front in the road for the west ruler of the state to Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of crime organized during all the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarmant, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview one day after the vote of Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... they bought up the urns, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" for the Pri.
The PRI governed Mexico during seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the scene of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI has the hope of wining the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have overcome a little margin to Calderon, who had led the investigations before elections.
Calderon, a candidate from the Conservator National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate on the left by the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, currently occupying the responsibility of manager, remained in the third place a great damage to the left divided and unfortunate before the presidential elections of 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, exalted from the capital of the State of Morelia, refused to link drugs and encouraged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has been dominated for a long time by specialized drug cards in marihuana, heroin and methanfetaminas.
It is the national state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offence against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has continued.
A PAN officer was murdered a week before elections during the campaign by Luisa María Calderon, and many candidates abandoned local candidatures for fear.
Although for the PRI, because of unappreciably looking like Michoacán's elections, a victory will help to stimulate the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated with Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraged, from the face to the next year."
BAsD encourages Asia to help save the euro area
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has made an invitation to India and China to prepare them to help save the euro zone of their sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would lead to the growth of Asian economys.
Rajat Nag, director-General of the Asian Development Bank with a seat in Manila, said that the two larger growth economys in the world had to "do all possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic block already outside the International Monetary Fund or directly to bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brasil, Russia, India, China] countries who observe Europe's difficulties in a "impartial way" and said that Asia's financial assistance together with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
"So anyone who can help Europe to get out of the crisis is useful," said the Financial Times in an interview in the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected in a certain measure, but it can't be immune."
"So if China and India can help, that's by all means."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undergone by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In the last days, the costs of deduction in Italy have been dangerously shot and the first ministers of Italy and Greece have released.
The current crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe has increased the fear that the world economy could be emphasized to the recession and has generated calls to join the main economics to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Nag foretold that any Asian support would be channeled to the FMI, but he said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of the relief fund of the EU, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered a greater negotiation power for the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Ministry of Commerce, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone because its own economy was now suffering from the fall of exports and the deterioration of foreign capital entries.
"No one wants the euro zone to continue to be instabil and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to keep a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's an emperor, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economys such as India are not responsible for helping the rich Europeans when they face their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor of the Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically difficult to sell the aid to Europe for the millions of two hundred thousand people in India, from which up to 800 million live with about $2 per day or less.
"In some moment, it will be noted that the Greeks are jubiled at the age of 50 years and are going from vacations to the beaches and that will not fall well," he said.
Lee Howell, manager of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reservations should be used to maintain the number of and well-recompensed workers of the Greek public sector, in mal-administrated business jobs, and loss generators such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the euro zone crisis threatened with "important effects in chain" throughout Asia.
The Prognoses of the Asian Development Bank of 7.5 per cent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 are now to "the risks to be low" due to Europe's threat.
He said that the vulnerable markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant outcomes from their economy.
Series of Pentagon's warnings on possible defence coverages
The Defence Secretary, Leon Panetta, warned the Congress on Monday, warning that the auto-budgetal coverages that are involved could cover national security and provoke a financial reaction in chain from the Pentagon Paths, to the Afghanistan battle fields, to civil mounting chains.
The Pentagon is already digging the 450 billion dollars of reductions for the next department, but now he is afraid of a additional reduction of 600 billion or more in coverings that may be imminent if the Congress cannot reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these snippets would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, republician by Arına, and Lindsey Graham, republician by South Carolina.
He said that the failure of the Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, called "sequestro", would take place 23 per cent of global reductions and a higher to many new projects.
"A so large, applied in this indisable way, would make most of our ships and building projects unable to be executed - it cannot be purchased three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other efforts to modernize," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be obliged to separate many of our civil officers in an involuntary way and because the reduction would be so fast, it is almost safe that we would have to license civilians in order to fulfil the objective."
"These changes would break faith with those who keep our army and would severely harm the good provision."
The shorts of time would reach the fighting troops, said Panetta.
"Although the financing for wartimes in the accounts of ultra-sea contingency operations does not seem directly affected by the sequest, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious losses in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The contracting of staff would be reduced, which would lead to delay in contracts and supervision of the contract supporting war."
"The staff in nomin would be reduced, giving delay in payments to providers in wartime, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, requesting information about the potential impact of auto-scortes in the Defence Department.
"The consequence of a crowd in the Defence Department would cause a quick decline from the United States as the main military power of the world."
"We are firmly against this draconical action," the senators said in a joint communication on Monday afternoon when they published the Panetta letter.
"This is not a result that you can live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose ourselves."
"The square is a threat to the interests of the United States' national security, and it should not be allowed."
If the Panetta letter and the recent warnings of senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or will intensify the calls to exempte the Pentagon of the scores is going to see.
Panetta has been increasingly closer to possible recovery, although it has reached a work at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets at the Congress and the White House, and knowing that it was to make difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a shadow panorama of what could be before - an army with a concha, but not a nuclear.
"It's a ship without mariners."
"It's a brigade without balls."
"It's an airline without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of quarters, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers to fulfil the mission," Panetta said in his words of opening in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers low morality, low preparation, and is not able to keep on the day with the potential of opponents."
"In fact, he invites the aggression..."
In an addition to their letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta explains new details about how reductions "generate important operational risks: delay in the time of response to crisis, conflicts and disasters; limited hardly our ability to be deployed and committed before the world; and it provides an inacceptable risk in future fight operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could face the hacha, including those already testing, and some only in the first stages of the planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighting plane, a new planned bombarder, the Balistic sub-sea of new generation, the new litoral fighting ship and the new land fighting vehicle that the Army and the Marine need to replace, humvee.
Stoping F35's development and additional tests could generate about 80 billion dollars for 10 years, but their partners say that it is the next vital step to improve and face the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A view of the latest holders indicates how serious and all representatives are misleading and lying in daily life.
The Republican President's candidate Herman Cain is occupied by exchangeing accusations of sexual accusation with several women; each party is accused of lying to the other.
The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury for providing to hide reports that claim that a retired football trainer was sexually enjoying children.
Last week, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, was "pilled" with an open microphone by the President of the U.S., Barack Obama, that the first minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu is a mentor.
Light has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The Congressist by New York and Exhibitionist on the Internet, Anthony We ♫, made the ridicule with its destructions quickly rejected by the irrefutable test.
The former President John Edwards has been accused of crimes in the financing of the campaign related to covering an extra-matrimonial relationship.
And again, no one who would live to him will never live the media cycle disappointed by President Bill Clinton while lying during his second mandate on his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The legends on tramps are very extensive in the school and university reviews.
There have been cases in which teachers have given the responses of the reviews to students in order to be better viewed in their performance assessments.
Mentors that should be teaching the contrary are sending the message that lies and lies are acceptable.
How many mistakes do we find?
Any day, studies show that you can lie in any place between 10 and 200 times.
That's sure, many of these lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that the unknown were lying three times in the first 10 minutes.
Detecting lies, or "local location of lies", is a essential ability that we should all buy for both personal and professional reasons.
Rather than being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to claim: "I have you," the detection of misleading is a role of knowledge based on scientist data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that have performed deep research projects, especially in psychology and physology.
One of the results of the research is that old myths about lie have been rejected.
The lying people look in their eyes.
They're not always tortured, balbucean, rumored or worrying.
It cannot also be concluded that lying people are difficult to detect or dismask.
A trained lying detector can reach the truth with regard to the statement, microfacial expressions, questions training and time.
For several years, I studied the scientist discoveries on the mistakes in the wide and always emergent body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of the liability is a modern technology that is easy to guard and help to navigate through our complete world - especially if its professional responsibility includes contracting, interviews, or negotiations.
Good lying people have the ability to read well to others, making them feel pleasant, manipulating their own emotions and feeling intuitively how others feel.
We know about the investigations that extrovertides lie more than introverted, that men say more "oriented lies towards themselves", while women say more "oriented towards others" -- usually to protect the feelings of someone -- that married people are less often lied to their couples than those who are not married (but the lies they mean to be "worrying").
We also know that if you are felt as an evildoer, the others will feel less guilty to lie to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal conduct of the subject.
This is called "creating a baseline".
Help provide reference points to measure the changes after.
Note the position of the subject, laughing and vocal characteristics.
It's better to know if someone normally goes with the feet all the time to not make unfair accusations when he sees his feet shopping in the middle of the.
Then look for misleading, verbale and not verbale groups.
Consider these behavior groups as alarm signs, not as a proof of error.
People who are disappointing can congel the top of the body by trying to remember his story, point their feet to the door, turn to a output, change their position significantly or show a "post-interview" -- that excessive suspect of refreshment and change of position once all difficult questions have ended.
The interrogators often make sure that the interview has been completed only to seek that post-interview refreshment.
Take also attention to the vocabulary of the subject.
Scott Peterson put the foot to the bottom and used the past time while he put his murdered wife alive, launching a search from her at national level.
People who mislead can also use a remote language: "I had no sexual relations with that woman... Mrs. Lewinsky" or repeat a very difficult question.
The most common verbale indicators are sutiles.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question: "Good... to say truth... until I... I understand."
This makes the answer a perception instead of a fact and is often a signal of warning.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but develop skills to discover error is possible.
These abilities will improve the possibilities of anybody to avoid being victimed by staff artists in their professional and personal lives.
The contradiction plan of the dismissed oil after the threat of U.S. retard in its approval
Days after the administration of Obama threatened to delay the approval of a planned oilduct from Canada to Mexico Golf -- envying the syndicates, while pausing the psychologists -- the company seeking to build the oliveduct says that it is ready to redistribute the project to return to it.
TransCanada said on Monday night that will move the planned oil outside the field of Sandhills in Nebraska, and he trusts that the project will win the approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
The Director of TransCanada, Alex Perbax, says that the company keeps his confidence that the oil is approved with time, but it is true that with a different path.
This comes after the announcement last week by the Department of State that they would delay the decision by a federal authorisation for the project until new potential paths were studied that avoid the areas of Sandhills of Nebraska and Ogallala, a widespread water supply.
"This is a real way of progress," said the representative Lee Terry, the Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is possible to separate any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although the officers refused that the policy would be involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department and expressed all its support to them.
The oilduct, from 1.700 km, would spread from Canada to Mexico Golf.
It would take 700,000 barriles per day from Alberta's province to the reefs in Texas.
For that, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by theologists, but loved by the working groups, which have been apostated by the estimation of 200,000 jobs linked to oilduct.
But the legislators of Nebraska who are opposed to the plan are suppressing legislation to force a distance from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquaculture, the largest source of potential water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the State Department found that the project had only limited environmental adverse impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the Department General Inspector has ordained an independent evidence of the review process, focused on two issues.
One is whether the member of the lobby contracted by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was a campaign adviser of Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the programme.
The other is whether a signature that was contracted to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle requested for provoking an immortal child of fear
A family of New York that the diva of the disc music, Patti LaBelle, behaved as a crazy in the cotton of Manhattan's building, terrifying his little daughter until the point he was scared.
The diary of the song of "Lady Marmalade" feared Genevieve Monk, 18 months of age, so that he suffered "perseverance changes, deteriorations of dream" and "increased fear of strangers", says her family at the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was on 10 November of the past year when the tramoyist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, child garden teacher, and Genevieve was preparing to go to a family travel.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Rose Monk descended to the building of the Riverside Boulevard, with his team, leading to Genevieve.
Roseaux Monk said he stopped near the door and put his daughter on the ground for a moment.
"No one approached behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said to her, "Yes, and I went to take her," he said.
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left her daughter near the door," said Rosen Monk.
"I said, "I don't have any interest in what you say or think."
It was angry and eaten to use bad words - the word C and the word J in high voice...
I had a bottle of water and began to throw the water of the bottle on me."
He said Genevieve was histerical.
"I told this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
LaBelle was aware of her mother -- which still was subject to Genevieve -- and she had to be contained by her environment and returned to a car that was expecting her, said Rosiones Monk.
The little girl was crying so strong that he was wrapped, he grew.
Later, the family sent a note requesting a excuse from LaBelle, but he did not answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return the calls to comment on the event.
The request seeks unspecified damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he took the case freely and that the family plans to give all the money that can be given to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is completely inacceptable, especially when it is directed to a childhood garden teacher that leads to a 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity promoted economy
The first year of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa, has increased unemployment and informality, has decreased foreign investment and economies
In 2011, it is a year that will be recorded in the Sinaloa economic history, the first year of the Mario López Valdez Government, autonomous of the change, which generated great expectations for the progress in the economy, but because of the climate of the beginning of the year, it is not observed growth, however, a deterioration is recorded in the main economic development indicators.
The low February temperatures, as well as the cause of lost millionary agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, have caused a contrast of economic activity generally 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the history falling from 31.16 per cent in the agriculture, which affected the dynamic of other economic sectors.
According to the report of iron impacts issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable rural development, 582.835 cultivated hectares, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main cultures were of vegetables, milk and garbage.
The fall in the economic activity has produced, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, the National Statistics and Geographic Institute has made the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year, since, while January 55.053 synonyms were busy, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Economicly Active population, for the second quarter the rate was 5.28 per cent, and between July and September, the average increased up to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in the number of people was low to more than 74.000 unemployed synonyms, an increase in the first half of 18.969 individuals.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economy Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the UAS Economic and Social Science Facility, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions carried out from the public policy.
"What is seen is a growth of unemployment that is involved with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market for a restriction of resources by the law adopted at the conference to combat money waste, and for people who have illegally acquired dollars it is not easy to work, invest them and use them in something," he expressed.
Migration arrested
López Cervantes pointed out that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who go from the state in foreignership, in the United States has been limited, first because of the difficulties to enter, and secondly because they already have many difficulties to find work, these people are staying and seeking sources of work here in the state, which makes the unemployment rise," she showed.
Informality
An analysis of the work market is highly highly informed between the working conditions, which is 60.38 per cent of the occupied population in the state without being covered as a worker to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informalness, another of the low payments of the state is the lowest wages, it has the lowest wages of the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Work and Social Prevention.
The average income of synonymous workers was, until September, 5000 352 weights, very under the national average, located at 7000 375 weights.
IED contraction
As regards the fall of economic activity and the growth in unemployment, in 2011 the largest reduction of the external investment was recorded in the last 10 years, the Economy Secretariat of January to June of the State IED was summarized 630.697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87.74 per cent in respect of the 5 143.000.312 dollars registered during the same period of the previous year.
The Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 million weights per year, mainly from third sector companies.
The Debt
Before the economic contracting scenario, the Government of the State requested the State conference to approve a loan for 3 billion weights, which would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with a view to reactivating the economy, the approval of the local convention was of 2 billion billion weights, and until November they have not observed the benefits of debt in any state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industrie, expressed that in 2011 the harmonization of volunteers of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensely to restore the field we lost in this year, in 2012 we have to renew efforts, we missed the effort of all and, above all, the good course already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he expressed.
Economy long-term
Loredo López showed that events such as the iron of the year's principles stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is a product of various age, including irons, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn back as quickly enough to generate a economic dynamic that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year we close very under the expectations we had," he mentioned.
Redefine Call
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, showed that it was renewed to cause the state to productive activities of greater dynamic.
"In general, we have noted that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the state's vocation and economic course is redefinited, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource which has Sinaloa has has been suspended," he said.
Working to do
The President of Coparmex highlighted the importance of establishing a future vision that better affects Government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government has been endeavored to give good results in various matters, in the field of economic development, there are some advances, but it is important that a long-term programme is developed."
He pointed out that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policies.
"There are elements that allow to say that the Government is being more comprehensive, I can say that there is a work done and I think the Government is aware that there is a job to do," he expressed.
They condemn it by 8 kg of mariguaine
At five years of prison and 100 days of charge, a neighbor of Navolato was sentenced by the possession of eight kilograms of mariguaine.
The General Procureur of the Republic informed that the judged drugsman was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of health, in its marijuana property variant for trade.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 in a monitoring operation on the Ciprian Street Valdez, before post 80, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.

_____________________________________________________________________
The social works referred to in programmes such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for people are in danger of not being concluded or to have serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Social Development pointed out that, although work programmes have been advanced until now, they are in risk when the Government of the State did not comply with the contributions corresponding to it, which provide a resource exceeding 11 million weights in the three programmes.
He noted that the investment in these three programmes was totally of almost 50 million weights, of which the State corresponds to 25 per cent and that only the Federation and the municipality have provided resources for works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these is being made in force.
"There are almost 12 million what touchs them to contribute and despite the end of the year they have not given us a fifth, when they should give us a part since July," he said, "We have started the works and are very advanced, but we need money."
He mentioned that, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla last year, the State did not comply with the contributions corresponding to them, so at the beginning of the administration, the municipality had to request a loan to cover the more than 7 million that had not contributed to the State administration at that time.
"We had already passed in the previous sex because the State had no economic capacity to participate, and the programmes continued walking, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the State had delayed," he detailed.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he recommended that the request was made to the Secretary of Property and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to accelerate the management so as soon as possible that the percentages correspond to them were reached as soon as possible.
"There are almost 12 million what touchs you to contribute, and although the year is at end, we haven't been given a fifth."
Valid "analogic pagon" court in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of digital analogic signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nations (SCJN) disappreciated the constitutional disputes interrupted by the Senate and the Chamber of Members against the presidential decree that continued the " analogic pagon" from 2021 to 2015, unless the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderon was not responsible for its assignments by issueing the decree that describes the actions to continue to make the transition to the earthly digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was deprived of not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes in order to make the Court statement of the constitutionality or inconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree inconstitutedly because the regulation of radio and television materials is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), contrary to the Jerichic subordination principles and the reservation of law.
Only for the project were voted Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Members promoted two constitutional disputes to impose the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions provided for for digital transition.
The full of ministers also decided to disapprove the request submitted by the Chamber of Members without entering the draft discussion, also under Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In its intervention, the Minister said not to match the arguments of the project, in the meaning that the Federal Executive cannot set the measures to prepare the public administration.
"I do not also think that if it had done it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he reminded that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the Federal Executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the rectory of the State.
The substitution of digital analogic signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in the past years, and it is translated to a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
Applying the change would be to postpone the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "after covering economic, social, policy and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of all the system established, in accordance with the principle of the State's economic rectory, includes a group of assignments that the Constitution leads to the faculty of the State Executive."
He remembered that a large number of countries worldwide has already concluded the digital transition, and has done it to the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical organs.
It is not possible to conclude that the Executive, when issued the imposed decree, which invades any way the area of the Congress's competences, has ensured that in the administrative field the compliance with the laws issued by the legislation is provided.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" in Michoacán
According to the data drawn by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the manager's election is only 27 per cent, yet without accounting for the 879 of the 6 000 74 total acts.
The possibility of the " vote by vote" is a reality in this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where, in accordance with the data drawn up by the Preliminary Electoral Result Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, yet without accounting the votes related to the 879 of the 6 74 total acts.
In this regard, the President of the General Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), Mary of the Landeral Angles Zaragoza, reminded that a few days ago, only last 9 November, the electoral body adopted a series of linements to harmonize local standards with the Federal Electoral Reform.
As reminded, Michoacan did not approve its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code of the State or its Electoral Justice Act, since the State Congress adopted the reforms soon before the legal term was concluded so that they could enter into force in this electoral process and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel dismissed its publication in the terms set out in the Official Journal Act of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nations (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State mandate to constitutional reforms, since it has no right to " sanction or veteration".
Interviewed in turn to the possibility of the " vote by vote", Mary of the Llandern Angels expressed that by the approval of the relevant lines by the IEM General Council it would be possible to carry out partial and total accounts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the part of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be given in the cases that: the results of the acts are not covered; the scrutiny and compute act is not in the box document or does not open in the power of the President of the box; or, when there are evident errors or changes of the acts.
Furthermore, the total summary of the vote received in all boxes of the election may be carried out when it is indicated that the difference between the candidate who wins the election and which has received the second place in the vote is equal or less than a percentage point; whereas at the beginning of the meeting, the request is expressed by the representative of the party and/or coalition requested to the second of the indicated candidates.
The total amount of the vote can also be carried out if the difference between the candidate presumedly winner and the placed secondly is equal or less than a percentage point, even if the stated request of the representative of the political party whose candidate remained secondly, where the electoral packages which have been subject to partial accounting will be excluded.
It should be noted that in that situation the election of Morelia is found, where the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, although the votes of 129 of the 923 total acts are not calculated.

Wednesday, the new Italian government will be formed
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will be held to a crisis that has placed that country at the border of the economic disaster
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will be meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy at the border of the economic disaster and has put the entire euro zone in danger.
A communication from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will be gathered on Wednesday with the President, Georgio Napolitano, to confirm that a Government can form.
It is expected to present a office composed in its majority of technocrates, although it is not clear that the charge will assume the new executive.
Monti said that he would present to the President the results of its conversations with the political parties in its attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the ton of its comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well delineed," he aggressed.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has stimulated the cost of its debt at unsustainable levels.
The new administration addressed by the former Commissioner Monti must approve a hard packaging of austerity which the European leaders have to restore the wounded confidence in Italy.
Underlineing the pressure on Monti to be quick, the market instability placed the performance of the Italian good BTP to 10 years above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were binding to be redeemed.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronal Confindustria, said to the press after he met Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's success opportunities were highly impulsed by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, to whom the crisis had committed to release the Sabbath.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to have a good result," said the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Centre Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is significant because yet many of its members have been opposed to the Government of the technological majority that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary appeal
The new Government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what probably will be an outermost reform.
What blocking or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreigners was summarized to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti started its consultations on Monday with political, university and business groups, as well as with young and female organizations.
He'll end his meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitan, which has enabled an extremely quick transition in response to the crisis.
After a short breath at the end of the last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would dimitrite, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty of whether the new Prime Minister has success.
Reserving Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defence of the euro area.
Monti said that its Government should take up until the next elections for 2013, despite the generalised predictions that politicians will only give it time to implement reforms before making the election progress.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the large parties insist that it should be formed only by technicals, an indication of their repairs before a process obliged by financial pressure.
Political sources indicated that mutual disconfiance and disappointments among the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The rock of the Spanish is higher than the tics
Of the 22 footballs called Spain, ten rebase the 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica only one of the 22 convocates arrived at the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, if the 22 convocated by both countries are compared to the friend of today at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and Europe campaigns, number one of the FIFA men' ranquin, account a wide range of A class interselected games, Tricolor only has the defensor Michael Umána as the only one who has the 50 international parties.
This number the alkan in the previous Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballists playing at the Stars Liga and in powerful clubs of the Prime Liga of England keep an intense activity in liga and home coffee campaigns, and high-level chocks in European coppers such as Champions League.
Previously, the experience with Spanish Furia in complicated eliminations from the Eurocope and the Football World is summarized.
In contrast, tic futbolists have a limited international rock in a area, such as Concacaf, which is considered as the lowest level within the FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish Selection is of the Iker Casillas arquer, which on the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the Andoni Zubizarreta exporter, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today before the Tricolor and will introduce a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, a flying brain from Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even in the previous week, were recognised by the EUFA with the other centuries of the Ibéric team, the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the arithme of the Schalke, Raul González, with 102.
Almost near the centenary number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tick side, and near Michael Umána, they are the isolated side of Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and artillery Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After Property, only five passed over the 30 games: Keilor Naves with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Searchquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not closer to the 20th.
While Nano Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar is only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still not debuting.
The historical shooter in Spain is David Villa, with 50 days, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who registers more than nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Fifth included the country in its round of two trailers
"Go to Costa Rica is a real dream."
In interview with Viva, the Jeff Ament bathroom, of Pearl Jam, said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts on the next Sunday, at the National Stadium.
They have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that they will also become the dream of playing in the country.
Thus the basket and founder member, Jeff Ament, who spoke in Viva, from Brazil last week.
The grouping is located in the South America Ala of its two working decades and on Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day they will be presented at the National Stadium, from 7:30 p.m., with the angelic band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extracte of the conversation, whose full transscription is on the Internet.
For his costary followers, is it a real dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are living?
Go to Costa Rica is a real dream for us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and has been great until now.
I've been in Costa Rica only once and once; it's a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay for a few days.
So it encourages us to carry our music.
I wonder why there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely in the previous days.
What do you say to your worst followers?
Thank you for staying close to us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so much and we regret that he has taken so much time to reach it.
Some people even refer to their concert as the largest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we have touched during the last 21 years have occurred in the last few weeks.
We play a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and hope that this has put us in a form for this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we are very anxious to play.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best of the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and her oils to surfe?
We have many friends who are surfeers and have a big friend living in Tamarindo and the villages are incredible.
My friends were always going to surfe Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, are big places to surfe; this was how we knew, through people who love surf.
When they saw the girdle, they came to deliver great shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched before, then we have no restriction on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give them to our fans a good and different repository.
You never repeat the repository.
What's this debt?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's difficult to choose what songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repository we have the mouse to do not touch, this keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because we reveal the reasons why we liked these songs and that we could have been guided.
That makes the show more interesting for us, and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of tragedy.
When looking back, is it difficult to believe everything they have achieved?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think no one of us think we'd be in a large rock band and have done it for more than 20 years ago he seemed to be a dream.
We continue to count our blessings, and it feels that we can continue to do music together.
We all want and we love to create music.
We are happy to go to the world places to whom we always wanted to go.
The things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the growth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of large bands.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a move comes from a group of friends and it's a little common thing.
Sometimes, a band of a city arises, but it's much more strange when five or ten bands go out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honest to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in its round, so we are happy to be friends of all of them still and honored us to be part of that sound of Seattle that happened.
It is also very strange that a band like the one of you remains united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) has joined us 13 years ago, which is, by themselves, much more time than many bands.
First of all, I think we are all happy to be still alive and, secondly, we all are concerned about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, also open musical adventures that give freedom to each of us to experiment.
We trust each other with everyone's music and couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the famous word has not been simple; but thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we went growing, it was easier to find a balance.
We're sure that you're not too moved because it's easy to fall in that game of the big and people who love your music.
While one recalls that people are for music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what you brought it, without being anxious and being a rock star, something that no one of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a disc until Andy died (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations because it was so long and most important that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or I see a photo thinking in the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, ridicule us, talk about music and football and much more.
It was a surprising human being, and we've surprised it.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your job, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band that most liked us, so we are anxious to see what Las Robertas can offer in life and must be very entertained.
Why are they always changing Yellow Ledbetter's letter alive?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He's sing it and I think he's doing it with what's happening to him first.
As a bathroom, what are your influences?
They're so much.
Inside the first things that happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They're so much that I could talk all the afternoon about the bathrooms I love.
How has Pearl Jam achieved to keep the grong relevant although it is no longer a mode?
I think all of us always feel a little of the greenge word.
When I think of it, I remember the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all those who arose at the same time, and, if there is a importance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that worth the pen and bands like Mudhoney are now doing better music than ever.
At the beginning, his music had a darker content and now has been more positive.
What is this change worth?
It's interesting because I think there's a couple of songs in the new album that may appear more library, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe, which qualify as very dark songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I wept when I heard them and are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow and there's some trauma in your life and lose a family or a friend, these things begin to influence your art and your music and these two songs, of course, represent it to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still can make music dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is now internated for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was interviewed on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated by the loss of muscle force presented on the feet, informed your headquarters.
Fuymori, 72 years old, who fulfils 25 years of prison for violations of human rights committed during its government (1990-2000), suffers several pains, including a cancer in the language which has been operated four times and that is under control.
Congressist Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, said to the channel N of television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days in the National Neoplasic Sickness Institute to determine the reason for the pain and loss of force of its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that in its opinion, Fujimori would be a candidate to gain the benefit of the indulgence for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because he is innocent.
It was operated four times cancer in the language, it has a weight loss of 18 kg, which has been assembled with other pathologies such as severe erotic gastritis, the kiss of pancreas, renal estimates, hypertension and problems in the feet, the doctor enumerated.
Fuymori complied with reclusions since September 2007 to the National Police Special Operations Direction.
In April 2009, 25 years of prison were condemned for the death of 25 persons in hands of an army distillation scratch, which acted clandestly in the first years of his government.
Much travels to Mexico to strengthen political links
A official committee, headed by the Uruguay President, José Mujica, and integrated by several ministers and businesses, will start this Tuesday a visit to Mexico in order to expand trade between both nations and to address political issues of the region.
Musica will be gathered next Wednesday with her mexican par, Felipe Calderon, the highest point of a agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collectivity of Uruguay residents in Mexico, is the agenda distributed by the Uruguay Presidency.
The between both presidents, in Guadalajara, will be "for the exchange of information in all the political matters between the two nations", it was published on its website by the Presidentship of South America.
If you are local media, Musica would seek to achieve that Calderon supports Uruguay in the incident with France when the French mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South America country in a list of tax paradises in the G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In its speech, Sarkozy threatenes to exclude from the international community to those countries who are still fiscal paradises, a declaration that caused Uruguay's employment and called to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico presides G20 since November, the group integrated by the most powerful and developed countries in the world, and has a convention with the South America country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government has enhanced the concretion of fiscal exchange agreements in order to exit the "green list" of the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OCDE), which has been developed by countries who have not implemented all international standards of tax cooperation.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have a Free Trade (TLS) which has increased the exchange of goods between both nations since 2004.
The bigotud fontaneer is spent the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, inconscient, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the bowser's garments, but he has never done it in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to the tents of all the world, has been designed from a beginning to use the features of the Nintendo 3DS laptop console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without need to use walls.
"Mario is the person who has to say how the stereoscopy should work without cattle," said Nintendo's specialized press responsibility in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game thought originally for this support" , since even now successes like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adjustments of existing titles.
Nintendo's portfolio has insisted that, despite being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and fluid game.
Alvarez has made that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "single" to join less possible users.
Once over, the most experts will be able to give a "second return" to the game levels, which this time have greater difficulties.
Furthermore, users can choose in real time between a "Agressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and "not submit to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also provides the travel of the person to a laptop console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo leads to saga followers and repeats the formula of the success of previous deliveries, consisting that the bigote fontaneer will have to run mined platforms of danger to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find newnesses in movements, environments, disfraces and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Column get the extra portfolio to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he gave the extra-trade of the ex-government Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy for the lavage of $70 million.
This ends the process so that Guatemala responds to the request of the North country that he claimed to Portugal to judge it there.
In the press conference, Colom acknowledged that his decision was obedient to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court had already ordained the extraordinary order.
He concluded that during his mandate, "He didn't put his hands" in judicial resolutions and gave traits to all extraditions he had known.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will be extradited by murder and serious lesions, and Edgar Moral Street and Victor Roads, both by drug traffic.
The work made by Colom is a executive trammite, then all legal and constitutional institutions will be exhausted to process the exhibitor between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portugal must be issued once he has solved his legal situation in Guatemala and is guaranteed by human rights.
Portugal was absueled by the deficit of Q120 million in the Defence Ministry when he was president, which was the process before the extraction, but the Public Ministry called and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6.000 young people in risk situation
It was born to avoid falling in the marginality of chicks without training
The balance of the first 25 years of social support Trinijove is important: 6.000 youths in risk of exclusion have received aid to overcome a difficult situation during this fourth century.
It adds the hundred long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to make balance in an act celebrated in the ancient complement of Fabra and Coats, who attended more than 300 people.
Trinyove was born in the Trinitat Vella camp in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, unemployment, with dogradiation problems or in the situation of falling in marginality.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu held a large number of responsibility for the institutions and institutions that have cooperated with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full-time electoral, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Along with the President of the Generality, Artur Mas, and its president Jordi Pujol, assisted the exconseller of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the extension of the high and current council Others, Ricard Gomà.
They also arrived to the large room of the Fabra and Coats the current conseller of the Social and Family Benestar, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of La Ca, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he acknowledged that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present is also, but added that the work done to now "is a good basis".
The president put Trinijove as an example to know how to fight bad circumstances and to give people hope with difficulties.
"The crisis is not a new thing for the work and the work that it is performing," she demonstrated.
Developed an ocuped finger where macro feasts were made
The invaders had joined 11 of the 13 stages of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the finger at midnight without providing resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the weight that lived by the 51 neighbors of the Balmes Street has reached its end.
Twelve people left the middle of yesterday voluntaryly the immobile that they were illegally occupied, and where they organized macro-feases that were unexpected to the neighbourhood, by judicial order and without need of a police intervention.
When the operation ended, the door lock was changed to avoid repeating the situation.
"From now there will be a access control," advised the administrator.
The ocups, who had invaded 11 of the 13 stages of the building - the rest of them are inhabited -, took all the installation and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leave residues of any kind, especially all the parts of alcoholic drinks.
The first three steps were the scenario of the multi-studentary festivals, which spent up to two days and despaired the inquilinians.
On the side of the building there is a discoteca, Balmes 51, which has also been seen damaged.
Her ownership, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has decreased 80%.
The ownership of the discoteca points out that the finch invaders would make him disloyal competition, since they sold the coppers to three euros, while in the discoteca value was 10.
Furthermore, the property of the occision site had to respond to neighborhood claims, while it was pointed out, the distress not caused by the discoteca clients, but the people of the ocupated house, and, especially, the attendants of the festivals that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity during the last weeks, are the angry neighbors of the area.
The responsibility of the discoteca explained that the troubles were so big that it even reached an agreement with the owner of the immobile and nine months ago "forgive him" the winner.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that during the last weeks he had received more complaints from neighbors for the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP at the meeting, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "removing the immobile immediately to end with the problems of conciliation and civilization producing neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one plant of the occupied building, but during the past months the occupations had gone into all the plants of the building and almost all the feet, and that in some case even stoles have been produced.
In this regard, he added, "the need to end with impunity and be constant against the incidence that has been born in the finger."
And yesterday, the Mossos broke a building in New Barris.
At 15.30 p.m., the police went up to the 35th street of Mont-ral, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed that four people had access to the building.
The four were arrested at the moment.
Park or Mount?
architects coincide with the opportunity of calling outside polemics on honoraries
The municipal concurrence on the 16 doors repeat the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Amediated in the 80s, in full appoge of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this printed a few promotion pasquins of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of Barcelona metropolitan.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in numbers, with the Central Park of New York.
With CMB's death, in 1987, the park returned, in the imaginary of many, such as the highest limit of Barcelona, as the Catalan capital of the few who are not oriented on the north-south axis but above (Montenear) - below (sea).
Collserola's qualification as natural park reduces this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with jabalises in the role of Yogi coast.
In these, it was until in September, the assembly invited a megacompetition composed of 16 concurrences for such gates of access to Collserola.
A door replaces the idea of park, no doubt.
Or that or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question comes alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The concurrence, both by its extent only organizational and by its proposal of reflection on the city, is the subject of conversation between all the barcellone architects.
It's almost a recurrent topic when two members of this old elected castle are recognised in an ascensor.
And this fact stands just to one of the few coincidences between three Barcelone architects, and university teachers, which have been presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the concurrence is appropriate.
For Roldán, after the litoral front "is necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", since the Talk of Ildefons Cerdà, the Green Mountains, has not been carried out.
"Call out of the base that Barcelona's most famous park is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," judges the architect for whom the title of "Coloro's gates" closes a "lexical trap": you must not think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where you have to act."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanist world, qualifys the proposal of "intelligent dress" with "certain dangers".
Peligros resulted from the "uncertain that it is today to project the public space" after the experience that was alive in the 1980s and that he had in the Forum area "at the edge of the cisne".
The first fear is the own delimitation of borders on where to be built.
"Limiting something is to fix the next step," that is, its oversight.
"You must think of new urbanism instruments, planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can stand to authentic disasters."
More fair to the question, Modol believes that, simplifying, the Valley Vertex of Collserola "can be understanded as a park, the Barcelona, no", for a question just topographic.
Modol recalls that there is already a work made by the Collserola Patronat that "not must fall in worst sack", although it appreciates the opportunity that the assembly offers his gremium to intervene in this project "from the first time".
Moreover, he understands that the neighborhood of the mountain with the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "duda" about whether this technical profile should be managed by multidisciplinary teams ("all an accurate", pointed out) that has to be created: "The architects should be only one tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that is entitled to this piece is fulfilled, because on the basis of the concurrence there is no global vision of Collserola: "16 transverse concurrences have been convocated in the meaning of the mountain-sea, but there is no long-term reading, which sees and understands the area at all."
This causes at least in the case of it that it has chosen to participate in the 16 concurrences.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can shoot in a program and definition with the architect of the door by the side.
In its opinion, yes, the assembly should ensure that the franja immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, in all its view, a area of equipment that had made a slow transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and will go out free
After 72 days of driving, the legal approved of the Casino Red received the permission to the brother of the Master of Monterrey of the process followed by the presumption of chantages
After staying 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal approved of the Casino Red would grant you the permission to the Second District Court of Justice, which follows a singing process against the brother of the Master of Monterrey.
After the attention to the Royale Casino, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of graphs and videos in which Manuel Jonás assumed to pay for a economic quota so that the regional assembly would allow the clandestine operation of the house of deposits.
After the public denunciation, the State Procurement opened a criminal process against the brother of the panic lawyer, and on 2 September he was arrested and dropped for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agency of the Public Ministry 3 in Patrimonial Crime, he was sent to the House of Arrigo 1, where in the Old Chamber of the State's capital.
In that place, it remained during the 49 days following its decree after the Department of the Public Ministry rejecting the organized crimes of cohesion and crime.
On October 19, Cadreyta's penalty was presumed to cross with a million and a half weights to the owners of the Red Casino; however, only a few hours remained in the median security prison because there were death threats against them.
The authorities allowed him to follow the internal judgment in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second District Penal Judge Jorge Yánez, who said that at nearly two months of discovery, sufficient evidence was checked to determine the responsibility of Jonas, such as the cover of 1.5 million weights to the representatives of the staff house in exchange to allow the operation of it.
This Monday, the legal approved of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, came to Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for permission for the brother of the neighbor of the region, so in the next hours he could recover his freedom.
The legal diligence, the officer of the Public Ministry, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and who of the staff's partners was the one who had received the loss, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the 197/2011 record, the legal loss is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and thereafter no complaint can be submitted in turn to the process followed; otherwise, there will be no repair of damage or penalty.
After the audience of the legal appointment of the house, nearly 15:50 was ordered the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton.
The Secretary of the Judges, Jorge Yánez, was transferred to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to notify Jonas that he was legally forgiven and his document will be held.
He shall also notify it of the immediate freedom order which the judge issued.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jacome gives details of the air accident where the Government secretary, Francisco Blake, lost life, and seven more people
The Secretariat for Communications and Transports (SCT) informed that the results of the accident in which the Government secretary, Francisco Blake Mora, lost life, and seven more people indicate that the helicopter was directly influenced on the ground in full integrity, without the pilot to have a forced landing.
A press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jacome, Secretary of Communications and Transports, mentioned that before deploying the nave, the pilot found that the climate conditions were appropriate to flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the asphs had contacts with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fusillage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, and that he had the requirements necessary for transporting the staff.
Furthermore, he said that in the investigations in the area of impact, the appearance of parts on the ground is not reported.
"In a search, there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented in a way.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, with appropriate requirements to transport passengers.
The land presents a seven-degree depth at the 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary assured that it was a priority to comply with the earlier possible results; however, the investigation could take several months, even to reach a year.
By its part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeroports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Major Presidential State operated in cruce speed and that this happened on a mixed ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cross operation at the time of the impact," he expressed.
At the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jacome, mentioned six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual air:
In accordance with the legislation, the flight has been carried out under the visual flight rules, which means that the flight and the land must be visible.
Horological conditions:
The reports in the AICM placed appropriate conditions for the swimming, according to the nave towards the limitrophe area between the DF and Mexico State, were presented low clouds.
Selected paths:
It is implied that by the cloud conditions, the trip has been searched for a smaller and greater visibility area towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar's nave are covered, probably before the impact was lost of control or change in the flight trailer.
Dispersion of residues of the nave in a reduced area:
The information available to this moment allows us to assume that the impact has occurred on a direct and side tragedy.
The pattern for the distribution of residues of the nave allows to assume that the helicopter was affected on the ground under conditions of integrity.
No fire or explosion evidence has been detected:
On the site of the sandwich, there are no evidence in the rest of the ship of any type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the research indicate that it could have had multiple contacts with the field.
The field works have been found in parts of the nave at a height of 9000 200 feet over the average sea level, the ground presents a penetration that goes from the seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The graphs show the sequence in which pre-developed during the course.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the minuciose search in a larger area than the agreed site, around the accident, there were no dispersed parts of the nave, which strengthen the assumption that the impact was presented in the conditions of integrity.
MSS announces a protocol to find obesity genes
The Social Security guides an investigation to discover the genus of obesity in children and youths; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that a research was conducted to discover the gene of obesity in children and youths, called the "Genetics of the Obesity of Children and Adultance" protocol, which will allow to account with super-peak-related marks.
In a communication, the Chief of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemical Hospital of Specialities of the National Medical Centre, Miguel ́z López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of medical, medical, nutrients and social work was integrated.
This team is supported by post-grade specialists and students of the National Public Health Institute (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Politechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research, it is invited to participate in the population whether or not, to attend the IMSS sports units in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out to minors, every Sunday at 8:00 a.m.
It emphasized that the Protocol was eating in the Quauhtémoc Sport Unit and that since 8 October the activity was carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sport Unit.
Once the goal is fulfilled to meet 500 or 600 smaller, the study will continue in the Sport Independence Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sport Unit (North of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this investigation is to know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young Mexican to prevent the appearance of degenerative chronic diseases.
When celebrating this 14 November the World Day of Diabetes, he needed the goal to meet three thousand children and youths between six and 14 years of age, with their parents' employment and supervision, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical and inherited family activities of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that cause suffering such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He detailed that the Sabbaths are applied to all participants of antropometric measurements (weight, height, circle concentration), blood pressure, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (required to identify genes associated with infant obesity).
López noted that this investigation obeys the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight increase in minors.
"The health investigations of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in only six years, in the case of children, 77 per cent in obesity and 47 per cent of the girls; in terms of overweight, a dramatic assessment was also observed in the case of children.
He indicated that the justification for the search of the bookmarks is supported by the population of the country is different from others for its genetic history.
He informed that in the average, Mexico has 65 per cent of American Indian inheritance, 30 per cent of Europe and five percent of African, and that is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and weight.
He explained that the genetic obesity is generally translated into the incapacity of burning the energy we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the integral evaluation of children, which allows to detect whether they have any over-essential or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark color pigs (acantosis) in the neck and front brass, which indicate the probability that the metabolic changes and even predyabetes are lost.
The information is reliablely handled, doctors give it in writing to parents, to whom each of the measurements and changes in lifestyle to prevent diseases is explained.
López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic sufferings: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of the television and use of transport media instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high calories, such as the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbonhydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, hamburger, etheter) with high content in grass and proteins and genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's asfalt would avoid baches
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the UNAM Chemical Faculty, develop asfalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, independent of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the ground were to be ́s, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 000 baches each season of rain in the Metropolitan Valley of Mexico, Rafael Herrera Najera, researcher of the UNAM Chemical Faculty (FQ), who ensured that if the process of building and maintenance of a asfalt ground is the appropriate, the baches could be reduced in quantity or even completely removed.
At its conference A technology opinion of the baches, depicted in the International Year of the Chemical Year, made known that the charge develops asfalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to asfalt, but with a greater mechanical resistence, both high and low temperatures.
Mr. Najera considered that this type of modified asfalts could be used in places where climate is extremely warm, such as some north cities of the country, to improve their performance and thus the formation of baches.
He explained that the asfalt, the weightest part of the oil, is a set of molecular molecular molecular molecules, called asfaltenes, and others of lower molecular weight, called Maltenes, which together give it to the ground their characteristics of viskoeleastic behaviour.
The viskoeleastic behaviour of the asfalt consists that at high temperatures, approximately 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, 120 degrees its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees presents a nearly strong state, while at very low temperatures, the asfalt returns to breaking, added.
The previous means that the resistance of asfalt in the streets is not uniform, but that it will be changed during the day in accordance with the environmental and temperature conditions, the expert warned chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City in most of them are inherited by flexible grounds, which consists of six rows of materials, of which the last three of which will involve asfalt.
Among the most superficial layers, the asfalt folder is matched by small sticked stones in asfalt and then compressed.
Each of the stones that constitutes the folder, pointed out, is bathroomed asfaltly.
By transiting the vehicles and generating efforts, this allows forces to spread very well in the ground.
If it was a modified asfalt, it would be even better spread, the chemical engineer thought.
On the asfalt folder, it was abundant, a last layer called rounding directory, which is made of a fine stone material, namely a sand that is also bathroomed in asfalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the vehicle lamps, it must have more mechanical force than the asfalt folder and provide friction on the road.
As part of the floor that will receive and spread the efforts, the rounding directory re-e, too, have the appropriate weight and should take care of the material that is done.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, because it affects the performance of the asfalt directory.
When the ground is smoking, the water spreads inside the directory and it is difficult to go out, it causes all the layers of the floor and thus the sharing of bottles.
In the process of sharing of a bache, he said, the first thing to get out is the road movie and only then the asfalt folder is affected, but the damage is not continually, but it is a process that should be addressed to the first signs with appropriate maintenance programmes.
The member of the National Research System also explained that vehicle burden is another important factor in the sharing of baches, and therefore the weight of each of the grounds should always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is fulfilled, to avoid forming of frequency bottles.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asfalt, for example asfalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and allow to repair the baches with facility and without need to use high temperatures.
What missed the Valley candidate to be the new lady Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that have made that Melina Ramírez Serna does not reach the crown of Lady Colombia.
The Valle receives its title number 14 of princess.
The Valle of Cauca remains again with the wins of the crown of Mrs. Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to comply with being in the podium of winners, lighting the silver crown and the band that believed it as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Mrs. Atlantic is located with the crown and cetro, the department already summed 14 titles of Princesa and Melina is one to the legion of vallecaucan women who have been near the coron, but who have been announced princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Domingguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pine (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garces Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today, the big question that many are doing is what's missing?
Because the result represents the damage of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Lady Colombia, the Queen of the Police and the Best Rostro Jolie de Vogue was chosen, titles that received Queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Lady Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision that the jury took to design the first root Princess that he did not convince with its answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Road Leamos.
The Vallecaucan answered the questioner:
"I read much, I believe pretty in the eye, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I'm definitely thinking that the book that marked me of infant is "The beginning," is a very deep book.
Now I read "Criminal and Penalty", is a universal book that we all should read; and today I read the book of Irene Nemirowski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The burner of blood".
A response that was little liked first by the term "culturalising" and second by not explicitly explaining how each of the books that he quoted it has marked it.
But when Melina concluded the ceremonie, she felt quiet and happy with the result "the universe is wise to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The beginning" is a great book"
Among the lanced hypothesis, it is said that the favoritism was burned in Valle.
A Bogotano journalist suggested that when being the preferred, ovationed and the candidate who had been carrying all the preliminary premiums (Oster gastronomy resource, the public vote for the best artisanal bringing, and Queen Mother), "is that wake up the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore didn't be on the scenario."
And that was noted in his first bathroom presentation on the beach of Hilton and his two dishes in the coronation wall.
Although it was safe in both of them, it was noted that he lacked the strength and impatience that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the programme "As in the house", of the CN channel, believed that Melina was appointed princess "checked that the candidate who wins most premiums during the concurrence does not remain as a Queen."
Moreover, Valle was shown to the last very squive with the press, and he wronged.
Another opportunity is that Valle has not been able to convince the jury about his interest in the social work, which is at the last, the essence of the National Concurrence of Belleza.
For something, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty showed that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their parents.
"The same beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which is already involved in projects before incoming to the Concurrence."
It is also indicated that Valle sinned for its defects in der ́e and fibrosis that he was noted in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury chose her as the candidate 'Nature' with the healthy, good food and physical work responsible.
The Preparator of Queen Jorge Hernán Orozco recognises that Melina had not the best body, which had better, "but her problem with fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very notorial, was down to her points on the last day."
In addition, the journalist Guido Hoyo, of the Cromos magazine, considers that the error of the vallecaucan was the surgery interventions that were practiced.
"The surgery is good, but the Valle is not aware of it.
Her body never was her strong, and here it was covered."
For this prize, which for the first time delivers the National Concurrence of the Bell, after the bathroom travel, a cruel Vatican was fulfilled last night, because it was said that this was the satisfaction Raymundo had granted Melina to not give him the pleasure of the crown.
Reality or no, it is true that Melina begins a year of rulership from today, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, the position of representing Colombia in one of the international claims by designation of its own national concurrence.
However, she will pass through the story as one of the Queens that, despite her roller through Cartagena, she was cut down the crown.
That was the work of the heat that identified the Alfonso Cano cade.
A lofoscope of Cali passed the story as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officers is key.
Last 4 November, a lofoscopeist of the CTI of Cali passed to the history as the man who confirmed the identity of the maximum leader of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", to the cottage of its digital holes.
Of the seven lofoscopics who work at the CTI section, that week touched the "disponibility" turn to Eliazar González, a 21-year-old Puerto Tejada man working in the court research area.
When he started his career, González worked in municipalities of the Chocó, where he often had to enter for more than five days in the forest to reach the site where the gifts should be identified.
In 2000, it was transferred to the Valley capital and, after performing the relevant courses, it was specialised in lofoscopy, which is the study of the friction skin, namely, of the hands and feet palms.
The week of the operation against Alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar was warned that she was taking a minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for you.
On Friday night, he went to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two gifts and that it was suspected that one of them was the man leading to the oldest warrior in the world, so they asked him to carry the card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his true name).
However, when he arrived with the research team to the site where the cadaver was located, he did not recognize it for its physical aspect, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without boat, dressed as a campsite in the area, without birds, and much more devastated.
But the winds don't lie.
Along with a galtonian, tint, a transplanter and a linterna, Eliazar compared the dactilar impressions of falling with the cards.
His eyes failed: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man originating from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming the Defence Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzon, who was the maximum leader of the Farc.
Searching for the floor
For a dactiloscopeist of the Sijân de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in the press race by the operative against "Can", is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactiloscopy is a precise science, without a mistake, which can be key to the resolution of crimines.
Besides identifying gifts, lofoscopistes support crime investigations such as hurt and murder and confirm identity of captured persons.
When they are captured, many criminals have seeds or have no papers.
We're taking the dactilar print and looking for them in the database.
The researcher told that, in a case of hurt, he touched him to remove a wall of a house, because there the ladron had supported his hand to take a strong box full of joys and money.
"The walls are hard because they are not suitable surfaces to take a dactilar print, but in that case we could get the wall of the whole hand and identify the criminal, who had participated in different hurts," he recalled.
Youths may also dismiss or rebuild suspicious in cases of murder.
Recently, they found a dead man with licor bottles around him.
The investigation determined that a family could be suspicious of the crime and, in fact, a floor in the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the murderer, he is located on the crime scene.
A dactiloscopeist of the CTI explained that in the objects "the winds are extracted with chemical or physical reactions".
When they appear, a transplanter or kit is used to lift them up.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or the Registration.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumentated Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He stated that not all is as shown in the CSI TV programme.
Like not all it's gold, not all it's touching turns back.
However, if it can be used, if the respective quota is carried out.
"Indignants" challenged authorities in New York
Hundreds of manifestants were hit by the Zuccotti place to camp.
A large part of the development order and moved to a nearby park.
The Ocupa Wall Street movement integrants challenged this Tuesday to the New York authorities trying to enter again, under the wide range of a judicial order, at the Manhattan place where they were deployed in the morning and trying to occupy another park of the Great Manzana.
Hundreds of demonstrants were attacked before the Zuccotti place, where they wanted to thanks to a judicial order that allows the "indignant" to return to camp at the place, while another part of the movement responded to the outcome by occupating a park more north of the city, where there were new detentions.
"Our idea is that, if the court doesn't allow us to go back to camp at the street, we'll install anywhere else and we'll continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as the seat and peaceful manifestations," said one of the portfolio of the "Occupa Wall Street", Mark Bray movement.
Bray detailed that the response of the "indignant" to the development of his camp, personally designed by the Master of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued a order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed demonstrants to keep camps.
Furthermore, the "indignated" went to the occupation of a new park in the confluence of the Canal Street Centers and the Sixte Avenida, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which a New York and New Jersey, and the property of the Trinity Church park.
At least for a hour they were able to occupy the place, but then the police arrived and went to stop some of the manifestants, even though Bray could not confirm the specific number, while he assured Ephe that he saw several journalists who were also married.
The organization assures that there are hundreds of people who have been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been moved to support the integrants of the movement and has tried to meditate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti place - which is a private property- remains closed at the expectation of celebration of a judicial view for this same Tuesday in which the legality of evacuation of this morning should be analysed.
Some of the demonstrants moved up to → carrying and distributing copies of that judicial order to these hours and even delivering them to the agents who kept the place, which caused the "small events", indicated Bray, who claimed that some officials had a golp to the manifestants.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to remove the members of the Ocupa Wall Street or to apply "the laws that have been published after the start of the employment or to restart the manifestants to the park with tents or other properties used before".
Colonel Bloomberg indicated before the press that, due to that judicial order, the city had suspended the re-opening of the space to the public and the manifestants, which he warned, however, that local laws did not allow them to return to install with campaign tents and to sleep.
The director personally defended the outcome carried out at the morning of the Zuccotti Place, a operation in which about 200 arrests were held and decided because the manifestants were "vilanding the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the place because it was being "to a place where people would not protest, but violate the laws and, in some cases, to do damage to others", because " Some businesses had been threatened" and neighbors were afraid "for their life quality".
"The development of this morning was awesome and shows that Bloomberg's fund is more interested in preserving financial interests than those of the workers and the workers," added the carrier of the movement, who accused the lawyer of "no respect for the freedom of expression".
The responsibility for "Occupy Wall Street" also indicated that they intended to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with Community and sindical organizations, to remember the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television ship
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian highlights, it will appear in the TV program "It's to Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", assisted in "Baywatch", cognited by "Playboy", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actor and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special of Canadian TV Christmas.
The CTV private television channel has announced today that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other Canadian highlighted, will appear in the television program "It's to Peters Christmas" on 1 December by giving life to a very particular Virgen Maria.
CTV has distributed pictures of the television program today where Anderson, also known by the broad distribution on the Internet of a pornography video that appears together with her husband then, the Möttley Crüe battery, Tommy Lee, appears clothed as the Virgin Mary, supporting on a pearl that represents Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comic of Indian origin that recently acted as a representative part of the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, appears as Joseph.
Besides Andersson and Peters, the CTV special shipmates relates to the Canadian song Bublé, who at the end of March march marched in Buenos Aires with the argentin model Luisana Lopilato, and is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called "starra" to the e_Kim Kardashian during one of its concerts in New York.
Japan reneces after the earthquake
The BDP grows 1.5% thanks to the domestic consumption and ends the fall spirit that started in March
Since the last month, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, yet convactive by the earthquake devastater who became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that suffered the Nipón country since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo encrypted material losses in $300,000, a struggle that, despite the difficult world context, seems to have been decreased.
After three trimestres of falls, the data of the Internal Bruto Internal Product between July and September served to pass page, definitively: the PIB increased by 1.5% compared to the previous trimester and 6% annually.
The recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also provides the highest growth level from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the reference to the purchase of madria to restore the areas that are sold by the sixth and the later tsunami.
In fact, enterprises increased their investment in 1.1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first retrocess after six months of uninterrupted expenditure.
However, the actual revolution of the Japanese economy is not based on the Kinesian impulse that invites to use the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - the infra-construction - to use deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan has especially wake up thanks to the development of household consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese BDP.
This variable scaled a 1%, emphasised by the increase in expenditure in vehicles, travels and busy activities.
The y's stigma
Tokio has been ordered to the internal market, when yen - the nipona currency - has become one of the "reverse values" chosen by investors who flee from the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbines of the United States, a privilege that weighs as a lease in the accounts of export companies.
With a stronger division, products are more decent in the foreign, a serious contrast to a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of the large technical groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, reached their weak results between July and September at the quotation of yen.
While markets continue to assist the EU periferic countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not decrease the guard.
"The risks that continue, such as the deterioration of some foreign economys, the impact of Thailand's inundations and the rapid yen inflation," said the Secretary of Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And, in fact, the perspectives are not encouraged.
The Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD) claimed that most of the Member States presented more negative signs of economic raring in September.
The indicator that predicts the inflation points in the world economy highlighted that the main powers are being breathing.
Since it descended four decades to the 100.4 points, before the 100.8 August.
The euro area, even under the average, was located at level 100, with eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Atenas refuses to feed the doubts
Papadimos says that the adjustments will be approved, but the conservators will not sign any written commitment
With the shooted periferic risk premiums and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parkings, Greece continues to raise the labyrinth that leads to the outcome of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consenso" of the new Heaven Transition Government is more taxed by Brussels' needs than by a genuine conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative for reforms and that the period of hundred days agreed in its designation might be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservator Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that it would not support new outermost measures in any case and repeated its need for new elections for the date provided on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the summary of 26 October," Papadimos insisted on opening a parliamentary debate yesterday that will promote a vote of confidence to the new Executive tomorrow.
A package with 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officers and new measures against tax eradication will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaria does not clear the doubts about its position: "We have committed us to help the Government of transition, but we have not committed anything else."
The Conservative Leader was a longer passion in its puls to the EU and the FMI, the agencies that should dislock the 8.000 million Atenas needed urgently, and it made clear that it would not give a good view to any letter of compliance with the adjustments.
However, the European Commission, which still has the impact caused by the Order of the Papandreu referendum, repeated yesterday that its need is firm: it will not dislock the aid if the new Government and leaders of the main Helen party do not sign "a written commitment without ambition and as soon as possible".
The Porter of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors will return "too soon" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what is needed to pay the sixth trame" of 8.000 million, although there is no final date.
The Greek wood has still a loop to mouse.
Lady Sofia: "There are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "president" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain " has reached a worldwide representative place in the role of Microfinances".
Queen Doña Sofia reminded yesterday that the country has become these two last decades in the second donor of the plant in relation to this cooperation instrument, whose " essence" indicated that it is root in being a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on confidence in human being".
The Queen invoked yesterday the V World Cumber of the Microcredit in Valladolid with the conviction that "no doubt" that this type of operations are " absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium objectives established by the United Nations with horizon 2015, and, "very particularly, in those who aim to reduce half the volume of people living with less than a daily dollar income, with which the "poverty shadow" is fixed.
Spain "continue working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all the resources of the planet, and to take this task with "responsibility", stated Donna Sofia, which hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating in the Cumber, which will be extended until Thursday, "will guarantee the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "too many achievements" and "too many challenges to which we are."
The Microcredit summary is not only as a forum of debate but also as the platform from which "two basic targets".
Thus, His Majesty explained that at the end of 2015, there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that hundreds of those homes are out of the poverty shadow where they are supplied.
The impulse in the concept of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world " has followed the road started for years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sophia as a "righteous act and recognition accordingly".
And it is that he described the father of this tool as a "wonderful idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know its loans policy on the ground.
This experience followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Costa de Marfil in 1999, Canada 2006, and "I could see the continuous evolution in all", explained His Majesty, whose link to this project was worth the qualification of the "Family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "poor baker".
Finally, the Queen of Sophia concluded its intervention by encourageing the presents to participate in the debate and search for solutions to promote the fight against poverty.
"Ethic imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Jiménez Trinity, warned that solidarity "is a ethical imperty" for all democratic states.
In this regard, I expressed that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries at times of economic goodness, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez believed that microcredits assume "a serious and rigid policy dedicated to eradicating poverty" and now "more than ever" the developed countries should work under solidarity criteria and not allow this to be a victim of recovery.
For Spain, the microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
On its part, the International Cooperation State Secretariat, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" to give "confience" to people "excluding those who are all closed the doors" and the Duke of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, gave the presents the welcome to a city that "opened their constraint doors of the solid spirit".
The CDU proposes to choose the European President by universal suspect
On Monday 14 November, Leipzig, the first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU), has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Canciller and President of the Democratic Party.
Initially, the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the issue was placed in August, in particular to satisfy military men who consider that the Government's policy is currently too strict with the Greek and could be in a future with the Italians.
The invitation on the Presidentship of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was approximately adopted by a singleness.
Of the 1.001 delegated, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes that, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Minister for Finance, show any doubt.
The key idea of Canciller, and of the movement, is summarized in a lemma: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe has peace, but also because "new million jobs directly from the euro".
For Canciller, "the time has come to open the road in Europe."
This could be demonstrated in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, even though it could also be able to deal with the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "do a face to Europe".
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the invitation adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
There is no doubt that the twenty-seven arrive quickly to an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain is shown enemy to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegates have made the proposal to weight the weight of each country of the European Central Bank Directive depending on the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
Anxious for the calmness inside its party, Canciller has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it is also not that he has won its congress near the "small" European countries or countries in difficulties to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the movement on Europe is a paragraph to the importance of "the French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentioned to France.
Besides the past.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle in Leipzig occurred.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating wounds for Napoleon’s army.
Fraudity in lowness by disease
After subsidies, the UMP and the Government commit an offence against lowness by disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Burdeos to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and to speak a discussion on the subject, already renewed since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
Furthermore, to accompany such an offensive that part of the will of rigorous abhorrence, but that still refers to an axis of the presidential campaign, most want to focus on the lows of disease.
Firstly, to implement budgetary recourse: the Government intends to impose the workers in the private sector a fourth day of absence before they are able to take the low.
Finally, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls in four days of salary, namely at least 15% of his income.
It is a measure that could rise up a wrath oil, but that would allow 280 million euros to cover, if not Les Echos.
Furthermore, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more yieldable achievement: imposing officers a day of absence without remuneration in case of low work (at this time, they have no absence before the three days they apply in the private sector).
While these issues are discussed, the majority of them again put on the table the subject of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuse of work lowness.
"They will be increased in consideration of the controls and, in addition, if someone is discovering a fraud, he must repay the quantities," Xavier Bertrand warned speaking in the RTL on Sunday 13 November.
Like in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem quite disproportionate for the reality of fraud in the field of work lowness.
In fact, since 2002, a constant monitoring of this issue has been carried out and several political offences have been launched that normally have produced fruit.
The French are not more than in the rest of Europe.
Let us note the national numbers with care, first.
In 2006, the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), more than 237 million euros were added to work lower performances.
In 2008, the French Institute for Research and Health Economy Research and Documentation represented 5% of the health expenditure in 2008, increased to EUR 11.300 million.
From this sum, 46 per cent corresponds to lows by maternity and work accidents, while 54 per cent is related to lowness by disease, a number of EUR 6.200 million.
Therefore, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took a average of 14.5 days of low work, before 17.8 in 2009, a study of the Alma Consulting Group.
A average that, of course, hides distortions: another investigation, published in 2007 by the Monster.com Professional Management Syria, showed that 75% of the 40,000 inquired French assalaries had not taken any low day by disease.
Another study, in this case of disease insurance, indicates that 37 per cent of lowness per disease had been less than 8 days in 2010, 22 per cent between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent between one and three months and 11 per cent were extended.
If we compare them to our European neighbors, the French workers are no longer intended than in other areas to carry low for disease.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of absence of work (as for health reasons as well as for other types) was between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in low diseases is not particularly significant in comparison with undeclared work.
Fraude has a very limited achievement.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls of low disease by more than 45 days.
In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM checked at 13 per cent of the 285.000 performed, that short-term lowness were "injustified or too long", i.e. 37.050 cases.
In the case of less than 45 days, under systematic inspections, 11% of the cases were considered "adjusted or unjustly; a number that, having a total of 1.2 million, was estimated to 132.000.
Thus, a total of 169.000 "injustified" cases are achieved among several million workers who have taken a low per disease.
There is no doubt an insignificant number in comparison, for example, with the work in black.
The Member of UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, would represent a loss of tax income between 9.000 and 15.000 million euros per year, which is more than the total cost of low subsidies and, of course, considers more than fraud in this last area.
Papademos: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This stated on Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before Parliament, and added that the hundred days granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve that objective.
"To make efforts to recover the economy, we need support for our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said Government Chief, who spoke his first public talk during the inauguration of the debate on the vote of confidence to Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions adopted during the Euro Zone summary on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, since "the residence of the country in the euro area" added.
Consequently, Papadémos has planned that the public deficit of the country would be reduced "at about 9%" of the BDP before the end of the year, after reaching a 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The de Â ́s new outermost measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the group, showed its support on Monday to the measures already adopted to get out of the debt crisis, but he warned that its party would not be committed with additional abstention measures.
"We won't vote for new measures," he said during a party with the members of its "New Democracy" party.
He noted that he was in line with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, as well as combating loss, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
A Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the FMI and the EU would not unlock the loan of EUR 8.000 without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the measures provided, Antonio Samaras answered that it would be sufficient and that it would not sign anything because of the external pressure.
A Committee of Experts which should be legalized for Eutanase and assisted suicide
Canadians live denying death, it is indicated in the Real Society of Canada
In the field of palatiative care, the Committee claims that governments, health assistance institutions and doctors cooperate in order to ensure the best paliating care, not only in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives refusing death.
In fact, only 9% of the Canadians are willing to talk to your doctor about the conditions they want to die and take provisions for this purpose.
It is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts in various areas, including ethical, legal and doctor.
This Committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code in order to allow assisted suicide and eutanase when the patient takes that option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To start, experts quote a recent investigation of the United Intelligence Economy that compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada is occupied with the tenth place, the study points out that "the medicalisation of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death".
With medicine or not, 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palatiative care, the experts selected by the Real Society of Canada are indicated.
And, although most of the Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end out in the hospital.
In total, the highest rate in this regard is the Quebec record, where 86% of the deaths are produced in the hospital.
As regards the delicate issue of Eutanasia and the sustained suicide, the report authors reached conclusions that did not match the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that he would not want to change the criminal code in relation to Eutanasia and assisted suicide.
However, experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or not constituted a criminal crime, have no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal crime has not caused a misuse of their application, such as the use of Eutanasia or suicide assisted with non-compliant persons or that they had not been given it.
Jocelyn Downie, with the report, was yesterday by teleconference that was more observed in countries where eutanasia and assisted suicide were not legalized.
"In Canada, Eutanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians, favorable to Eutanasia
Remember that 85% of the Canadians have already been spoken for Eutanasia, since they think that they would allow people whose death is next to allocate their suffering, an investigation of Reid is indicated in 2010.
Furthermore, 66% believe that legalization of eutanasia will not make sense that the life of older or discapacitated people is less valuable.
As regards those who have exercised aid suicide, 41% of the investigators believe that a process should not be started against them.
As regards the maintenance or interruption of health assistance to a patient, the situation is not so clear, if the authors of the report are indicated.
Furthermore, among its recommendations, it is suggested in the Criminal Code that the recovery of health cares, if legally acquired, is not a criminal crime.
The Committee of Experts also requests the form of health professionals in respect of the fact that a patient is assisting the end of his life without fear to make a claim.
In the field of palatiative care, the Committee claims that governments, health assistance institutions and doctors cooperate in order to ensure the best paliating care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to the paliative or terminal sedation, which is already used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered Eutanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts provide reservations
Other health law experts have already shown their reservations in relation to the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Real Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, has qualified for "extreme" the position of experts signing the report, among other things because the practice of Eutanasia is not limited to the terminal stage.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and has more than 18 years of age can ask for help to self-suicide," says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy on any other value of society.
However, adds that "in society there are labels and restrictions".
The health specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed its "fortunate opposition" with regard to the conclusions of the report, which qualified as "proof for Eutanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Real Society of Canada, is particularly judged by the lack of abuse in certain countries where eutanase and sustained suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon the power
I'm demanding a "complot"
Syria is still more here
The parties of Bachar El Asad appeared yesterday before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bachar El Asad was intensified yesterday, which, with Russia's support, resists and claims that there is a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened the sanctions against the European Union, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of Syria, have been demonstrated for the abandon of power by President Asad.
King Abdala II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader who asked President Bachar El Asad to "leave the power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already fallen.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should leave, besides creating the conditions necessary for a new stage of the Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, neighboring Syrian country, in an interview for the BBC.
On its part, the leader of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, complained that the mediation efforts carried out in Turkey from the beginning of a year with the Syrian regime have ended in a failure.
"Who are not in peace in the Middle East with his people and cannot satisfy them, they will leave," he stated by saying to Syria, neighborland, about which Turkey is adopting a more difficult position.
On its part, after the decisions of the Arab Liague and of the European Union, the United States have concluded that "the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime" has been strengthened.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab Liague and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting a tone more hardly" as regards the repression in Syria, Mark Toner, the portfolio of the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 citizens have already lost life and at least 19 members of the regime's forces in Deraa region in South Syria have been announced by the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights (OSDH).
Other two citizens have died "during bombards and tyrotees with heavy ametrators in Jobar" in the hometown of Homs, indicated that NGO.
The Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al Mualem, considers the country "forward to the end of the crisis".
Furthermore, he has reacted firmly before the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus of its functions, which is, in its opinion, "a dangerous step".
Syria "not will flake", added, guaranteeing that "the complots against Syria will fail."
After the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League currently studied a "civil protection mechanism" and wanted to send to 500 members of human rights organizations, military media and observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, also expressed its support for the sending of United Nations observers to contribute to protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, in its opinion, is closed in the "paranoia".
It is intended to celebrate a new extraordinary Liga in Rabat in the morning to establish the implementation of the crisis output plan adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, the recovery of the armed forces of the cities in the hands of opposition and the release of detained manifestants.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Serguei Lavrov, has judged the decision of the Arab Liague yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis output plan, although it did not show its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against .
Italy
Monti requests time for the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future leader of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested some time for the markets to form their team and to implement a programme that will include "offers" intended to recover lost credibility during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and has meet today with the universities and the patronal.
It would form a restricted office, composed of external technologies to Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad program with numerous sacrifices," Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the small Parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings after meeting with the appointed Chairman of the Council.
On its part, the President of the Chamber of Members, Gianfranco Fini, has hoped that Mario Monti would ask for a vote of confidence to Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr. Monti's presentation of a limited list, without doubt of a twelve ministers, to the Governor of State, Napolitan.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the bursatile markets and the obligationists yesterday, asking them about time.
In the "democracy, there are precise terms" to form a Government and prepare its programme, he stressed that it is "certain that the markets will be patient and will understand."
His designation by the Chairman was initially obtained the benefit of the markets, but thereafter anxiety was placed, particularly after an unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should create a team mainly trained by technocrates, even if he stressed that he would like to include "politicals".
The new Government must operate until 2013, on the date of the following legislation, considers.
The President of the Chamber of Members, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive the Parliament's trust vote before Friday.
Monti has committed that, when he takes the charge, he will work taking into account the emergency and the goal that Italy "require its protagonism" in Europe.
A portfolio of the European Commissioner or Rehn stressed that "with a new government, it will not change our diagnosis from the Italian economy".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective to achieve a budgetary balance in 2013, despite the outermost plans adopted in the past months, has requested the adoption of new strict measures.
The Italian "Chef of the Chiefs" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see her killing, also insisted on the need to impulse the economy, "as a country that does not grow cannot comply with deficit requirements."
Monti, whose competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), provides a "changing of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriality" and "Other Italy", are the editorialists.
The great ignorant will be the length of your team.
President Napolitan wants to avoid previous elections, since Italy has to put about 200,000 million euros in State obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has cooperated with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has cooperated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, a American NGO specialised in the atomic risk on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the International Scientific and Security Institute (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) and other documents issued by that UN Agency.
The IIEA showed its "great concern" last week for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
The ISIS, based on documents of the AIEA, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades since the 1960s in a Soviet nuclear center in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the production of synthetic diamants by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, it would have abandoned the center to form a company concentrated on the production of "anodiamants" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact the Iran Ebajada in Ukraine in 1995.
Afterwards, it was believed to cooperate with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the AIEA states that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, which was not only well-known with the technical, but also, a Member State has been informed to the Agency, worked during most of its career in that technologie in the military nuclear programme of its country of origin".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased 50%
Crime and crimes against Muslims have increased about 50% between 2009 and 2010, while the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only lightly, the statistics published by the FBI on Monday are indicated.
The total number of violence acts committed against Muslims has passed from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. to 49 per cent, with a increase of 13 per cent in the case of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4 per cent in crimes against Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent in the number of crimes and antireligious crimes.
The total number of "hate crymmes" has easily increased to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, is indicated by the FBI.
"With a decline in 2009, it is anxious that they have returned to increase this type of crimes and crimes," stressed the human rights defence organization first, "the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant," added the organization in a communication.
"Human Rights First takes a long time indicating that violence against the Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds a responsible for the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The Government can and should strive to end these abuses," adds, considering that these efforts could include a improvement in the reports of the police on the "hate crymmes".
"The crime of hatred" in the federal law and was inherited from the time of fighting for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish the acts of violence linked to race, the color of skin, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes your platform and seems more like Facebook
The Microbloging Twitter site on Monday presented its platform to allow your users, especially to observe the activity of those to whom they follow, which causes your service to appear a little more than Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another named "name" allows to follow more readable and directly the activity of other "Twittos", namely, those internally whose messages ("tweets") continue on the Internet or who follow you.
This allows you to know if you follow messages, if you are subscribed to new accounts, if you qualify any message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tried "with a small percent of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, the Twitter portfolio, Carolyn Penner, has been indicated to the AFP.
Twitter, who was known by his short-instinct functioning, with lightly esotheric terms (RT to send a message from another person, follow-friend to recommend following another user) which makes the happiness of the initiatives, thus opens a larger public with a more comparable management to the major Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the network, users have discussed "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's inutile, it's invasive and it looks too like Facebook," writes @jimb123.
"The function Activity will help me to follow some of my Twitter flows better," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "good rule" budget in the Constitution
The Government of Great Social Democratic/Christian Coalition in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a " gold rule" budget to reduce public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit ratification agencies (triple A).
It was the own Social Democrat Canciller, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a very higher number than the maximum of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly less than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced at one level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay 3.000 million more in interests each year," said the Democratic Democratic Vicecanciller of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus answers a request from the Brussels summit to the Member States of the euro area last 26 October: In it the State and Government Chiefs requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of public deficit and recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in an equivalent Law.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is approached to the "German Model", since Germany was the first European country who adopted such a "regulation".
Before 2017, the public deficit should be decreased by 0.75% of the brutal internal product (PIB) each year and, since 2017, the public deficit of the Federal State should not exceed each year by 0.35% of the PIB, while the regional States, as well as the communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective consists that the public debt is decreased by the 60% criteria set out by the Maastricht Treaty until 2020/2012.
A strong yen
Node threats with a new exchange market intervention
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Nipse authorities would re-interpret the marking of the change if the yen continued to grow.
"We will interfere, as we did last time, if we check that there is a volatility" in the type of change of yen, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen ascended to reach a number of levels close to the maximum of historical levels produced by the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokio sold massively yen per dollar to decrease the value of the Nipona division, which just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the currency and ↓.
But the yen has gone paulating since then, impulsed by the purchases of investors who consider it a "reverse value" in these uncertain world economic ralentization and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar to be cotted on Tuesday less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen under the 105-year-year sim rubber, reaching nearly levels that caused the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Nipona division harms exports from the lake, since it carries Made in Japan and reduces the value of income obtained by Japanese companies when they turn them into the national currency.
"Japan is fighting for rebuilding" after the sixth and tsunami of March 11th, who destroyed the region of Tohoku (norest), stressed Noda, fearing that the encarcement of the yen is cutting down the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter ( 1.5% in relation to the previous trimester) for the first time in one year, thanks to increased exports and consumption of households affected by disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of yen does not reflect the "Japan's economic bases".
The Minister for Finance, Jun Azumi, requested the Japanese Bank (BoJ), which initiated on Tuesday a two-day Monetary Policy Council, which adopted all possible measures to debilitate yen.
However, the added Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures" by understanding that it should not be expected a greater monetary flexibility on Wednesday.
At the end of October, the emission institution increased in five billion yen (47 billion euros) purchases of Letters of the Treasury, leading to 55 billion yen (519 billion euros) the sum of the funds dedicated to the acquisition of several financial titles to overcome the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the types grow, the bottles flaque
The risk of debt crisis is still damaging Europeans.
Despite the nomination of new Government Chefes in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth numbers in France and Germany, the types of weakest countries continue to grow.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area's stability, Europe's balls are a little more in the negative area on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 hours, CAC 40 loses 1.4% and is situated at 3.064 points.
Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and in London 0.1%.
"Regarding the new tensions regarding the performance of euro area loans in the most affected states, urban markets in the world continue to be part of their recent profits."
"The investors, nervous, are perfectly conscious of the risk of county," explains Terry Pratt, institutional corridor in IG Markets, quoted by the Reʹs Agency.
The Tokio Bolsa has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market interventors in relation to the capacity of Europe to contain debt crisis.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has a fixed view in Europe and exchanges will continue to be carried out in a decreased margin of changes, so investors will not have evidence that the situation has been stabilised," considers Mitsushige Akino, a fund manager in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
Reparement of concerns for the future of the euro area affects the unique currency, which continues to be decreased on Tuesday.
The euro continues at its lowest level since a month and a half.
For 10 hours ago, the European division was 1.3570 dollars, a fall of 0.4%.
The corridors have lost the value after the party of Canciller Angela Merkel, the CDU, which has been gathered on Monday in the Congress, is adopted a motion that provides, in particular, the option for a country in difficulties to get out of the euro area without abandoning the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types exceed 6%
The credit types of Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the 10-year Italian obligations reached 6.85%, while Spanish titles offered 6.2% at the same time.
These tensions relating to the interest rates of Southern countries, even though France, continue to feed the fears of interventors.
The leader of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested time for the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which takes the risk of accommodation with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, on its part, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Zone summary on 27 October would be the "main work" of its Government.
Spain is on the point of view of the markets, while on Sunday the legislative elections will be held there.
The difference between types ("spread") between 10-year-old obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
Waiting for euro area growth numbers
From the statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, which is a more favourable number than 0.3%, which is impulsed by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has reviewed the number of the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of the brutal internal product (PIB) instead of this.
Moreover, the fourth quarter is what really concerns the economicists.
Germany, on its part, has registered an increase of 0.5% at the same time.
The first provisions for the euro area are provided at 11 hours after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must be more valuable than dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be treated taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking of emotions, it is energy policy.
Electricity and the cost of electricity are directly affected by the acquisitive power and the company's ability.
It is appropriate that a electoral meeting is the time to reflect on these issues and on the location of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the sum of the economic, social and environmental impacts of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7.000 million people on the planet, the demographic development will duplicate the demand before 2050, unless a large part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, in order to continue to produce electricity, it will be necessary to paly the absence of more fossile resources to continue to produce electricity, without providing the imperial need to reduce inver-effective gases to fight climate change, a subject that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
That is not the case or Belgium, which is subject to the need to find a source able to substitute it, or from Switzerland, which only aims to build centrals of the last generation.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, quoting some examples, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, on their side, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to their park, restoring the construction of a central interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as example, the reality is against such speech.
The Berlin election will provide a carrying out the electricity price, a greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, in particular Russia, to increase CO2 ions for the construction of gas and carbon centers.
In a few months, the damage effects shall be noted.
• meditate on the case of Denmark.
Europe's campaign in the eological sector, of which 30% of its electricity, is also one of the large users of carbon and gas due to wind intermission; therefore, their CO2 and their electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to our energy policy, our neighbors have an electricity factor of 40% above the French homes.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor of energy and a guarantee for the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, the French companies benefit from the most economic electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would constitute a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would remain realistic to the wonderful statements on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of our acquisitive power.
It is a price that the major majority of French refuses to pay and, in fact, they do not show opposition in principle to this type of energy, the investigations are shown.
Remember that our country's energy policy has lost building a industrial sector with 125.000 directoral jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Extensively oriented on exports, it covers a galaxie of pymes specialised on international markets and that can create non-localized jobs.
If France had decided to leave nuclear energy, it would be the most of those SMEs and the loss of EUR 6.000 million annually in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electricist would be responsible for an EPR designed to operate sixty years when its manufacturer's deterioration is planned?
In order to solve the equation of nuclear energy, it is necessary to admit that there is no wonderful source of electricity production, as well as there is no daily source.
The development by the Areva of low CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions shows the additional character of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, the maximum safety level is not necessary.
In France, we have a Security Authority who exercises a strict and transparent control both on existing centres and on the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognition of professionality, are also held by security.
In the middle century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one of the Three Mile Islands has occurred in normal operational conditions; it has not caused consequences for people or environment.
In Chernobil, the accident was due to the design of the reaktor and to imperdonable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to believe that the accident was due to two natural disasters of an unfair achievement, which caused decades of thousands of people to die.
The nuclear sector will be of this accident, as he did from the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and constructors, the EPR provides a design to resist such phenomenon.
While all the actors who want to build a central, interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since they would leave them free to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be unresponsible to allow emotional, dogma and partnerships to dominate a so important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or a opportunity for economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized by parting from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services under the number policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of the "Music Rights" of France.
Recently, it is the administrative accusation of foreign students that has springed to the holders with the Ministry of Interior (see the magazine Liberation of 23 May) in the past that France "not needs for foreign talents, workers or friends".
However, it is rarely analysed from the economic point.
The question is that, on this subject, there is a lot of consensus between the left and the de.
In the case of the dee, Jacques Chirac made the orientation in 1976 declared that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with approximately two million immigrant workers", while at the left, the tone made Michael Rocard explaining that France "not can be charged with the whole world's misery" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the deeper feared the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Poland fontanes.
On both sides, immigrants are considered a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity they act with regard to immigrants.
In its programme, François Holland is limited to include banalities, indicating that the code-development will allow the "problem of the Property".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electable, but economically, it is very fair.
As the economicists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron indicate in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shape Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton & Press, 352 pages), there is a broad consensus between specialists on the positive impact of the flows on economic growth, salaries and employment in the countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration weaks growth and harms employment.
The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can submit national workers, especially to the few qualifieds, pressing to reduce their salaries.
However, experience shows that immigrants are actually more complementary than national workers' substitutes and are mainly exercising professionals in non-employed sectors.
Lowly qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attach national workers and most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet staff request.
A positive effect on salaries
Similarly, as a surgeon would have difficulty to work in a country with lack of anesthetics, the complementarity between national and immigrants causes the arrival of these recently to be positively affected by the salaries and employment of the nationals.
Taking into account the preceding, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase in 1% of the flows was an increase in real long-term salaries between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And, without prejudice to the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of Nobel and naturalized premies and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, since they offer a average 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
For example, the International Working Organization calculates that in Germany a 30-year-old immigrant will carry out a net (minor cost income) contribution of EUR 150,000 to the average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go seeking the growth points he missed "with the teeth".
Those teeth, which disobeyed the immigrants, had exactly the inverse effect.
Europe invented democracy, just needed to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a pretty good, but also fragil.
The European continent should be able to agree that, even though it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, during the 20th century has suffered the tragedies of the World War totally, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also France in Spain, in Salazar in Portugal, the crowns in Greece.
Some may have believed that, to ensure that democracy triumphs definitively against its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and the most directly possible way.
We know, from Napoleon the "Small," that was something thoughtful.
The universal suffrage, although it is a needed for democracy, is not enough for itself and can even become a "oppression instrument", as anciently said the Republican Philosophen Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy renew much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, a organization, a separation and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is a economic crisis, but it is going to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinodia of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: showed the need for a powerful return from the political area, but also the anxious feeling of its impossibleity, its incongruence.
Reflect on this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the lines of the front of the Democratic Battle are currently moved and that, in many cases, the Republican soldiers are no longer in good manner.
We will not win if we have a succession of national referendums, organized in accordance with the needs and in a disordered manner.
A white signature to the absolute European monarch or a high to the empty nationalist axe: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take effects, but a common exercise, full of right, quiet and continuous, from options and democracy, this time at European scale.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (we would actually not know where to end the list), because there is only a crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The entire Europe is the one that is attached to the orders of markets and qualification agencies, which suffers its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe who suffers a humbleness in the international area.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe who slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent is that popular sovereignty recovers the timone of the European project.
Because only together the Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free from the markets and prepare their future through investment.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at European level that will not be able to take without a total democracy legitimateness, unless it is to lead us to the disaster.
After a long time fighting against this proposal of socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone now asks for a European economic governance.
Let it be.
But think of it without a greater political and democracy integration, and without being living like this by the citizens, it would be a new crazy and would lead us to a new dead point.
We are taking a new stage of the European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "build" republicians.
The Revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We are building a more integrated Europe from the economic point.
Only it can be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a real European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let's do Europeans.
Cards with "uncontact" chip are generalized
The world room of the chip cards starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with a optimistic environment.
In fact, 2011 should end with an increase of 11% in the world sales of microprocessor cards (Cartes, SIM cards phones, etc.), with a total of 6.000 million units, is considered by the Eurosmart office.
The most powerful segment is the of the uncontact technology, which allows you to abbon the transport in common or purchase simply approaching the card to a reader.
This year will be sold over the world 460 million cards with uncontact chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its quota should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units) and represent approximately 10% of the world market for chip cards (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been delayed with regard to the Asia-Pac region, wins land in the payment sector without contact.
Approximately 26 million cards Visa are already available to this function, which is accepted in 75.000 payment terminals.
In France, your starts are more modest: 400,000 cards Visa are used without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact this year.
However, it is necessary that the customers provide them with the above steps.
"There are two large French facilities that have been committed to systematic distribution in the future, among their customers, uncontact cards from the system," Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
They test the payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the middle of the future payment: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC technology (Near Field Communication), indispensable to perform transactions.
"They're rejecting."
"But I should finally experience a real growth in the next year."
"Let us predict that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But they're taking the front.
The agricultural credit announced yesterday the testing between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 clients and partners will be equipped with a fund that allows uncontact payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marsella.
And the General Society also yesterday has prepared for the marketing of a offer that allows its customers to pay without contact to its mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, terrorist front is increasing
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb and Boko Haram Section.
The links between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Magreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which had been suspicioned for a long time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Viceminister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Mesahel, even suggested that Algel already "he has the certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and the reports of the intellectual services show that they are working," explained, without further details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The research on the two French sequestres in Niger last January would have renewed the passports.
Rapted in a Niamey restaurant by persons related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Del• died the next day with several of their sequencers during a operation launched by the French special forces.
In the springs of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several phone chips belonging to terrorists.
Eye of terrorists
The study of the calls shows several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
Se Se Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers captured particularly the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city from the north of Nigeria, with Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, probably, is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but we must certainly expect to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We know that the sect has enjoyed external and intellectual financial support since years and that it is always more active," Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
These recent months, these "supports" have been more evident in the evolution and talks of Boko Haram or in its operational ways, which now involve the use of increasingly completed explosive devices and the same style as used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting by Washington, has since then pressed Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities actually take time to consider the group as a community of little interest-worthy iluminations.
Quick success
Based in 2002 in Maiduguri in turn to a mixture, a school and the fundamentalist imman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which, in hause, "the west education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of a islamic emirate in the north Muslim of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is living a quick success.
Policy is and requires a close respect for the sherry, while its soldiers are launching the fight against the wicked central government.
These last ones are first guided to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's soldiers were particularly active and the attacks against the Commissioners were multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as often passed, generalized.
The army attacked the city and 800 dead were recorded.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect radicalizes and leaves its fires from the north.
The past Christmas, revenge an attention that causes 80 dead in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, particularly against the protected police general quarter, with a suicide attack, the first of this type.
In August, the United Nations local seat becomes its first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, concerns all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and that Al-Chebab's Somalians operate in Kenya, Boko Haram arose as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a dictionary in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned you against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "split all the information".
The world is responsible for the Republican candidates to the Presidency
In relation to China, with Iran and with the help to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A America weakened by the crisis, could a world be managed with simple ideas or, even, simplists?
Listening to the Republican candidates for the presidency, electors might think that it is.
Since a few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other candidates have made more powerful statements and accelerations on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The lems, often infunded, are extended on China, Iran, assistance to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the carrier to the designation by the "Grand Old Party", threatened to bring Chinese to the WHO and declare them "for the manipulation of their division", a key topic in a America exacerbated by the entire fragmentation of their sector to Asia.
Since that involves the explosion of a trade war, he was aborted.
Jon Huntsman, ancient Obama Ebajador in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of external policy, is almost stuck before a "pabulla" emotions.
You have requested a firm but constructive dialogue with Pekín (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who remains this in the depths of the sonds, is still inappropriate.
Reagan style
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions cannot interrupt their nuclear programme.
"If I get out of the choice, I'm going to Iran," he fascinated.
"If Obama gets reelected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase the military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations in relation to that partner.
Herman Cain, the second best classified candidate, shows by his part a shameless ignorance of these subjects.
Recently, he urged to oppose the Chinese military threat because Pekin "intentions to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China already has a military atom since 1964.
The Tean Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says, on his own, he is willing to expand the army and in Mexico to fight drug cards.
The resource to torture against terrorist suspicioned by Obama in 2009 also preconceived Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the Republican candidate, John McCain, a weight in external policy.
The opposers of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Friday War.
They recall that Obama's own was an affair and that he had to deal with the piston on the fight against terrorism.
They are reasonably involved in the failure of their great dialogue with Iran, in the predicted output of Iraq's "boys" and in their terriversations in Libya, and they label it in weakness.
But attacks are not simple to them.
The population judges more positively the national security balance of Obama, which ended with Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it was disconfied of military interventions that generate a hunger.
And argumenting that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more righteous.
North Stream, new Russian Gas input gate in Europe
The North Stream gas, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea Fund, has already been served.
Provide gas to meet the needs of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a great pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four State and Government heads, participated in Baltic ears, between the orchestra music and a delicte bufet, in the injury of the North Stream, the new gasoduc that directly communicates, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Yes, German Canciller Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his homologe of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have turned together the volant of the vault that controls the Russian gas entry into the Western Europe network.
With this new gasduct, more than 27.5 million cubic metres of Russian gas will be reached each year to Western Europe to a first hair of ≥24 km that communicate the region of San Petersburg with the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be concluded at the end of 2012 that will allow a total of 55 billion cubits of gas, namely enough to cover all French consumption.
Moreover, it is already spoken of the possibility of building a third tube by the same running.
For Gazprom, the finalization at time of this huge work represents victory areas.
Poland and the Baltic countries were strongly opposed to the project.
In fact, the North Stream will allow Gas directly to Germany, avoiding land transition by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
In fact, these two countries lose something of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia threatening it to close access to the markets in Western Europe.
At the aggressive point of the debate, Varsovia did not doubt comparing the North Stream as a "new brother-soviet covenant", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
I mean, if the issue is politically delicated.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater supply security.
However, the price is a debilitation of energy Europe, since the project has generated a break between East and West Europeans.
In only five years, Russia has known to triumph its vision of a direct association between Russia and the rich west countries, large gas consumers and more limited reservations.
"This gas is a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that is our organic," François Fillon confirmed during the insurance of gas, demonstrating how large gas sector contracts are as political as economic.
All this explains the wide smiles in the faces of Gazprom's guides, numerous in Lubmin, at the coming point of gas.
The construction of this gasoduc is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement re-seed to protect it against the anchors of the ships.
It is supported at the bottom of the sea, a average of 200 m depth.
In order to build it, it was necessary to avoid mine fields given from the Second World War II.
"It was necessary to recover or destroy a hundred of them by caution," says Jens Mıer, the Porter of the North Stream society.
Moreover, it was necessary to extinguish the protection measures for fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal serpent weighting as 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in all its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was intended in Sweden's waters, but the responsibles of the project refused to see that Sweden were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to be established permanently in the sea against their coasts.
"If we had to know, we will interrupt the gas pass in less than a minute," needs Jens M.
In the case of flight, gas gas will therefore be released to the atmosphere.
But the builders are not thinking that a flight is produced, since they have planned that, if the provisions are, they will have a flight every 100,000 years.
The control of the gas status is guaranteed by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, which performs external inspections, and by a device that is within the gas.
With the form of a pure, it is introduced inside the tube, which has a diameter of a metro, and is moved with the gas.
At its arrival, after three full journey days at a speed of three metres per second, it provides precise data on possible metal deformations.
Gas has been designed to work for fifty years without any type of repair.
Gas halting is simply guaranteed by pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and, at the output of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined their forces to be able to implement this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which has 51% of the participations.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Netherlands Gasunie and the French GDF Suez Group (9% each).
These five companies have created a common company called Nord Stream, responsible for building and exploring gas.
He has his seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favorable.
Afterward, Gazprom gained that company, during a period of twenty-five renewable years, the total gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the quantity of gas that is actually transported," needs Jens Mâer.
The financing of the gas construction has been completed at 30% with the contribution of the gains and 70% through loans.
The total cost of the work should reach EUR 7.400 million for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But the minorists are sure that they will not exceed their investment, because Gazprom only assumes the risk of expenditure.
The gasoduct comes from the Baltic in Lubmin, in an aranous coast planted of pins.
Some walls, with 4,5 meters height, form the gas output door.
There are sensors that measure pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas to the arrival before transferring to the German gasoducs.
Since Tuesday last, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
The total capacity will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a mark book.
Created a half a century ago by a Italian company, Moleskine wants people to enjoy writing.
He has an aventure air, of hours of writing to the light of a wheel.
The Moleskine book is easily recognised, with its black rectangular pastas, its gome, its white white sheets, as old for time.
However, the Moleskine books with the current aspect were born... in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo Company, based on Milan, decided at that time to launch the market a design book, but different.
Maria Sebregondi, who then consulted the company, was responsible for the new product.
The book is inspired in an ancient production technology, the skin mole (top skin), which refers to a barrened cotton that was used, inter alia, to cover the bankets.
This type of book was very appreciated by the writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current pleasure an old and vivid object, an icon of the vanguardist artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, which since then has become responsible for the mark in Modo Mode.
And reach the success.
Since 2006 to 2010, sales increased in 26%, until a total of 12.7 million sold units reached.
The confidential production of the first years has remained far, where only 3.000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attaches both business men and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, your users are cosmopolite, open spirit and worship.
The small Italian company, who had twelve workers at their starts, now has approximately 100 and has two offices since 2008: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes its quarters in libraries, from the Fnac to the small trades in the centre of the cities, and he has been able to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the time and the need to write, despite the e-mail growth," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature comes from the hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the mark has launched the "Detour" exposure where architects or artists exposure their own quarter.
In August, Lan ́a square with leopard tapes, for the reason of the Locarno cine Festival.
By using your success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has learned to diversify its products: bottles, agendas, boligraphs, computer backgrounds... The mark covers a wide range of supports.
A success that causes envidia: in August 2006, Modo was bought by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, currently Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the Moleskine history.
Why is the rate of stops of the disabled workers still so high?
Approximately 19% of the disabilities are looking for employment.
The XV Week for the employment of the disabilities begins today.
Despite a resolved public policy since 2005, the rate of unemployment between disabilities doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, before 9 per cent of the population.
Did you disappoint?
"No," It's Blanchet, Director-General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabilities.
"The progress achieved since fifty years has been significant.
"In that time, the rate of unemployment was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"But, it still remains much to do."
It is important to note that unemployed employees continue to have a number of obstacles to employment.
They are likely to have a growing age: 37% is more than 50 years ( 17% average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished the bachillerate and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, the long-term pair is very extended between them: 53% for the disabilities, against 38% of the average.
That is, there are many issues that are particularly difficult to return to the work world and that "constitute the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a partnership created in 1992 to help enterprises to contract disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
Moreover, there are those who are not mentioned; people's mentality goes on, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise Association for the City indicated that the investigated directors have "a level of knowledge of low disabilities" with a "representative representation of persons in roads, physical or intellectual deficits".
The result: Private companies with more than 20 workers are very far from the goal of contracting 6% of disabled employees, the objective set in a law of ... 1987.
The latest available numbers, which date 2008, are achieved by 2.6%.
"Now we are reaching 3% in turn," states Pierre Bla, Director-General of Agefiph, the body responsible for recovering the contributions of companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the "subordinated to this contribution" establishment number, as well as the payment amounts, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, by 59.000 to 46.000 euros (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Law of 2005, which increased the contributions, has generated a great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Bla.
"But this improvement also reflects a true consciousness, especially among the large groups."
The Ministry of Work is only 59 per cent of the companies between 20 and 49 employees with disabled employees in their model, compared to 82 per cent of 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy"
In order to guard the Bleus on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that generates this friendly party.
We will not attract to say that conviction was noted between them, but the image is yes.
At the street of the State of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after the recycling gesture of his front against Turkey, the Belgian elector has no more than elogies for him.
"I am very glad for Eden, for its progress and for Belgian."
"I want to go forward," answers Lille's front.
As regards the contrast between its presentations in its team and the selection, "is a set" has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all the year, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to have me."
Convocated to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this party against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis for, finally, "brillar".
We're not witnessing the "place".
She has been encouraged by the Bleus since she was seven years old, as well as during the victory campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan."
This will certainly strengthen particularly the "special" character of the meeting.
Especially because "the Matthieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)" will be held.
"We've just done a while ago.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made his part reference to "orry".
"Orgullo" for discussing "a galla game".
"Orgullo" also for checking, like "neighbor", that France "never becomes a very high level team", about a year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Bla's done a wonderful job," he enthusiastically said.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be pleased to make a fly with the Blues to the... Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something; players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You will be able to see it in the next parties." Including the party against France.
Portugal shows much confidence
Portugal of Paulo Bento is with a great optimism to the return party against Bosnia (22:00), which will be celebrated on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the ida game, both teams missed realism.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, especially, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the election, which leads since September 2010, will be qualified for Eurocope 2012.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate from lucky in Portugal.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to break.
Taking into account the ida party (0-0) on Friday at Zenica's fever, it seems evident that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the party for more than one hour, yes, but couldn't mark the valuable gol that he had given him peace.
"It's a good result, but at the same time he's getting a risk, because we've not marked out of the house."
But at home, in the Lissabon Light Station, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before a public that should be equal to enthusiasm, even if it is evident that the party "is very equal," said a optimist but lucid Bento.
"We hope that the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the front," reported 42-year Portuguese trainer.
"We continue to have 50% of the possibilities to participate in Eurocopa 2012," however, the Carlos Queiroz follower has been related.
Wednesday Empire in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to mark and win.
Bosneys could get an empathe, although they also need to mark.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it takes a risk, because we haven't marked out of the house," Bento regrets.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality," he added.
Like in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exercising, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the bosneys to "not leave them time to think".
A good idea, when, this time, is realistic.
