Parliament does not support the amendment to the freedom of Timoschenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament rejected the attempt to cancel the article sentenced by the opposition leader, Julia Timoschenko.
The amendment that would lead to the freedom of the former Prime Minister was rejected during the second reading of the legislative on the mixture of economic offences.
In October, Timothyno was sentenced to seven years for the signature of a gas trade with Russia, which was recognised as unfair.
The sentence is still not important; the Court will consider the accusation of Timoschenko in December.
Timochenko claims that the sentence is a political status of the regime; the process was also suspicious in the West.
The proposal for a cancellation of Article 365 of the Code of Procedure, for which the former Prime Minister was condemned, was supported by 147 members of the Parliament.
It would require 226 votes for his war.
Libya's Victory
In the history of freedom, or rebellion, Libya is already lost.
Muammar Kaddafi was buried somewhere in the wilderness without him.
It's time to determine the winners.
The islamists are usually winning in the country; the question is that they are measured or radical.
The transitional Government announced himself as a follower of the ordinary law of Shariat, which we have already heard.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the punishment for stealing is the cutting of hands.
Women may forget emmansion; the potential of religious rebels will be punished; etc.
Instead of the dictator society consisting of opposing clones, the Coran will be united.
Libya will have a order that we can't do, and we'd like to want ourselves.
Whatever happens, our lifestyle is not the only one in its own kind, nor the best and the best, for example, the people of Libya.
In fact, it is amazing that the Islam warriors have accepted assistance from them.
Their only advice is that the NATO's flights were not the American General, but Allah, whom they praised after every attack.
And if you are looking for winners in Libya, the West is not in their number.
We participated in shots, served Islam, and our politicians were released from the dictator, their political union, without any guarantee of advantage.
In view of the recent critical experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided to reject the military occupation of Libya.
The local population should therefore not be concerned about the expulsion of crossnotes.
Although without an occupation, will the oil company receive Libya's black gold almost unvaluable?
It's probably not getting, and the West will finally be able to be able to be inutile by protecting civil rights.
If only Shariat's followers do not end this.
The new whale of Crisis begins
France and the rest are currently in the centre of investors' attention.
The statistical storm was spent on Tuesday.
Where the country is found in the 3st quarter of the UNDP.
In comparison with the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in the state of detention, Germany and France demonstrated growth.
However, the long market is running records today.
Investors are not only looking at Italy; they are now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical office of countries in Germany, the Republic of Czech Republic and some other countries have discovered their previews of economic development in the third quarter.
Dutch GDP has increased to 0.5 per cent expected; France is 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also corrected data on the second quarter where the fact was better than expected in Germany (in 0.3% place of 0.1%). France reported a small decrease, 0.1% (basic information was estimated).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech Economy on a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, in comparison with the previous quarter of the BDP, the Czech Statistics confirmed the trend to graduate economic growth.
Results were worse than the analysis predict.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech Economy on a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was in a position compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, German economy increased by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy and the regions and the Union's demonstration has increased in comparison with the previous quarter of 0.2 per cent, which corresponds to the analysis forecasts.
Greece's economy was a preliminary decrease of 5.2%.
Its 10-year-old liabilities are 28.45 per cent.
The eligibility of both Italian and Spanish obligations approaches the critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., begin to face difficulties.
Despite the deterioration of the situation in the region, the income of Czech 1-year-old obligations remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is the last creditor that can save the situation.
The Czech Collection has passed the team to the Euro.
In Montenegro, they won a number of 1:0 and celebrated an unexpected daily price of 200 million.
The National Team has succeeded with the most complex task of the season!
Thanks to the beautiful Chech and the beautiful neck of Peter Iraq, they won with counting 1:0.
In the second time, the Czech team was welcomed to maintain a significant benefit after the home responsible catch, and it would again participate in the campaign.
IHNED.cz observed the walking of the catch and with a detailed report.
Almost nothing notes in the first time and great happiness in the second.
The Czech National Collection, partly because of the destruction of the team at the end; the Great Czech; and the Herotic Iraque; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated the outcome of Championats.
The excellent defense of the Czech team has allowed the Team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovich and Schoolish became the most unfortunate couple of shoes after two excellent opportunities were lost.
Great Peter Czech is one of the reasons that the Czech National Collection will not lose Championats in the year, and the Czech football is about 200 million Czech crowns.
The game was very stressed since the first minutes.
Both teams have experienced difficulties with combinations; most of the time has been played in the field center.
This also explains the lack of pressure by the first team of the masters, and the further attacks on the defence line were accurately captured by the Czech Protectors.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a living shield.
A few hundred students of the University have created a living shield around the atom electricity in Iran.
They therefore want to express their support for the nuclear programme of their country before the possible attack from Israel.
On Wednesday after the students before input in z followed the request for losses both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, a few hundred universities students have created a living shield around the Isfahan Airport for the Riquest of Uran.
Thus, they demonstrated the preparation to protect their country's nuclear programme to the price of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Nuclear Energy Agency (MAGATE) showed that everything proved that Iran did not leave the attempts to get nuclear weapons.
The potential attack on nuclear objects in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Monday, students before the entrance of the Uranian Riquency Battle followed the request for losses both the United States and Israel.
In the case of the attack on Ma's small paralysis of the Iraqian nuclear programme, the Israeli press will be the institutions, both in Ispachan and in Natanze, where the urian riches are concerned.
Question of children suffering from breast-feeding: No breakfast and breakfast for dinner
More than the third children of 9 to 13 years are weakening more standards; while 9 per cent of schools are weakened, 5 per cent suffer from breast-feeding.
According to the last studies, children suffering from breathing usually occur from families leading to an unhealthy life.
We reveal the importance of the environment and the behavior models associated with a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, the colobase appears on the tables of children suffering from breathing, almost twice more than in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children suffering from breast-feeding eating a carthole free for the deadline of an investigation related to educational activities referred to as Azerbaid is not a accident.
Moreover, children suffering from breast-feeding families are not involved, however, most of the family of modern schools have only 15% of children said that their parents have time for a job at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of the past school year, and there were almost 900 students of the beginning class throughout Bohemia.
Business Agriculture is not an accident in the second year, with the support of the Insurance Company General Health Insurance and Unilever.
There are now more than 12 000 students who have 4 to 8 classes.
Regular food and adequate burden I are the main determining factors that cause an effortful number of children who suffer from excessive weight or breast-feeding.
"For example, only half of the demanded said that they eat five times a day, on the breakfast-process-process-trace dinner scheme, which is one of the unchanged feedingstuffs," says one of the findings.
No bands and colbas at evening.
Experts warn that even such details are important for health development, such as the constant breakfast.
In the Czech Republic only 23% of school families are living together.
In most families, everyone is vacant.
The worst opening has been that people do not break in each tenth family.
Yet, breakfast is the basis for the right daily ration.
The study showed that feeding food is more frequently used in families with children suffering from breathing.
Almost everyone, independent of the weight, drinks sweet drinks every day (70 per cent).
Although more than 40 per cent of children are regularly occupied, this number is decreased by more than two - to 15 per cent - when it comes to their parents.
Build your own menu.
In the other part of the studies of the students (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) it was proposed to compose their own menus, from the proposed products and based on their pleasures and pleasures.
"Preferences in food in the Czech Children in age 12 to 15 are far from the idea that it is cossing healthy food."
Their favorite food includes a large number of painful, fleshly and sweet foods.
"Personal anxiety causes a large population of sweet cold drinks," says the final part of the investigation.
As a primary feeding feed, the pasture won a bird with a small wheat.
However, children were almost not interested in bovine, fishing and fruitful foods.
Endeavor to a healthy life
The investigation also showed that children were willing to change their habits in food when they were given the relevant information.
"Multium participants of the investigation group demonstrated a significant decrease of the preferences to healthy food when they completed the investigation after the lection of the Exhibition is not a accident," says the draft outcome.
This was particularly noteworthy, for example, in the case of sweet cold drinks -- more children were preferred for water.
The additive as a primary food, the children often observed birds and fish, with the number of sweet foods and wines.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, approving professionals
In the first article on the training for stylists, I visited information in the introductory business.
I didn't understand what would be next.
Lessons of three experts in this area; clothing advice for non-standard figures; and the seminar on how all of this works in real life.
Next is more.
As far as we are closer to the final examination, more information and practical tasks are expected.
Training goes on every Sunday and Sunday, but he is really saturated by an inevitation.
This time with Allenka, director, (no man in the course) we discussed how to clothe a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetric.
Most women are not completely symmetric.
One short neck, another little shape without appropriate forms, another weighs more standards.
The stylist needs to know how to decrease the wide shoulders, cut the neck or add the missing volumes.
We have advised how to highlight the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, which is the property of a more larger breast-feeding and the weaker and the weakness of the Tali, and that is not clothing them too excitingly.
For example, if the difference in the range of the Tali and the beer is so big that it is to cover a bubble or a bridge, it should have at least one thing that is in order.
You're not obviously regreting the added means because the perfectly sitting clothes are unvaluable.
You will feel much better in the tube, in order, than in the one who keeps walking, getting stuck, covering the tail, etc.
Children's facilities, on the other hand, may be dressed with rubbers, applause, highlights or stocks.
Taking into account the abundance of such information and types of figures, I'm glad that I have a whole week to understand all of this.
Yet, I'm afraid it's too much, taking into account the household we got.
Each party had to take two orders for any interest: daily and evening.
We must share their modern look, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I'm supposed to dress Miranda Kerr, you can know about the Victoria's Secret campaigns.
I'm glad for myself because it's much easier to clothe it than, as we say, Britney Spires, Christina Agiler, which has recently been corrected to a ton ( Please mean I'm overwhelming) or a very young Selene Gomes.
We have to cut out of the magazines or find it on the Internet, print and process with graphical programmes.
Mudboard is called the result of work - then reflects our own style and relationship with the image.
It is important to maintain a graphical composer style.
The stylist is not simply clothing real people, but creates products pages in the magazines (based on indications, such as mode boxes, paints, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Camenic told us about.
But it was just Sunday.
The stylist needs general knowledge
The subsequent lesson of the figure types was raised by three specialists in this area.
Stilist, Hansa Pocorny; modal designer, Jacob Poland; and modegraph Ben Rench.
Jacob told us that the mode is an illusion and a stylist must use this fact.
A good stylist knows one object of clothes and makes it different.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, the ballo-trench can be born usually, the top of genes and footballs like a balloon; but it can also be weared on a glass body, without a trace, as a floor.
Another possibility is to cut the hands or rise the door, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with him," he stressed.
Whatever, I am most appreciated the advice: "You must know the rules for your work."
Then you can start to hurt them," Jacob said to us.
Here I finally understood why we are going to buy all the definitions and rules, and why and why, while in modern magazines we often see a very different thing.
Don't talk about modesty shows.
From Ben, the graph, I learned that the stylist must have more options than the number of graphs he needs to do.
Yes, for a modal review of ten pages (equivalent to ten sets) I should be ready to create at least 15 images.
Now I also know that the object of clothing is often looking and working in relation to others is not as real.
We must mean that when we create a picture.
Hunza Pocorney confirmed that the image and style often are half success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have a vulnerable wallet, but her image and marketing turned her into a world star.
Relationship with the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cold.
Even the people often think that it is unexpected (and they believe that it is enough to be a specialist in something and how they seem to be secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to call us a different (slower) size than the one they really wear.
Then we go to Google and find out whether the tables have written something about something that has been famous/successful, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist was not enough to be discussed in the mode and able to be able to deal with the order.
Our work is mainly communicating with people we are clothing; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
In order to make people aware, do not cultivate them and keep their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to watch her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can't throw out the whole guardrob, saying to her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things that you can praise, and advise that you can carry with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that the slave should be moved specifically.
It's the bottle you're connecting around the Tali to wear everything you need.
In addition to apparent things, such as footballs, slips or English staff, it must have a neilon-nick (stylists use it for some items, such as cotton or bottle), special clips for the strengthening of the weapons of the weapons if the clothes are too large (bottles and similar objects are prohibited, since they are throwing clothes) or a set of shirts.
To get some practical experience from the lessons and get some practical experience, we learned to make the correct instructions on the underground tube.
Even in a study, where the pool is cold, there can be damage -- not talking about the streets on the street.
And that's what we're doing.
You don't have to cut a fuckin' knife so that you don't cut them out.
This requires real art.
I was glad that Mary had praised.
I didn't know what I was doing.
It's just a part of what we heard during the second part of the outcome day.
I'm starting to understand that being a professional stylist isn't so easy whatever they say.
V Need for Speed: Refuge occurs in America.
View
What had to be an unforeseen cross-border, it turned into a rutine morning road to a series of inappropriate and irregular errors.
The ambitions were satisfied to a certain degree, but it is not important because no one was obviously wanted to do the rest.
Before exiting the new version of the "Flug" subtitle, there were great hopes.
It was expected to move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; demonstration versions testified that the game would take a valuable place in the Genre of Natal Games.
We were interesting in seeing parts of the game where the main hero gets out of the car and runs.
As it is often from NFS, then, many things are different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty bad arcade trail, but the general impression has caused a few unnecessary errors that are present in this series of games for several years.
And it's actually not a mistake, but a manifestation of an unexplained lean once.
The accommodation starts very well.
You are a part of the story, which the main hero, Jack, decides to solve some similar problems with the involvement in illegal footnote through America.
You're in the west of the car, in San Francisco, and your task is to come to New York first.
This is a number of interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages divided by more than fifty horns.
This means that each trip is walking on its road, from where it goes in a different and interesting environment.
Therefore, there is no feeling that the same thing happens all the time in the game.
Although the graphics are at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, it is pleased to look at some traces.
Yet, the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although caring through the wilderness, it is very pleasant in the lowly mountains to be able to carry a car in the wilderness.
Furthermore, the swimming of time survives a very normal.
For example, in the wilderness, you fall into a sand storm that is significantly decreasing.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful so that they do not fall under the lavine.
There's a lot of good arrangements.
There's just a few different ways, but it's enough.
Sometimes you are trying to go along with a few opponents (usual chain); then you are trying to improve time (default chain with a secondary) or you are with one opposer.
Furthermore, you have a timely impact on the ground, which makes your task more difficult.
Outside car components are new.
It's just an interactive animation where the majority of the time Jack flees from someone and you must help him by pressing the needed buttons at the time.
Nothing complicated.
Although surprisingly, these fragments were much less than you could expect (all three to be precise).
In fact, it is good for the game because it doesn't eat the property; given all the above, it's one of the things that make the game more busy.
Good model and tracks of previous models.
This means that she doesn't mean anything special anymore, but it's not enough.
If you are looking for a real life, you will have to look for another.
However, this model of conduct is very suitable for dynamic trucks, although the market can be found better options.
It's all right until it's fine.
However, there is a time to start problems.
Despite the model of the leadership, the model of the covering is not so good.
You don't expect complex conversions and conversions from this game, but if you don't understand before you met an object, how your car will be, something's wrong.
Usually, by sharing or walking out of the cars in the floor, you sometimes have a low casage of another machine, but sometimes in practically similar situation your car begins to be nicely disturbed.
Or the kids were divided.
This is not so important by means of the restart system, but it is enough to excite pleasure.
Restarts are built so that if you split or go away from the track, the game returns you to the point where it has been interrupted.
However, only five transactions are available for each shock.
If you're using them all, you'll have to start a walk from the beginning.
It's if something doesn't get, but you can't trust it fully.
Sometimes the restarts are not enough, and you need to learn about the nazis of the race.
The important deficiency of the game is that the same things are often happening in the same places.
For example, some turns need to go in a certain way, elsewhere you just don't write.
In other cases, you meet civil cars in a certain way in the same configuration, whether you come first, five, five seconds before or for a minute later.
This particularly disappoints situations when you see your opposite easily moves between two cars moved in the opposite direction, while when you appear there, the cars are already resolved so that you need to move or cut down the speed.
It doesn't matter when you show them near them; everything is so designed that the situation always happens before your nose.
The opposers have other privileges.
During the game, you find a few of them, where, independently, one of the same opposite is going to swallow you on the same way.
This is particularly obviously at the end of the game, on the long pool where you eat in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opposite must stand before you despite anything.
The matter is that when he is before you, he disturbs you from an exam that leads to one or more cases in this section.
You may understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenalina, but this is so clearly that it begins quickly to cause distress.
Sorry, despite the simple model of leading, the game is busy and sometimes so disappointed by events that you don't have time to take attention to what happens around you.
It doesn't matter that you don't give it to be a concept with fifty unique tracks, follow-ups of foolishness or something else.
The idea of the changes of cars during the hook is unusual.
You need to follow the trip, because your car can be changed in them, despite the most of the cases that you already have, it is enough.
Cars are divided in three categories.
Sport vehicles are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are for seasons, and exotic super-sporters for technical management, for example, on the outstretched mountain traces.
The main story mode closely with the challenge mode mode; it's a lot of individual parts that you're learning by the game.
Here you win for your personal business, both medals and points, general for challenges and stories regimes.
Many opportunities are available to get a higher drive level: starting from machines and finishing the profile.
Moreover, the profile with the Autolog online function, which, in addition, compares the results you have made with the results of other players, and provides a relationship with the public.
There is another failure that is difficult to understand; this is an example of the last trial in the course of success.
You and your car are falling into a metro tonnel (we will think so), where you are shooting in the darkness.
Your speed meter shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (we will think so) when you suddenly get a metro road, turning your car into the metal brush.
During a few days, our editor discussed whether we were actually no seconds during the creation of the game, or its creators really viewed us as such a disease.
The technical composer of games is nothing special, but the general impression of the video range is most often pleasant, sometimes even by it.
Although in some critical times, the quality of the record is sometimes quite decreased.
This is particularly the case of events with a large number of participants where the good record would not help you too.
Sounds are all right. Soundtrack is a loversman.
In order to please as far as possible the youth audience can, the "compositions of different styles" have been entered in the soundtree; but they are almost buying a game because of it.
Common impression on Need for Speed: Return quite unseen.
If the game had disappeared clearly unnecessary errors, we could honestly say that the run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the rest of the game will feel incompatible.
Of course, this is a good time, but prepare for the failure to blind you as the airport manufacturer.

Employment in the EU Vicenava:
Czech reputation does not have any desirers and skeptics to them.
"The Treaty of Lisbon called out the meaning of a divergence between the divisions."
"I didn't expect to be such a cruel war."
"There are five or six years before the situation is stabilised, calm, and all players will be used to their new roles," the EU Milena Viceno's missionary began hardly his lesson to the jury.
It is before it, as far as it holds its "Light and openly about" division in the first part of its lesson, where it described the EU institutions from there and between them so simple and understanding that many readers from the Co-school's jury would be determined.
Moreover, Vicena thanked the new permanent Chairman of the Council, Herman Van Rompey:
"Snacked critics said that he was a usual severe office mouse that could not play any role; I should say, they were all surprised how well he did his role."
"He who can listen to the twenty-seven parties at the same time is to communicate with them and has a clear presentation on which side the EU should develop."
She explained her new position to the representative on security and security issues as an answer to the question, "Who is the Union?
Nobody's going to prohibit our weeds
The review continued to focus on the EU's key programme in the past, the present and closer future.
She called the successful Chairman of the Czech Republic in the last year.
The Czech Republic had an exhausted financial crisis; they overcome the crisis and the organs of the Eastern Partnership.
She said that the remission of the Government at that time was a negative manifestation that caused a big damage to the Czech Republic.
Czech representatives in the EU are currently very busy.
As said by the employee, and the presidency, and the following financial crisis, have been caused to continue breathing at present.
Moreover, a new seven-year EU budget must be adopted, which is very uncomfortable, taking into account the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be strict and economical to which areas the preferred will be; what countries will receive more support and what less; all these issues are in the future programme.
The employee for the key lozings that she brought to Brussels: "O, understanding."
"I really don't like decreases, foreign words, and jeargons that no one understands.
As citizens can understand that people are not trying to sell → or round-speaks, bananas of different sizes, or that someone's going to prohibit our species of sugar."
It will also be more effective in the EU environment and in more cheques in the Peace organizations.
Very powerful is our future
The employee claims that cheeks are considered as skeptics, as well as people who are more negative and not the parts of the matter.
She wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be held in the Peese organizations.
It believes that there are several factors: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their disabilities to write motivating letters; at the same time, with small support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Chairmanship of the Czech Republic, she noted the power and cooperation of the Supreme Group.
"People, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a word comes to us, the Frenchman says, "Hey, what is the assembly, the Vice-Group again?" and he doesn't like it.
In the future, the Union of Vicenava is expected in the mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policy of States parties.
In comparison with the new Federation, it considers the idea of two powerful, unless much more powerful.
"We have both countries inside and outside the region."
"We have Shanghen's area, and we have an institution of strengthened cooperation."
"The first statement was said that countries who want to be united, while those who do not want to stay on the side."
"The number of such agencies will grow; it will actually be two realities," expects Vicenava.
In this regard, it highlighted the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompey in the implementation of the rules, which should be discussed by all part countries and not only in the area.
Board history:
The IBM newspaper enters its second century.
If someone wants to find a word that is best expressed by IMB, the closest probably will be "long-term".
For the large public, IBM is a symbol of technology revolution; the company is considered very modern, although she was more than 100 years ago.
The company's duty was charged by her first boss, the master of Thomas J. Watson's older.
He believed in his nephew, in which many world problems could be easily resolved if people would think.
His "D" lounge!" is thus a stam around which the life of the future gigant (as well as the name of its internal magazine, which IMB began to be issued in 1935).
Moreover, this was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson was carefully exhibited.
"For us in the IBM, long-term thinking means constant movement for the future.
IBM survived and flowed hundred years because she remained faithful to her original values, even though she was not afraid to change all around herself.
In our first hundred years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to reach even more," says the current companion's runner of Sjuel J. Palmisano on the occasion of Jubilee.
Complicated system
In the 1930s, Watson was concerned about the workers like the Father in the Czech Republic - IMB was one of the first American employees with payable relief, robotic insurance, elegant uniform and complex bonus system for the best winners and undertakers.
In the same way, I have long-term IBMs with consumers.
Since the beginning, the company had found a brilliant application for talentable people, which was one of the first world companies that had eliminated all the discrimination, which was a great choice before it.
It is in accordance with the anti-discrimination and the current plan with which a woman, Virginia Rommetti, changes Palmisano in the year ' s.
She worked in the IBM for thirty years; she is currently the sales, marketing and development director.
In recent years, the IBM has organized meetings, online brain stumblings, which have been held in many future innovations.
It's not surprised that a lot of ideas work about half a million people in the company.
Organization with good reputation
The strong position of the company in the bus is guaranteed by a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, the concept of IBM was more organized than a technology company," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of the IBM Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it is a company that helps solve business problems with technologies," adds Jodge Colony from the Forrester Research Consulting Company.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between getting out of the market and creating it.
In a hundred years of IBM, or the "Golbay Giant", as it is called in the United States because of his logop, he became one of the largest world companies.
It seems to be the most universal technology company that develops equipment and software; infrastructure; hosting and consular services -- from servers to nanotechnology.
It has the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of them have received the Nobel Price.
Its acquisitions include, for example, bankomate, bank card, financial supper, strike code and diskette.
With 220 billion dollars, based on the market capitalisation, IBM became the second of the technological company (the first place of Apple) in this year, and Microsoft was the first time since 1996.
Look forward
Not all of her products came to buyers and entered in the period. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operational system; Prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by the movement forward, you can't be emotionally linked to the past," says C.J. Palmisano.
That is why the IBM is easily based on a few - if they do not work, it refuses.
This is different, for example, from its Microsoft competitor, which is based and anxious to fall on Windows, its operational system.
Persian technology
The basic income of the IBM is obtained from services, and about one five in each case comes from computer programmes and equipment.
As in 1990, with two lower capital, she was the best equipment manufacturer company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold a lower amount of $15 billion and has included $58 billion in the purchase of per-technology.
It continued investment even after 2008, when the current economic crisis was first struck in the world.
IBM follows the example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments in the years of the Great Depression.
Until, IBM has not caused the current crisis.
Since 2008, IBM's price has grown up to 120 per cent recored; pure for the company's constant growth.
Corporative IBM nine is to change everything except its own prices.
It is therefore expected that even if another crisis occurs, this enormous giant will face the situation.
IBM story: from the grid knife to the space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was a hundred years ago in New York, and its original name "Calculation, Tabulation, recording" was sufficiently complex.
It took the name of IBM in 1924, which was originally called the bridge that was spent for the company in Canada and South America.
The funds of the future IBM were based on four companies starting in the 1880s.
They possessed technologies such as the annual "times" for you, i.e. hours for the time when they come and go out of work.
The architect of the new company was a businessman of Ranlet Flint, who also addressed the company's winners advice before 1930.
Flint took a competitive company director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
Then the IBM founder was a shadow - Watson's ideas remained based on the insufficient corporate culture and individuality.
Watson was invoked by the company until 1952.
The IBM, clearly from the name, began from the production and sale of different business equipment - from the grid knife and the meat to the cash equipment.
In the first four years, Watson's leadership was doubled up to nine million dollars, and the company's large expansion was started at all continents.
Watson's so important for the company that his place in the chair of the director took his son, Thomas Watson's younger.
Under its leadership, the IBM began developing research technologies and created the first programming language.
In 1960, as well as IBM computers helped NASA to control space flights - to Mercurie, Saturn, and in 1969 - a human flight on Monday.
However, in 1964, IBM divorced the first family of computers - IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of that time, named IBM 5150, was on the market in 1981.
After twenty years, the IBM sold the production of Chinese computers by Lenovo, at the same time buying the Consultation PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus completely addressed on consult and services with high added value.
In the last three years, IBM has been successful with its concept of Smarter Planet.
It aims to use technologies in areas where it is not planned yet, and to improve the road situation and urban management.
The IBM has recently set up the Smarter Commerce form, which helps businessmen to control the whole trade.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czech Slovakia, the IBM was based in 1932 as the first country at the same time in the central and east.
Today, the IBM CZ also manages the Portuguese Autosing Centre in Brno.
The staff of the Central and Eastern Apartment is located in Prague, where the world-level group also works for research.
The record of his wrong-doing husband:
Iveta, leave yourself stupid, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtaržov (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Richtarge (53) was a bodyguarder and lover of Bartosh (45), Darina still hoped that he would come and return home.
However, she doesn't want to wait anymore, and she set out clear rules for her future life.
"Papa can come home, but no longer as my partner," Richard explained.
When Darina Richtarge was a summer before in her home, she probably had no smaller idea of what happened to her marriage.
And although she was for Ivet to leave Richian 30 days later, Pepa didn't leave the song.
Moreover, he was publicly acknowledged that he loved her.
During a certain time, Darina was deceived by making a look that she had humbled her husband, and now she was forgiving him.
I'm driving with who his wife's sleeping.
Even if Richtarg and Bartosh will ever get away, his wife will not accept him with the spread volumes.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to carry out his last days in our house, no one's going to go out."
"Now he will finish his days, not as my favorite, lost and found old stupid, but the person with whom I am connected," said Richtaržow, adding that she has already been released from her husband and is just insisting on both occasions.
Until Joseph had nothing to do with his wife.
"I consider my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife decided to leave a marriage on a boy, and I respect this decision."
"Our union still works; I'm responsible for repair, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate totally normally, but we don't share the bed anymore," said the Rehtarge of Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richtarz's love is new, he won't stop her.
"We don't dream together, and I don't care where she goes with who she has a friend.
I know that it's my fault, I've been in love with Ivet, and I have full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst women's habits: Do they touch you?
When you ask men to call some typical bad women's habits, they usually count them all.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in lines that describe a few women's habits that make men hurt?
Shopping
Your second half regrets that you're keeping on the stores?
Do you have to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like to buy big sales?
If so, your shopping can be a stupid custom.
Women recognize that they need to control their ability to shopping.
Yet, who of you will refuse to walk through the garments of clothes in the search for perfectly sitting clothes and the example of it (in different color options) in examples?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it can be a real hole.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait outside...
Eternal Deficiency
"I'm too hot?"
"I need to cut down at least five pounds -- maybe I'm starting to make a gimnasty?"
"You're still with me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you come into a group of women interrupted in your outer form.
Not so that you should stop watching yourself, but many men have literally an allergic to constant complaints of partners for their outer appearance.
The strong field is also aware of the most of these complaints, the more women disappoint them.
The most important order and cleanness
It's like an infinite story.
Mocky glass, swimming, screening, shipping, cleaning the badge, at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner because he's set on a clean café in the crazy bottles; kids in a clean cancer and fingerprints on a glass in the hotel that was so difficult to clean?
If you suffer from this "rejection", try to realize that it's not good for you, and that your family doesn't have the order and cleanness to stand on the first place.
Anxiety to cleanness can threaten your own and the whole family.
Employment to command
"Bring the white into the Wastebasket."
"You're going to get the crazy notes tomorrow?"
"Don't be on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may consider that it is very disappointable.
Of course, you have good things, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understand that, women wouldn't have to order them so often...
Advanced
Some women like to stumble, strike, and strike intrigues against others.
Women are focused on their initiatives, so they like to discuss who, who, who and why.
From time to time, it's probably every one of us're getting out of the ships.
We'll be manifest, like this, the nature of all women.
Whatever happens, there are more serious branches, women who are often disturbing and disturbing the rest, particularly in the female slave collective, representing a big danger for their environment.
Resultative transfers of Jagra and Woracheca helped Philadelphia to win
During the NHL catch on Monday, two resulting transfers of the Jeromy Jagra attacked helped Philadelphia to win 5:3 on Caroline's ice, and he was again the most resulting Czech catch player.
In both cases, Claude Giro experienced 30-year-old stars; added another transfer and was announced by the best catch player.
Two outcome transfers were also belonging to the player in one team with Yagrem Jacob Worachek.
After the catch of Yagr, he told foreign journalists that he had predicted Gira a great night.
"I told him to the cat that he'd kill it-trick."
"I felt that."
"You sometimes feel such things," Jagger explained, after which the Giro had lost the naked at the first opportunity that Flayers gave.
Later, the second goal of the team also had a "Cheesian track".
The loud Harricenz Borachek has overcome the shabby and has transferred it to Talboth, who killed between the circles.
In a second before the first interruption of the home player Patrick Dwayer decreased the breakdown in a number of benefits, but at the beginning of the second and again, Flyers were brought.
Especially Giru.
After the resulting date of Jagra, he killed the third cold, and further his hit was converted into the fourth of Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player of the ligue, but he's exactly entering the three best," Jagger said, praising his central.
"I never believe that at the end of my career I'll play with a hocked player like him."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in the NHL, my companions at the team tried to help me, and now my order has come," added Jagr.
Caroline made the much more dramatic with Tomo Ruth and Duier's penalties, reducing the breakdown to one neck.
Further difficulties prevented the Mee_Rid, which increased the breakdown to two points.
"Ponger's nice in our area."
"He hit the shibe, I went away, and Rid went to the long end."
"I was stuck in him and glad that it was with," he described his impression from the last naked catch.
Victory moved Philadelphia to the first place at the East Conference.
The Protector of the Monreal team of Jaroslav Spachek did not finish the catch with Buffalo; he left the game during the second period due to the trauma of the part of the body.
However, with the experienced protector of Canadians, they lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after the penalty series.
Tomash the Plekanian couldn't be killed during one of their attacks.
More than lost eyes, the household trainer was worried by a large number of trauma in the back, since the catch ended with five protectors.
"The bad situation."
"We ended the catch with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"Whatever, we can't do anything about it, we just need to be humble with it," Jacques Martin said.
"Replace for replacement, it was incredible and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move a shadow from our area."
"What was our side," added Protector P.K.Subban
After the thirty attacks of the Czech Republic of Onjay Paulo helped Vinnipegz to win Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Challenge Jets, who stopped the fifth series of disorders, were killed by five different players.
Travel price dynamic since 1989
By 1989 only five State tourist agencies could work in former Czech Slovakia: Chedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since traveling to the West was cruel, the tourists at that time were mainly sold tourists to the country of a block socialist.
Thus, the Czech tourists moved to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crym on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (two countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balton).
The only exception was between 1962 and 1972 when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslavia regime returned to the West, which had the meaning of the traveling of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The big paradox of the period was that the citizens of the block socialists (i.e. Czech Slovakia) were not allowed to travel individuals in socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovakia citizen wanted to move himself, such as the Soviet Union or the Poland, it was necessary to make a letter invitation from this country; otherwise, the individual trip was unfair.
At that time, tourist agencies traveled to the West, but they had to stand all night, with a laughing, or having "good friends" in the Agency.
And that wasn't all yet.
It was necessary for the west movement and it was not issued to political unbelievable people who had not been allowed to travel.
The Czech Slovak currency was not freely converted; without a currency allowance, it was not allowed to obtain the money (west currency) for the road to the West.
Most of the Czechs conducted their home releases, which led to a large number of cottages and summer houses, this custom is maintained for this day.
After 1989, the tourism in Czech Republic has thus survived the current revolution.
During the period 1989, the ADR or Bulgaria was a collection of our travels, the Czech reported 4.5 million travellers throughout the world in the past year.
The big paradox that we do not know anymore is that we could not be free to visit the most popular people of Croatia until 1989, since it was part of former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need for visa to the Neighbourhood of the West was canceled, which was the beginning of a large wave of short traveling mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czech Slovaks couldn't get to the west travelers, all wanted to go there at least for a minute.
For example, in Paris, the Czech tourists slept in parks in palaces, since their income at that time was not enough for a hotel or a pension.
The typical characteristic of the Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring their own food (conserves, sales, etc.) to calculate money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a freely converted Czech crown, and after decades, our tourists can purchase the west currency.
Our livelihood and average income increased that led to another important situation about 1997.
Since 1997, the growing question has allowed tourist agencies to prepare a series of transmissions carried out by a cartridge, compared to the past, the airports now have become incrediblely disturbing by the possibility of ordering optical swimming.
At the end of the 1990s, Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all developed world countries, except the United States, which made our travels more.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution occurred in 2000, which led to historically the first straight road from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
From that pool, cheese tourists in heavy exotic countries will be moved into 12 exotic directions by the winterfly from the Czech Republic.
Currently, about 100,000 cheques visit exotic countries each year!
Another important event of this period, which symbolizes our development after the revolution, occurred in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States dismissed the need for visits for the Czech tourists, so our country was always accompanied by the most developed world countries.
The first in the history, in 2008, the Czech half of their releases passed outside the border (50.3 per cent); and the first in the history, they spent more than 15,000 crowns per person in the time of destruction, including the costs of the destination.
The common assembly must choose the president, the threat of the pata is returned
There was no President in the Czech Football for about five months, and there is a risk that Ivan Gashak, Chapter of the Czech Football Association (FACHR) will not be called even after another extraordinary general meeting in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement with the rules of election to follow.
Without that, the vote for one of the three candidates will not begin.
The Yindrich Richle, Miroslav Pelt and Tomash Paclic want to raise the Czech football.
Gashack went out of his station in June, and he invited his colleagues to join and find a person that would have a football in the future.
Nevertheless, the Year of Gashaka reloaded the football in a division between two association palats that could not choose one candidate.
This was clearly on 16 September when the new president had to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly had soon come to the National House in Prague, Laughs, since negotiations remained locked, not only by the election procedure.
There was no consensus on the conduct of a person who had the right to vote at the general meeting - only legal representatives or officers who had been granted authority.
This moment was partially resolved by the Recommendation of the Institute of State and Right, which is not a representative of the powers provided.
The election rules are, however, continued.
The Executive Board also has not helped too much, although it is mainly addressed to this issue at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary meetings.
The vote has changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: how to go to the third round and go away from the path?
"The dispute is whether to follow the rules established or to find another model," says one of the vice-Presidents of FACHR Dushan Freedom, representing a professional football in the Association Management.
Based on the model provided by the Constitution, the winner of the 3th round is a candidate who has received great support for the hall from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is a compromise, as it is said, to be considered as a winner of the candidate's choices with a maximum number of general votes in both palaces.
The Czech Party insists that at least two thirds of the votes should be voted in total.
"Therefore, two previous rounds would lose their meaning; it would completely reject the concept of two palats," the Freedom is with the evidence of Morabia, which says that it would be better not to change the rules and to vote in terms of standards.
A few of the unexpectedly agreed Tomash Paclic with its opinion, although, according to the rules of election set by the statute, the Pelt is more than other candidates.
"I would like the choices to pass the maximum by the statute."
"I want to escape all the representative stupidity as at the previous general meeting," says the owner of Victoria P'en, who is the first candidate, and in his statements he mainly opposed Pelte.
Pilta remains optimist.
He believes that the new president will be held in Nimburg; he also hopes that the candidates will cooperate in the future.
"All emotional disturbance will be quiet after today's expected outcome of the national collection in Championat."
"Futball will be again on a happy wall, people will cooperate more about," says the representative of Jablone, which has most experiences in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rayhl's more arrested.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very unlikely."
"This is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but is an attempt to adjust the rules."
"It may cause another break of the general meeting."
"I hope a healthy sense will win," Rachel said.
There was not so much time to reach agreements.
According to some information, the negotiations have passed directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be before the morning.
The additional road, which, besides others, had to be delivered by the Vice-Presidents of Dalbor Kuchera and Richla to Subburn, did not fly from Prague tomorrow because of technical failure; they wanted an alternative to deliver part of the Executive Committee to the executive catch.
Finally, the meeting at the level of the Minister, expected in the middle of, may become a decision.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Affairs, Joseph Dobesh, would like that the opposers in the form of the strongest association in the country should come to an agreement.
There are many: Government subsidies; football credit; and the planned general assembly of CSTV with the new Czech Direction after the Sazki financial problems.
Paclic is in the presidential fight because he does not see the appropriate candidate
If the Chapter of Footballs of Tomash Paclic had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting that would comply with all its requests to the Chairman of the Czech Republic of the Czech Republic (FACHR), he would not even refer to a high post.
"If I had been a worth candidate, I would have handled him and I would not be involved in fighting myself."
"But this man hasn't been found until," said the Paclic TCK.
Paclic's motive to intervene against Miroslav Pelto and the Hindrich Richle - trying to prevent Pelte, the preferential election favorite, from the FACHR.
Moreover, Paclic emphasises that, in the case of victory, he will remain president only until 2013 when a regular general assembly is planned.
In the future, he would like that post to take an experienced top manager, not too much with football life.
"I've talked to a few people that could mean."
"I was terrible to hear some of them said that they wouldn't even want to have regard to the Czech football at this time."
"I would like to change this opinion," he said.
The main distortion of Paclic with Pelta is currently with the relations of the last with Roman Berbro, the president of the Regional Football Association in Plzena.
Thus, the packle is not acceptable to be the President of Pelta.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and the football will not move forward."
"with the support of Berbra, a powerful businessman, it would be even more deteriorated for the football," Paclic said.
He refers to the fact that the name of Pelta was recorded a few years ago while listening to the phones in the investigation of corruption; Pelte was able to avoid the sentence.
"I don't know what the victory of Pelta would bring to the football."
"And how we would look in the eyes of the EUFA and the FIFA," Paclic said, "and now he does not mention his previous statement that he will "sell the P club if Pelta is the President."
If Paclic wins Thursday, he could continue to cooperate with Pelta in the future.
This opinion is divided by another candidate, Ryan, whom Paclic supported before the general assembly in September that ended fiasco.
"He would be the first to whom I would turn."
"He's very powerful."
"I can keep it in the head of the collection."
"But he can't handle association."
"I don't also have my nose in what I don't understand," said Paclic, which brought great attention to himself in September when he supported the removal of the judge's brigade devoted by Ludec Macelo, who changed Dagmar Damkov.
The paclic claims that he will risk the management of the association.
He is on his experience of the management of private companies; since the past year, he has managed the P'yean team, who has delivered his first triumph in the liga in May.
"I have the power to make the football environment changes, to support its changes to the best."
"Restricting the impact of some groups of persons who are inclinated to affect the disciplinary and apologizing Council that leads to deteriorating situations," Paclic said, "he does not hide his antipathia, for example, to the Director of Sparta Daniel Crjettinski.
One of its priorities will strengthen relations between the FACHR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it will contribute to a higher political level to increase the amount of money for sports from lottery collections.
"This is one of the key moments that the new president must take place."
"If taxes are charged by azart games as the political party approves, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly declare where the money will go," he said.
Paclic does not consider his relationship with the P-Club to be burden, although he claims that President FACHR should be independent.
Pilta is with the Jablonic, and Rail with the Prague Duckle.
"It's not a perfect option."
"And I don't see the meaning of my hypocritical transmission of the P club's actions to someone else, when I'm going to go back there after six months," Paclic says.
Pelta has promised new rules of FACHR that will allow the electoral Path to escape
In two days before the General Football Association Assembly, one of the candidates in the president, Miroslav Pelt, promised that if he was chosen, he would follow the new rules of the FACHR to escape the election rules in the future.
Before negotiations on Thursday in Nimburk, Jablonez's officer remains optimist and believes that the attention of the pre-elective fight will feel aware of the current success of our football collection.
Before the missing elections in September, Pelta promised that if he wins, he is focused on both the representation and the receipt of financial funds.
He decided to participate in elections at the last time before the last general meeting, which could have been a two-month delay for him to maintain his ideas of football in a wider context.
"The people at all levels have been in the football for a long time, and they expect the president to be held on Thursday."
"They feel that it is now the same time for someone to take an association," a person, mainly with the jabble club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the Executive Association Committee.
This gives him the ability to assume that he is sufficiently experienced to manage the Czech football.
He believes that the current issues are caused by the Iforia, who ruled during Ivan Gashek's rulership.
"Therefore, rules that were not so consistent as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If the different ways of representation were not adopted, we would have been president from September," said Pelta.
It was referring to the rename of the key document of the civil Association as a false objective for the delegates.
"If I become the president, I will consider it my personal task, and I will take myself a similar responsibility if this attempt is a failure."
"This is the fundamental question we can't do without," said Pelt.
Furthermore, he says that he doesn't try to put himself on the background of the opponents.
In the past, he has already stated that he can have his collaboration with Hindrich Richle, whom he appreciates for the education of the jury; he is fully aware of the fact that his opposite candidate should be his first vice-president.
For a long time, he had not attacked Thomas Paclic, who continued criticizing Pelta.
"He's in the football more than a year and has been successful."
"Whatever, his attacks were inappropriate, and many people were surprised by the methods of his election campaign."
"And therefore, some of them now doubt his true identity," said Pelta about his competitor, saying that he is faithful to the declarations that he declared in September.
It considers its main weapons of football knowledge from the lowest level to the national collection.
The national collection must represent the whole football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents starting with the case of persons or the consequences of the past year's corruption scandal."
"In addition, I would focus on negotiations both with private and public sectors to guarantee sufficient amount of money for all the football," said the 40-year candidate TKK two months ago.
Then he promised that his choice at the post of the football head would not be free of the staff.
"I'll need to know the offices and offices of the Departments." It was his letter to Strahwa, where the intergovernmental period causes comprehensive nervousness.
Despite the current disastrous scenarios, which consist of the planned general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not come to Nimburg on Thursday.
"If the only question is how to make choices in the third round, we can handle it."
"Futball needs confidence that he can get, only from the end of his leader," says Pelt, who remains optimist within two days until the key day of his officer's career.
Ryan promises that the FACHR will start working actively
If at the meeting on Thursday, the Vice-President of Yindrich Richle will become President of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association will be insufficient.
Ryan promises that if they choose him, it's time for hard work.
He wants to make changes in the system and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for the area of football.
He also promises to solve the problem of the students; to improve both EUFA and FIFA; to make more money in football; and to continue with the previous president, Ivan Gashak.
"As the president, I would like to focus on the football at all."
"From contacts with EUFA and FIFA, to national collection, professional football and football activities for youths."
"I don't want to say that I'm going to do everything myself," Rachel said in his interview for the TCK.
"I am a commander, and I want to deal with the powers of the Executive Committee so that each member of the focus is in a specific field."
"I'll deal closely with the tasks so that the football will make great steps forward in each of these sections."
"It is probably not like many people, because it will mean a hard thing, not just a criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of the criticism in the football motion is expected to be doubted in its candidate.
"Or I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know whether there is any meaning in this, and that I will not be surrounded by those who put my wheels in my wheels and put me in doubt every step," he explained his doubts.
"Now, many people told me that I shouldn't think, other people will come."
"This is the trust I can't reject," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue what he started with Gashake.
"The larger number of jobs have been made for the two years, and I don't want to remark all of this."
"The processes that could result within a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if a other candidate, Miroslav Pelt, would be chosen, the situation in the Association could return to what was before Gashak.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's what Mirek Pelt's powerful."
"He is surrounded by people who would work football so that it was only available for the chosen."
"I can be accused of a lot, but it is not in sub-activity."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone will take a good time, not just a chosen minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he rejects the accusation that he is only the President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people are trying to confess the contrary, I'm planning to make a ma'm for Moravia."
"For example, it was time to deal with the second liga in the Czech and Moral parts that winners would continue to fight in the first liga."
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three moral teams in the ship, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Richle.
While the Governing Body of Tomash Paclic has entered the Presidency's fight, Ryan does not be urged to appreciate his chances of victory.
"Now, I still feel supported in the Czech City, which has chosen me as a vice-president, and I see that I have achieved some evident successes," said Ryan. He will make the economy of tens of millions of crowns on unnecessary contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on the lottery law.
On the other hand, he is partly guilty of the unity in the association.
Acknowledging that Pelta was "excluding from the process of returning the credit of the Czech football", he considers another opponent, Paclic, a strong candidate who has what to offer.
"No one can doubt that he was greatly in Plzena this year."
"If they choose him, I hope that he will continue what Ivan Gashak started without the ambiguous changes in the committees."
"He would not repeat facts for his benefit," Rachel said about his opposite.
The most beautiful bases are
Eat in water
Julia Stanek
Children's bases with universal vololine optics and statutory bases in Budapest, and travellers can test incredible waters and enhance the body in jacuza after the town or transition.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing Iris Meder could not take place during its studies of poess in the last half of the year: without its purchasing costume.
She was on the back of the water, she looked up on the top of the cocktails, flew to the marmorous cherubs waiting for it at the end of the base, and loved the deeply restored floods in the style of ar-nuvo.
She was then going to add each favorite basen to its block - with important details about the building and history of the opinion.
The story of the Mediterranean review of more than 200 floating basens - and now he has collected impressions in its recent book of Badefreuden (Rading of Buying), where everything came from public basens in München to historical purchases in the Black Forest and "Functional Betons" in Townus.
Her "traveling to the most inhabitants of the Central Company" has been conducted through 13 countries, other than Germany, Austria and Switzerland, where she has visited a bathroom in Italy, France, the Czech Republic of, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and in one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is the real enthusiasm of the cumulative culture.
It's a very little enthusiasm for the attitude, says Meder, but it's different in the water.
The only deficiency is that flood worshippers should be covered with the blue coffee and chlore couch, while the fleepers can breathe with a flashing breath of the woods or listen to the joyful birds in the park.
"I asked myself at the same time why you flourish -- the bases must always be such a terrible," says Vienna Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful basens."
When the surface breaks the ®ettucle
The flashing in the basin and searched oil in the sauna is so significant, as Meder seems to be stimulated by all feelings.
And you flourish, the bases may be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take such work. "You have the surface of water in the base."
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of all opinions."
Everything is visiblely reflected: high pools, coloured bottles and tramplines.
The 190 pages of the "Please Buying" illustrated contain a valuable information on the textural and cultural history of health oasis - and you want to get into water.
The Water Collector Meder found several expenditures during the investigation in Hungary.
She discovered a rich nitrate of water in a cup of cotton (Mischkolz-Tappolce) and a terminal bathroom filled with cool water, as well as a flash bottle (Városi Termal birdö in Jasýn), as well as a great terapeutical bathroom, such as 100-year-old Sechenny bullets in Budapest.
Of many open bases in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, it is opened by a species. You can see the whole Zurich from the bubble on the cup or consider the low Arlberg from the open base in Sankt Anton, and there is a window that allows you to see what happens on the hall.
Perhaps the most common design is expecting buyers in Langenfeld, which looks like NLOs, just the landing in Alpha.
The winter rises from it a couple of three open cancers, which seems to be very small at the Ectal Mountains' background.
Algambra in Svartwalde
Meder's basin collector did not meet in each base of clorry.
Many purchases are cutting up with gris, and the bubal names of Arpad in Bequestab are so breathing out of oil that you may be difficult to believe that you are in a healthy source.
The water is nearly black of the ice, which draws to the skin as soon as you threaten in the bassine is an awesome experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at a certain time in seeking beautiful for purchasing, and when she tried to visit the open cheese bathroom in the Lugaczovice, she discovered that the territory was printed.
The purchases designed by Dushan Jurkovic's Identifier were closed in 1902.
When Meder looked in the views of a red-white-year-ground window in the style of ar-nuvo, she saw the coffee pillars between the coffee pillars.
One of the places where the disruption was stopped by warm tracks, a wonderful floating bassine in Swarzwald, the Term Water Garden in Bad Wildbad.
The bases have already passed through three stages of building. You will not only find the non-Roman elements of the period after the construction in 1844 but also the Mauritanian Hall in the style of Algabra, approximately 1900.
After the deep river in 1995, the Termal Garden is a favorite floating basein of Iris Meder's basin and not only because it is a generation from Svartwald.
"This is a real achievement, so the mastery is to compute such different textural styles," Meder says.
To go to a terminal basement in such a holiday, it is evidently a second-step busy.
Speculation of agricultural production
Dotche Bank investigates trade in agricultural production.
Christian Tivs
Will Doyce Bank stop trading agricultural production?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkermann for a slave group to investigate the consequences of speculation for minors worldwide.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg
The situation is clear for German citizens, and, according to one study, 84 per cent of Germans believe that the banks are not acceptable for agricultural production, such as grain and sugar.
Two thirds of the requested require Doyche Bank and other banks to stop trade in agricultural production, since trade is a deterioration of the problems standing before the poorest people worldwide.
The conclusions were made in the study conducted by the Institute of Research and the Forsa analysis statistics from the Foodwatch consumer organisation.
The study is based on the Foodwatch report in the middle of October.
The report writer, Harald Schuman, demonstrates that the game of taxes on global goods bears increases prices - and that the banks are so involved in world hunger.
The consumer interest protectors company directly addressed the Doyce Bank Joseph Ackerman, although major banking houses such as Godman Sax and Morgan Stanley trade the same.
The taxes on the goods were particularly considered as a means to protect the marketers from the price covering.
Whatever happens, most experts are now that players have denied the rules of proposals and questions and are denied by the poorest.
In contrast with the competitors in the United States, Akkerman answered the criticism, promised to investigate the accusations and said that no trade was worth to risk the good repute of Doyce Bank.
In SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international slave group is currently investigating the accusations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed at the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of Doyce Bank, with recommendations on the matter.
The Chapter of the Bank then plans to announce changes followed by the investigation at the end of January.
The trade of goods may be reduced or completely stopped.
Ackerman works on his image.
Chairman Foodwatch Tilo Bode enjoyed the news, highlighting its criticism towards the financial sector. "The rates for the product prices are an illustration of how the banks are currently countless of common interests."
As the main bank lobbyist, Akkerman has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
"The lady of Bank must remove from the portfolio all investments that make daily taxes for the sales prices," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, and is it about hungry people or Doyce Bank's reputation?"
Ackermanna's quick reaction to sleep, but the director would like to have an impression in a few months before his stay in the office.
On Monday, Dotche Bank announced that the president would not enter into the monitoring Council as planned.
The cancellation of the emergency dispute on the product market could improve its image.
He also needs to be almost forgotten the expenditure, and the consequences are to have the case of his deputy.
Each second would refuse investment in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 online operators have attended the organization's campaign today.
Bode reviewed on Tuesday, a study was conducted for the Institute of Research and Analysis of Forsa on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
Not more than 11 per cent believe that investments that make the price of the sales are acceptable for Doyce Bank.
Many bank clients would also take specific steps if they found that their banks were in such a trade, and each second would reject the contributions that finally lead to the speculation of goods.
43 per cent would be recommended to leave the bank, 49 per cent said that the conclusion of the account and transition to another bank.
House of 21th century in Vienna
Pavilion on a New Section
Ingeborg Vinsovski
The architectural history of the aircraft, falls and a happy end. The Pavilion of Austria for the World Exhibition of 1958 in Brussels was acquired of prize, museum in Vienna, desolated and was banned.
Now it is opened again as an exhibition center.
The Pavilon of Austria, designed by Carl Schwanzer for the World Exhibition of 1958 in Brussels, is an example of modern follow-up and its simple forms, steel Halls, who expressed faith in technical progress.
Pavilon Svanzer won Gran-Pri for the 1958 Yeatuer for his ornament of stain and glass.
It is considered to be a fair in the modern Property.
This has made the Identifier so implied that he has also built Austria ' s pavilion on the World Exhibition.
Finally, he celebrated all the world in 1973 his four-cylinder BMW and her sister in the form of cotton.
Pavilon, who was transferred to the Swiss garden around the South of Vena, was transformed and open as Museum of 20th century in 1962, and is often mentioned as the "Home of the 20th century" for this reason.
Anyway, the Museum on Technical and Space Factions was not suitable - there was no walls that could be covered by experience and bad air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern experience in Vienna had received a new home.
The house was desolate since 2001, and it became worse and worse.
Architecturer Adolph Crishanitz at present is a pavilion, called "The 21th century House" and will be used as a modern experience museum.
This museum is the Belveder Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening, in all senses a joyful event.
Agnes Husslain-Arco, who became a new director of the Austrian Gallery Belveder in 2007, contributed to the new beginning.
Huslain-Arco, a student of the history of experiences with a brilliant youth figure in Sothebys, the Guggenha Museum, and finally became a founder and director of the Museum of modernity in Zalzburg, convinced the politicians and keepers to continue the river, attracted public resources and private resources and decided how it would be used.
The new museum had to include a continuous exhibition of the Freez Watruba Foundation, coffee and booking magazine in accordance with modern experiences, and was also to be built in office.
Strengthening & budgetary control
Crishanitz was then an ideal candidate for the implementation of the project.
He was, likely, being restored and extended by the Venice Session of Joseph Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also learned at the Swanzer at the Venice University of Technology, and the pavilion was a "extremly important place" for him where he visited the exhibitions "almost every week".
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that were before it, with the one that had already lost part of its easierness and easilyness when it was transferred to Vienna and converted.
The problems that occurred in the last restructuring were much more serious, and there was "the energy increased", says Crishanitz.
Eye profiles on the steel phase were replaced, a strengthened steel glass was inserted, and the glass box was replaced by a highly secure glass.
Hundreds of the translation of the warm pool were strengthened or replaced, and the asbest was removed from the decades.
Two lower stages have created a space for new use of the comments, which is a flame of the light bowl between the street and the street to ensure that it is practically new, but still a swimming pavilion of Swanzer.
The origin of the outer doors were stored and from the old red-corn colour of protection against the corrosion.
The movie Hall was the same as it was before.
This is all in the strict control of the museum and with the budget.
"We often had to find material that was a good, deep, and would be approved by the musical administration," said the Crishanite, indicating the inequality in the coast.
It remained cruel and strict, despite the employment, problems and conversions.
Crishanitz recently noted that the pavilion "from Brussels" was a groom - a typical story of "capli in the city".
Such "not always on its own" texture, however, wants to "impulse true knowledge".
The house of the 21th century is in a very proper position, since in the planning of the city a unexpected success has occurred.
The 21th century's house may be filled with the second of the Crishanitz, the French Collectionary of Gabsburg, has received the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and, as reported, has been negotiated with the city on its neighborhood in the Switzerland Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multimillion winter anticrisis package
Deutsche Bahn had a anticrisis plan to escape the winter feedback.
The number of them must increase both.
The costs are millions.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spending more than 70 million in this year to avoid winter discharges and delays.
By focusing on the Deutsche Bahn internal anticrisis plan, the newspaper Billd reports that investments were planned by about 300 million by 2015.
Investment is intended to increase the locomotives and the network's railway even under extreme conditions.
The number of own and in the case of the snows in the shape of roads and forms will be increased to 16,000.
The aim is to clean shapes from snow and ice to work, and 90 per cent of arrows for four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, Chapter Deutsche Bahn, warned about the possibility of cancelling and subsequent transportation of this winter at meeting with Government and industry runners two months ago.
The last winter of Deutsche Bahn has experienced the meaning of difficulties with passenger transports because she has not enough reserves at the time of the deterioration of the deficiencies.
Many new regional trains have been expected to approve the Federal Railway of the Service.
There were also some delays with ICE carriers.
Deutsche Bahn has also been very frequently checking the ICE train axes for many years after one of the ICE trains was broken here on the main box in Kelne.
Uncle Bank will pay a lot of million pounds of trap in the United States.
The new disasters followed the anxieties around Joseph Akkerman, Director-General Doyce Bank: Dotche Banco is in the United States in a lot of millions of pounds of sterling.
According to Doyce Bank, there was a little problem in the family, the past industrial gigant in the United States now has been dismissed. Doyche Bank with the quarter staff in France will pay 145 million dollars (106 million) to relax the disputes arising after bankruptcy during the financial crisis of five largest credit unions.
The problem arose around the sale of hypotetic obligations.
The National Credit Union Management (CUA), the financial market regulator, charges a number of major banks that they have spent false promises to make credit unions lying to buy their financial products.
The value of the obligations was quickly decreased during the financial crisis and decreased the credit unions.
"We are pleased that we have solved this problem without trading the parties to the court," said the representative of Doyce Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not recognize his responsibility.
The same is true for Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the operational reaction of both banks.
National credit union management (CUA) is responsible for the United States credit unions and is involved in banking processes to protect consumers ' contributions.
The NCUA fights for the compensation of deficiencies from the billion.
It's the first agreement of this kind.
The regulator also focused on other largest banks and raised a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in summer.
Doutes of hypothetical obligations are the so-called price papers guaranteed by potential credits.
They are supported by the internal sides.
This determined a number of financial companies when the market in the United States was thrown in 2007.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered to live a long time in September 2008 on the grave of financial crisis.
A few years later, the banks in the United States still fight with storm.
Investors and regulators have issued a large number of claims to pay compensations or to punish guests.
The Federal Agency for the Construction of Life Building (FHFA) has the most important claims.
It accuses 18 largest banks that they have been obtained in the United States credit organisations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's record agreements of about $200 billion.
Doyche Bank also has been threatened by the FHFA for a number of agreements on the total value of 14.2 billion dollars concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that the bank with a quarter bank in Frankfurt takes responsibility for the " losses" but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
Uncle Bank rejected the claims as unbased and reported that it was able to dispute them.
Warren Baffet contributes 10 billion to the IBM
The IBM IT company is actively invested by the Buffet Guarantee.
Since March he purchased shares for over 10 billion dollars.
The largest American investor Warren Baffet always stated that it was not investing in computers and IT companies because their long-term development was difficult to predict.
However, the annual IBM report changed its view of investment in this sector.
According to Baffet, he had to understand very much earlier that IBM would first provide services and buy computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, the investment of Warren Baffet was considered as a rider.
IBM, a veteran IT-advance, has now received the title " Sir IBM".
In the Interview of the American Business Telephone, CNBC Baffet reported that he had received IBM actions from March to $10,7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest holders of IBM actions under 5.5 per cent.
Buffet said that even IBM had nothing to know about his participation.
He praised the management that could be achieved even during the financial crisis.
"They did great," said Baffet, meaning the manager.
The IBM was considerablely focused on high-incoming IT services such as dates.
The maintenance of the computer growth, which has been more than 100 years today, will also provide programming and advisory services, as well as powerful business computers.
By this time, the Baffet has avoided technology companies.
He said he was just investing in the companies he understood.
and investment, for example, in carriers of railway transport, in the production of wheat materials and in machinery building.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway has parts in a long list of largest companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (ex Münchener Back), together with approximately 80 their own daughters.
The 81-year-old obtained a small textile company in Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the most dear world firms with skilled investments.
His life, however, remained modesty,
By making it a colt figure for a number of investors around the world.
His nearly wrong instinct in making money brought him the call "Orakula from Omai".
The IBM share price increased by one per cent before the market opening after the Buffet investment announcement.
The "Gollow Giant", as IBM is still called, is on the funding bargain more than 220 billion dollars, which makes it one of the most decent high-technological companies of the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
But Baffet said he wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
Her foundation is Bill Gates, his close friend.
The Immortal Period
After finding "the cells in Cvicau" Turkey SMEs were doubted in the law of Germany.
One of the newspapers refers to "the blood ideology", which is now resumed to the surface.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of the right extremist ideology.
Furthermore, fear and disappointment have been reacted to this communication in Turkey and German-Turkey community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long forgotten fears.
There was no doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-ecstremistic network now found has a scale that is not yet fully aware.
"Birthing of blood ideology?" was the title of the Internet version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The journal Sabah, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret reporter of secret services, and expresses anxiety about the fact that German authorities could be in the right-extremist disease.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reactions are quietly mixed by the victims of racial hatred with silent piquet against Brandenburg gates in these outsides.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin on the ceremonie with the participation of German and Turkish policies has dismissed the fifty-year-year-old German and Turkish bilateral agreement on the most slave force.
The cooperation between two countries was presented in the world as a success history.
In some Turkish SMEs, it was a race. "The gift from Germany for the fifty-year-old" is the name of one of the articles on the Turkish Portal of Haber X, commenting on a series of murders.
The German of Hürriyet also did not lose the case of this parallel.
"It's starting bad to breathe" is the name of Ahmat Kulahji.
He notes that people who have been killed and contributed to Germany ' s conversion.
Police behavior and follow-up successful areas have been criticized by the German-Turkey forums.
The authors questioned why the German authorities did not think before to monitor suspicious suspiciousness in the right-extrémist circles.
The authors have reached a lot of ritoric. "If they continue to do so inevitably, the migrants will have no other choice except inflated self-defence."
"This will be the best self-defence."
"The peace in Germany is very dependent on how the whole network will be hidden and from the justice of punishment," says Selen.
The crimes in Meln and Zolingen in the 90s were an example of the threat of the world in Germany.
The photographs of the burned ruins in Zolingen were deeply impressed in the memory of Germans and Turks.
No other event showed that the Turks here were so obvious that they were threatened and that the Germans could have a real violence.
However, these crimes increased the feeling of Turkish unity.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press in that period was primarily condemned by the German police after attacks, and Helmut Cole refused to visit the survival in Melne.
He sent a telegram of disease to the President of Turkey after burning in Zolingen, but the participation in the Memorial ceremonie in Kelne adopted his Minister for Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kingel in its cases, recalled the taxes of Turkey in Germany,
As if he determined the value of humans by taxes he would.
Today, the Turkish SMEs have revealed the deepness of many German Turkeys to the current German State.
It clearly showed that it was necessary to do more than efforts to detect and re-evaluate the right-ecstremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bankscandal on the Suriach Lake
Most risked bank policies are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The UBS did not compromise during the financial crisis, and it was continually fighting with one, then with another crisis.
Now the German must be returned to the faithful course.
Alex Veber was probably not doubting that he was going to do this.
In July, after its effective entry from the head of the Federal Bank, it was declared that it would start at least at the least effective post in 2013, the Chairman of the Council of Directors of the Great Swiss Bank of UBS; an unexpected and advantaged carrier travel.
Alex Weber was manifestly excited, praised Switzerland for her beauty, UBS for the renewable reading and made a few friendly comments in the address of his future colleagues.
"UBS has changed to best."
"I'm waiting for a chance with Casper Phillyger and Oswald Grubel."
But in September, it was clear that everything would be different.
Traider UBS in London enveloped the bank security system and lost approximately 1.7 billion.
The Executive Director UBS Oswaldo Grubel, a bankier not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
From that point, the President of UBS's Board is considered sick, and everyone wants to know: When will Alex Veber finally come to his post?
Weber should consult the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Monday, the post of the President of the Council will take it already in May, not in 2013.
It's not easy for Alex Weber.
He is a Professor of Economy and Central Bank's Specialist, not a traditional bankier, and he certainly needs time for adaptation.
He suddenly became responsible for the bank, which again proved that he had deserved the call of "the greatest bank scandal in" for a long time.
The UBS, on the one hand, had been very big until recently managed by the most important assets in the world, and with other years, it was not out of scandal.
It seems that a fierce Swiss bank doesn't hurt anything.
Everything started during the financial crisis.
Before 2007, UBS had a reputation.
The bank had a shape of a hidden and sustainable, but at the same time, a fishing asset manager with both important objectives and an effort to become a major player in the investment banking.
As a result of 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, taking more money than any other bank in the world,
And as a investment bank, the world's largest banks were in the liga.
That was a impression.
Hans Geiger, former bankier and Professor of the Banking Affairs Institute for a long time, explains: "I have always brought UBS to my students as a model of good bank."
"He knows what we know now, you can ask how I could be wrong."
He was really a very mistake.
Only in 2007, it was clear that something was wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, the Executive Director Peter Woffley, who was considered a published intellectual, and at the same level as a bankier, was unexpectedly departed from his station.
A few months later, we could wonder why he left.
The bank's investment division tried to play on substantive value papers and had to record the billion.
You want to believe that you don't want, but UBS reported the increase of capital to 13 billion Swiss francs to resist the crisis.
Bank was really able to find investors - but investors whose services many bankiers would have recently refused - a very untransparent Asian subsidiary fund from Singapore and a Arab subsidiary fund that had not even been reported.
It was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it became much worse.
The Bank had to declare new losses, and the president of the Council of Directors of Marshall Ospell, the second on the level of payment chairman of the Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006, was delayed.
In October 2008, the catastrophe occurred, because of the lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS had occurred before the threat of crime, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank sold the UBS price papers for an unnamed number of billion, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Switzerland francs for the conversion commitment to become the owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was in shock: the country recognized the dramatic consequences of the fact that large banks were based in the small country.
Finally, the final UBS balance in 2007 was five times more than all Switzerland (see graph).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says the bank analyst Gager.
The second catastrophe was after the first.
A few months later, UBS capital of the US tax and stated that it was ready to transmit stated customers, which may be using the bank with taxes.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million from the refund of unfair income from business plus staff.
UBS thus recognized more or less that it was a instrument to eliminate taxes.
At the same time, UBS lost that it was always the privilege of combating rich customers, the secret detention.
After that, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors afterwards went to the department, and
The outcome of the customer's money started.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both main directions of its activities - in investing due to failure speculations and in the management of assets as a result of assistance and promotion of taxes.
And all was quiet, and it seemed that UBS could break the situation of this disaster with an apherist-treeder, and the single treater sent down 1.7 billion before the bank noted that something was wrong.
It is clearly that the management of risks in investment is not yet working.
"The incident with Aboboli clearly showed that the risk control was inadequate," said Martin Jansen, Professor of Economy and Finance at the Swiss Bank Affairs Institute of the University of Zurich.
The Financial Director of one of the largest German banks also doubts: "The UBS problem is that he has no instrument to control risks."
The long-term attention was made by Switzerland bankiers to protect the world's greatest assets is not too risk, but the security for money, unless the world was disrupted by the Alpine Resp or not.
Switzerland banks have become a symbol of uncertain confidence, such as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolizes a depressed cushion in the chocolate.
The UBS apartment in Zuriche has to be the image of a suitable Swiss private bank, but it is a little more.
It's a classic place.
The bank's head office is located in Zurich, in Banghofstrass, which is from the headquarters direct to the Zurich Lake, around the Swiss Mountains of Snow.
The opinions are incredible, and the rental rates for stores are one of the highest.
Among the traditional Swiss magazines like Confiserie Sprüngli here can be found such juvenile companies as Tiffany's.
Switzerland banks were available here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Crédi Suis court and the Elite Private Banks, such as Julius Ber.
The hard door is in UBS.
Under the walls covered by the walls are large skin wounds, a large order with the bank's pain.
UBS knows that he needs his clients, is confidence.
But both of the major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some time refused Switzerland's understanding of the banking, or, as the Chapter of one of the small Swiss banks, delivered them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the newspaper -- like all Swiss bankiers, he also cooperates with two largest banks.
He believes UBS is too large, particularly in the investment banking, where highly active angiosachs are.
His opinion, the Swiss people have nothing to add here.
"And if there's something, they have been adapted to English Saxon habits for a long time."
In fact, the Anglicaust Investment Banking has changed UBS, has brought him the first large income - and then fiasco - and no other financial institution has lost so much money in substantive assets in jungles as the major Swiss bank.
The catastrophe became manifest on 15 October 2008.
"In that environment, the coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people has made a larger surgery in the history of the country," says Lucas Hassig in his book UBS.
The politicians approved 68 billion Swiss francs (approximately 45 billion) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could that come?
If the Swiss banks ask, they will say that the problem is mainly in UBS.
Two of the three major Swiss banks joined one large group in June 1998.
The bank was established, which was too large for the small Switzerland at the time of smoking, and the bank that continued to grow.
This also helped two banks, which were UBS, supplemented each other; one was a rich but gradual bank specialized for asset management in Zurich; another was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly received access to the large amount of money they could use to cover the most powerful wheel.
Two names are UBS growing: Peter Wolfley, Executive Director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Opfel, president of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wolfley and Ophal were a team of laughing," says the bank analytical Hans Gager.
"Wolffley, who is an intellectual, low and deeply understanding models and statistics, and Ophal with his internal instinct, who has passed all the way on the top, starting with the stage in the bank."
But Ophell finally trusted Wolfley.
And Wolfley could make a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were real," says Gager.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Arrogance is before the distress.
The UBS are well-remembering meetings of the members of the Government, where Wolfley always repeated the same lounge - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he named the "turn table" where the banks were successful.
UBS wanted to go to the most of this table.
He got to make a part of this way.
UBS was the major player in the trade of monetary and public valuable papers.
Manufactured Governing Boards, however, indicated to the place, and the argument called " continuous income" in the bank termology was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had fallen in American hypotetic products.
To shut down the drum, UBS was involved in an avatuer that did not have food worth his life.
In order to grow, banks themselves and the hadge funds invested in American substantive price papers.
This has developed in a great mechanism that has enhanced the price papers on American and Potencial credits and sold them further, continued to be risked.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to get out of this process, UBS has not remained.
"UBS bought up until 2007, when the American insurance market was already in the fire," says the bank analytical Gager.
More growth is the deepest fall.
One manager had to go as long as the attempts to bring the bank into order were more difficult than the sleep seemed.
Posts to UBS have been converted into a stairs game and remain unexpected until this day.
Anyone who will submit this great bank is almost not responsible.
He must find a bank that returned to all business models.
Gager's bank analysis already has an idea - to refuse the investment banking, to focus on the management of assets and to forget its Swiss roots.
Bank, but it's not ready to go so far.
However, it is obvious that investment activities should be earnestly used.
The new Chapter of the Bank of Sergio Ermotti is planning to maintain its future on Tuesday.
The 51-one-year-old Switzerland bankier was actually considered as a temporary decision when the bank was unexpectedly diminished with his former Grubel.
In the past, he was able to show the nature and now, as the Zurich bank has declared on Monday, he has been entitled to UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotty plans to return the investment bank to the status in which it was in the middle of the 90s.
He reduces 3500 slaves.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How is he planning to buy money?
These questions are probably addressed by Axel Veber.
In public, he just said that they and his wife were looking for a apartment in Zurich.

Thinking walls fill the city
The players are considered a problem of birds in many places, and experts today say that these entirely intelligent birds will not be able to get out of the cities.
They loved birds, others wanted to be released as soon as possible.
The problem of the bird, however, is not far.
At the first symposium of the holidays, experts in Ler in Eastern Freedom claimed that the players were no longer able to get out of the cities.
Specialists throughout Germany discussed decisions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservationists claimed that the root of the problems in the cities was in migration by protected greens, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture was more distorted in traditional areas of residence.
Ohota, which expands the building and exhaustion of traditional trees, has complicated the life of birds.
The walls are under protection.
In the city of West in Westphalia and northwest in Jere, Dipholce, Ahime under Bremen and Lere, there are large initiatives that include more than 600 parent couples.
The inequality project of the bullets in Lere issued the inappropriate titles of the 2005 newspaper.
The critics described the fishing of birds in the jail and the throwing of their fingers as a cruel violence.
"The ordinary movement and disappointment don't give anything." said the designer and the Landscape Designer Verner Clever from Lera.
Consequences often have unexpected consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Caiser from Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"The lives are spread, and great divisions are divided and spread into other areas."
It is possible to be disappointed only with hospitals, elderly homes and schools.
"We have to live with them, and to leave them is not a option."
The problem in the cities will not be solved in the districts, says Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
The combination of fearing birds from the need to protect and encourage them to return to other areas could be an outcome.
"It's benzopile stains instead" was the louzing proposed by psychologist and etnological Utoy Maria Yurgens, which is due to a different approach to birds. "We must be sure of ourselves to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the fundamentals of the educational road in Asherberg in Slesvig Holstein, where in the intentional stages information about life is given to entirely thinking greens.
The project is already interested in tourists.
Jurgens also has its opinion on the claims of the sound that are produced by birds. "Sum transmits information, they have to tell each other much."
The wheel and laugh of these birds have entered into the ends, and the players often use not only weapons to enhance those who are insulted, but also make weapons themselves.
Behavior researchers at Cambridge University recently protested the measure of birds at four players.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they had to swallow on the rain to get a piece of prayer.
Without training, they recognized the size and form of the stone that was necessary to break the rain.
In the second experiment, comparative players had to resolve a more complex task.
The researchers placed a small wheel with a loop of prayer in a vertical cycle.
The birds couldn't get the shop.
But the researchers gave them a bullet.
All four birds were used with a wheel to make rubbers and ispoyes to cut it off and throw it out of the cycle.
Three of the four greens have already been attempted to do this.

Mass killings - a measurement
The stressed and very good new book of Peter Englond "Crasota and B: Personal History of the First World War", starts with a long speech of persons who die from the heart.
This is the advice to read: Cut this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very closely as Mr. Englindo's advice, and this list of persons will be your GPS, your master at the moments when, like one of these men and women, you will be from the road and loss of war.
Mr. England is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new persistent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, who condemns the Nobel Prize on Literature.
The book he wrote now, is incredible, he describes it, quite exactly as "Anti-History".
It has few names, important treaties, or famous fights; there are almost no jobs, journalists or discussions of taktics and fighting techniques.
It's not so much about what it was - he explains how "the book about what it was like," it's about " feelings, impressions, anxieties and the status of the spirit."
The book "Crasota and §b" with a single military experience of 20 years, more or less notable men and women, on both sides of the front, from schools and scientists to alpinists, doctors, leaders of quick assistance and workers.
These people will become heroes.
Someone's going to fall into the floor, lose his hand or his feet, with or die.
They live here as church lights: new ones are added to the ability of others, and some are at the same time lost.
Mr. Anglound's book is the outcome of the standard of historical books.
This is also the amendment to imagine that the First World War was only a harmful occupying war on the Western front.
The "Crasota and §b" is aware of other military theaters: Alp, Balkan, Eastern front,ropotamy, Eastern.
On the soldiers in this book, the olive oils fall; one of them meet Christmas in Egypt under the pyramides; the unsolved problem is the much of cece.
It's a wonderful book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people as a natural disaster, such as Katrina's urgant, who is inspired by an insult.
When you're not close to the canonada and you're a woman and you're home with the kids, you're staying on or you're going away?
So or else, who is it?
Almost no one understands what's going on and why we should fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," comments Mr. England, "is fulfilled by opinions, suggestions, hopes, fears, advanced ideas, the theories of interviews, murmures, cosmars and listeners."
The "Crasota and BB" is a trial of people such as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young seasman of the German Flow open sea.
Their stories are primarily taken from memories, letters and other materials already spent.
The stories of their lives may be incredible or incredible, but they are at the highest level alive through the small moments and detailed detailed by Mr. Englindo.
Many of them are about the ignorance and how to cope with them.
His story of the German school, he says, "Erzaz, everywhere."
"Substitute coffee, subdividual aluminium, unusual refining, paper boxes, tree bullets."
He continues to tell about the feeding in Germany.
He describes the "meat of the pressed rice in the wheat (and the fake bone made of the tree); the tabac made of dry roots and of dry cartoon; the bowl of the tree."
It notes that "837 registered meat replacements authorised in the production of coffee, 511 registered coffee replacements."
History reports honesty and courage.
One American observes the burden of violence and says about the war, "You feel that, at the end, it is what men have been created, not to sit in a pleasant chair with cigarette and whisky, evening newspaper or bestceller, and say that this show is civilization and is not hidden under your appealed rubber."
In contrast, the British soldier notes that he will mostly die and that no one will notice it or grieve.
"When a man is humbled with the idea of self-sufficientness, he would like to think that it is happening before p," he wrote.
But in contrast, it looks like "the convicted person who is secret."
Other comments are cased with the oldly devastated and new types of fear.
"Conflict has become more economically involved," says Mr. Englond, "the military negotiations."
He notes the arrival of one who calls "new species in the beginning centuries: beautifully expressed and ideologically conquered mass killer in a well-scapped costum, which builds a rain sitting behind the writing table".
People are unpredicted: decreasing actions are the same as heroism.
Mr. Englund reported about soldiers who were at all trying to put the prostitute on Veneric disease to escape services on the front.
"The same gross expression of this can be seen in the trade of honourable genius, which the soldiers had and washed by genitals in the hope of getting into the hospital," he wrote.
"The unexpected ones inclined him into the eyes, which often led to a living blindness."
Translated by the Swedish Peter Greyz, Mr. Englond's prosis, is a guilty but nebrian, suitable for his humanitarian task.
In decades of small scenes, he shows how the war "freeed completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders make them war.
The best books about the I World War often were inconsistent, such as "Great War and modern memory" Paul Fass' or Romans, such as "The Western Front without change" Erika-Mary Remark, rather than historical works.
Mr. Englound's book is inside this unsamplable panteon.
His book has the most final that I can remember in an inappropriate literature.
I won't tell him.
But it's like he went up from the book to the page with a slip person, took it out of your hands and burned it with a bottle.
After the previous error, a highly calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers were assigned to the operation, some of the protective ships.
The nights from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because the Zucotti Park had to be at least all people at that time.
The operation was held secretly from all other other than several high-leavened officers, and the rest of the dream said that they were going to learn.
The Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was in the centre of events, and his presence stressed how much importance the Department of Police was given to the operations.
It could not also be said of the repeated events of the last weeks, such as the use of gases against protestants, which opposed the rules of the department and caused the uragan of the sympathetic p to the occupants.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, the police operation on the release from the protesting Zukotti Park began.
The authorities were prepared by watching the disappointment of occupation in other cities.
The most important anticrisis teachings were conducted on the Rendels Island with the Zucotti account.
The authorities increased the number of so-called trains in the case of anxiety - anti-terrorism measures that provide a rapid movement of a large number of police - in terms of the Lower Manhattan.
After the training, it was held on Monday on the Manhattan side of East River.
The order to enter the park came in "the last minute", explained the source known to the orders in which only the "treating" was mentioned.
"The more of the cops I know and who have been called to this case did not say they were sent to Zucotti Park," said the man who spoke under anonymity conditions.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were at the highest stations in the department."
One of the reasons for secretship was a lesson that approved the city.
On October 14, the authorities wanted to clean the park, but they were rejected before hundreds of protestants who were running within the appointed time asking about these plans.
The operation was involved in various police offices on Tuesday, including the forces of the districts of the police teams, which usually were used to control crime areas.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost as to them, come and leave the park during the day, which makes 1 hour of night a suitable time for employment.
"It was right to do this when the park is at least all the people," he said.
The machines saved services with projectors and speakers, gathered on Pick-Slip and Franklin Roswell-drive, around the Manhattan pool before moving forward.
The manufacturer and the previous recorded announcements from the voice speakers have feared many protesters.
When the Officers of Administrative Departments entered the park, many protesters simply gathered their things and left.
The police reported that the tents were not touched until 1:45 night, giving the protestant time to gather things.
Other police groups, according to evidence, were gathered in perimeter to enter the park in case of arrests.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, representative of the Department of Police, said that it was done for their security.
But many journalists claim that they haven't seen the police's work and that the police's faced them.
Mr. Brown said that cars with television cameras on the Church Street, along the west border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police passed the west through the tissue of similar protesting things, including bottles, plastics and polyethylene bottles, full clothes, the healthy department's teams followed it and collected what was broke.
Some protesters who refused to go outside have shown it in the Internet.
The basic group of protesters took positions near the cooking camp at the centre of the park.
There were barricades built, and the police were inside and methodically arrested them.
About 10 people in the epoch have a camp of sk together.
And two people were touched by the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
In order to cut the locks, there were challenges to save services.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The cargo operation was completed in about 75 minutes, reported the police.
Mr. Brown said that about 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority were arrested for "the violation of the public and opposition in detention," he said.
The highest officer was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Department and officer of the Department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the department's deputy police, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, even though he was present, "not run operation," Mr. Brown said.
The second group of police was expected at the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, in the case of income.
The buildings were placed on Cortland Street, north of the park, and on the Pain Street, south quarter.
The observers saw that the police had extended the perimeter from these places even beyond the Zukotti Park borders.
On one occasion, observers saw that the group of police, many with shields, had struck people further.
Approximately 28 people were on the north perimeter.
From the most serious events of the night, the park had occurred south.
About five to the south of the Pain Street, one of the protesting prisoners put the police car on the cup, and others, according to the evidence, released the air from the skin of the police car.
At a time, a fucking hole of faner was flying.
As a result, one of the police and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The training of the school staff will be made to the city in court for freedom
A promotion that represents hundreds of school service staff who lost places last month plans to judge the city in the middle of the city, claiming that freedoms were not and discriminatory because of non-proportional impact on schools where poor students are learned.
The judicial proceedings are probably the last means available to the Procured Board 37, trying to cancel the release.
Seventy-seventy-two school assistants, co-ordinators with parents and other employees who were among the most lowest payable employees in the city, lost their place on 7 October, because the leaders of the Profesion called a political response to their refusal to give access to the city to the medical funds managed by the slave groups to close the holiday budget.
The citizens rejected this accusation.
At hearings in the City Council last month, the officer of school Dennis M. Walcott said that freedoms were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the members of the Pair Council said to him that there was no indication in the budget that the aid staff would be released.
The 37 representatives of the Environmental Council reported that they had notified the claims by warning the Department of Education against it; the press conference will be held in the middle of the press to declare the formal request for the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department will be listed as responsibles and eight temporarily released guardians will be counted as issues, all of them are black or Latin American women, as well as most assistants, lose their places.
Elizabeth Thomas, representative of the court of the Department of the city, said that the city hadn't seen the request and therefore could not comment on its specific positions.
In the preliminary version of the complaint held in New York Times, the promotion focused on a number of school releases in the poor areas of the city to support the accusation of unfair treatment, acknowledging that poor schools have lost more assistance because they are chronicly unfinanced.
He points out that while there were no releases in State Island and at the highest Side or Tribeca schools, 17 students had lost schools around 23 in Brownsville, B.I.E., and 46 had to go to the surroundings 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
Remarking the loss of five of eight school assistants, work in a free average school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students will be poverty, states: "This is not the areas of the staff parents who can find money to carry out the budget."
P.S. Budget 36 was decreased by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate additional accounts for each poor participant who is going to school.
The Profession also states that the director of school could be misleaded by the language of notification that allows coordinators to be released with parents.
The word "exception" was reported in the notice, although the "overlining" is often referred to when a teacher of the school is moved into a list of the names of the students to which the central office will pay.
"Sixty-six coordinators have been released with parents," says the brain wants, "not just translated."
Mission, Congress ready for the Libya Agreement
It seems that the repurchase and democracy at the Capitol Hall are finally ready to agree on something that has a view of resurrecting in Libya.
All that was needed is to succeed, the ancient dictator Musamar Kaddafi was taken into the gain and killed, and the American implication has been completed.
On Monday, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of Senata should consider the resolution taken by President John Carry (democracy, Massachusetts) together with Senators John ́Keen (resp, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (individual, Conne`kut), who praises the Lieutenant for the successful Resurrection and the American military for the "respiration".
"The meaning of this resolution is to give respect to the courageous people of Libya when they begin to restore their country," Carrie said.
"This is under support of their democratic stripes by both parties."
The language may seem to be unnecessary, but no more discussion on Libya was easily passed.
In this year, the legislators of both parties disputed each other and the White House on the formulations of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the American Army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Carry and Kein held a resolution that allows the use of American armed forces in Libya to be able.
The draft legislation was the opening of the representatives of the Palace by the major majority of the votes of both parties, and thus did not vote in Senate.
However, on the same day when the draft legislation was laid down in the Palace of representatives, the Palace also did not support a proposal that would have been broken by the American Operation in Libya.
This left the American mission in some kind of purification law - when the Congress was sufficiently disturbed to criticize the approach of Obama to the mission, but not so bad to actually cut the ground out of its feet.
The Congress ' s insolvency
In August, Tripoli was delivered to libanese rebels, and on October 20, Caddafi was killed.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The Resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs " is encouraged by the people of Libya for its incredible courage and sustainability in the desire to freedom" and thanks to men and women of the United States armed forces and their coalition partners who were involved in the military operation for the protection of the Libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and uninterrupted transition to democracy in Libya".
Will new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Council or distorted by legislators as the June draft law?
Contrary to the latter version, Senator Richard Mr. Luger, the leader of the replies in the Committee.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the last version of the law project.
On the other hand, the Court of Representatives of the Court must discuss the constitutional amendment required by the balanced budget, the main legislative priority for each representative and for some democrats in the Congress.
This measure, proposed by the Council of Representatives of Bob Goodla (Resp, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other thing you will be held to the plenary vote of the Congress.
Other legislators were not able to bring their amendments to the plenary stage, but not because they did not try.
The amendment of Gudilla is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that affect the broad range of issues that were in this connection.
They doubled - one and the same legislative project was introduced to the Council of Representatives and to Senate - other were a little alternative.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendments on the balanced budget only in the Council of Representatives and more on " the control of federal expenditure".
They are also identical, but they give their authors, in particular to the freshly designed replies, who want to improve their summary, the possibility to be surprised that they have "communicated" such a proposal.
The Committee on Budget Control, which passed in August, requested that the Council of Representatives and the Senate vote for the amendment to the balanced budget.
In March 58 of the Senators' vote for an unbinding resolution supporting the idea of such amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to deal with the number of terms of members of the Conference, and member of the Court of Representatives of Hose Serrano (democracy, New York) wants to cancel the commitment for the President for two times.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson (democracy, Illinois) proposed amendments to ensure, in addition, the right to quality education and health.
The amendment that prohibits single marriages has been for many years, as one other prohibiting the flash burning.
The legislators also want to allow the abrogation of federal laws if two thirds of the states are affected.
Whatever the members of the Congress have tried to make amendments, they are moved faster than in the past years.
At the 111th convocation of the Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments and 66 in 110th.
This temperature notes compared to the beginning of the 1990s when the members of the Congress, according to the Senate, have made more than 150 amendments each two years.
But they did not have success more than now.
After the amendment adopted, - 27th was approved in 1992, but it was actually in 1789 at the Congress.
"The killed but not won't," says Gibfords in his first television interview after temptation
Ten months after the armed person shot it in an opposition to public business in Tusone, the member of the Palace of the representatives of Gabriel Gibfords (democracy party, Arizona) on Monday evening on the federal channel, submitted a Melodie from the "Sol will return tomorrow" show and said that he wanted to heal more than to return to the Congress.
In the 20/20 Aby News programme with Diana Soyer, Gibfords had a hard form of proposal and needed assistance in the walking.
The programme on its difficult way to restore after the trauma of a powder, which broke the powder and wrapped the left side of the brain, walking from front to back of it.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the Palace of representatives and triumphed on the draft law on the border.
In his first television interview after the January shooting, in which six and 13 people were killed, Gibfords laughed, laughed and sing - and called her health "needs".
The question of Soir, how she feels, 41-year-old Gibfords answered, "Very good."
Interview with Gibfords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the "20/20" special issue, which was shown on the date of the outcome of the new book of Gabby's wives: The history of courage and hope.
The speech was reported on the restoration of Gibfords after the shot of January 8th.
On the first few weeks of Kelly's video, she's on a hospital cock with a breathe and a long shirt on the hall.
She can only lift up one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Gibfords sits in the box, and physiophers teach her how to do simple actions.
I'm stuck with you.
Get the lips out.
And then her first word, "What."
For a few days, Gibfords said the second word -- "tost", please change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by Aby-si demonstrates that she played a central role in the Healing of Gibfords: we see the congressman sing with the doctors "The girls just want to enjoy" and "Free Fall" to Tom Petty.
At the interview of Sawyer Gibfords, who was two hours a day on the procedure, said he would not remember the day of temptation.
Her husband told him that he had read the article of Gibfords in the 12 March's shooter when she stopped him to ask for the six killed at that time.
The suspicious attacker Jerd Lee Laffner contains Missouri and is obliged to treat the court.
"A lot of people have died," said Gibfords Sawyer.
"Heavy, hard, hard."
One time during her healing, Cally Sawyer said, "I'm hungry."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not winning," said Kelly.
You're just killed.
And you're going through it, you're healthy, and you're going back more than ever.
Armies feel more regret than respect
The enterprise was a holiday at Wall Street, who collected millions of dollars for homeless winds in New York.
Kid Rock slept a battle of unhelp, disappointment, and losses.
A number of hundred soldiers, mariners, aircrafts, and marine pecotics were designed around him.
The audience in the smoking aplods stands to him.
"On military servants looked like heroes," said David Zalzman, who organized a business collection of money.
The elder of the military officer on the concert, who was also the president of the Committee of Chefes of the Staff, admired Mike Mallen, and had the role of the army in other ways.
The officer wrote, "They were walking like the poor."
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really a respect, it was a lamentation.
The opposite impressions illustrate the difficulties between the army and often the equivalent, sometimes excited American p.m.
The soldiers thank for their victims.
But thanks have their price, they say military servants.
P'a's more like it's like that it's a lot of grief to people in the form.
"We are not all victims," said Brigadian General Shawn B. Farland, who commanded army in Iraq and was going to Afghanistan.
"But, the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unfortunate."
This is a sensitive topic for military leaders who do not want to look ungrateful or ungrateful with the society they serve.
They also realize that the wrath of the returning army in the last years of war in Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, the majority of the complaints have occurred quietly and only between the veterans.
After the two of his sons returned from the fighting of the sea pitch, the Colonel Mark Kanshn's relief warned them that non-army people would look at their service from two points of view.
They will look on them with anger because they have wounded the rebels and were in exotic places.
Others will think if "under the mask' worst veteran" is hidden," said Kanshan, who was fighting in Iraq, and when he returned, took a high government post in Washington.
As he was looking for, he said, he felt that some interviewers were promptly asked whether he would be able to endure the pressure of the responsible work in Washington once after the fighting.
Kenschn remembers how he said to his sons, "When you tell about your service, you must count on negative effects."
The disturbance of wars is partly occurred from the American insufficiency to wars.
Congratulations on the fighting field are rarely obtained from a country that is not familiar with the army and sees a little direct benefit from war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was usually in the Second World War," says General Lieutenant David Bernow, who commanded American armies in Afghanistan.
Instead, the promotion of policies and p ́s is mainly focused on the depth of military service suffering.
Armies evaluate the number of income they have made, the number of companions they have lost or lost.
The Army is increasingly pressured by the parties against violence
This week on historical audiences should be decided whether 28 men and women against the army of accusation of violence will be taken.
If not, hundreds of issues will be set up in line with those.
The first class of Elizabeth Lyman was born 25 years and on the 11th week of advancement, by the night, was violated by her assistant.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her carriage at the airport of Miramar, north of San Diego after dinner with another, and met a man-servant with a 12 beer bottle.
He asked if he could come to her in a drink.
"This was a red flag," says Lyman.
But Texas' birthday rejected his threats.
I thought he was 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instinct."
Just a few minutes after they entered Liman's commit, the man came to her back, fell and violated, confirmed it.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 of the current and would have been stressed to wait for the decision of the court on historic hearing, which is held in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether the court they have made against the former Minister of Defence of Robert Gates and his president Donald Rasmfeld.
It states that Gates and Ramsfield were not able to cope with a widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Isk, given in February by Susan Berk from Washington, D.C., included 17 issues, but up to 28 per months, 25 women and three men who all claim that they were subjected to violation or threat of sexual violence by the servants and that the army had not appropriately investigated, did not pursue a judicial order or did not secure appropriate justice after the assumed attacks.
Burk says she was healed on the top of the army, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are those who can destroy the murder of violence?
Burk also states that it has been associated with some 400 other victims from February, many of which may participate in the future searches.
It is: Rather than collecting all the eggs in this matter, it will open a lot of things if it needs to support pressure.
The Defence Defence Defence Department of the Federal Prosecutor of Neal Braid took steps to stop the matter.
The Court documents received by Newsweek reveal protection - mainly that former or current soldiers cannot claim the army for the damage of inflammated forces.
The Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by military services by the Supreme Court of Justice of 1950.
"The proposed damage will be to the risk of the military office of issues," states the documents.
The Defence Minister refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 50s.
Although women have been officially prohibited to participate in the fight, this division is only in words: modern wars are often reading the front line.
And in Iraq, and in Afghanistan, women and soldiers play a more important role, especially in contacts with women in fighting areas.
Results: In the period between two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them were fighting.
The army is too time to become modern, says Berk.
She is not alone in her fight; in addition to her request, three others are ready.
In the Yellow Jurid, Seminar jurid of the winds office prepares against four major military academies for accusation of the promotion of the genocide atmosphere.
The non-Comercial Unit of American Weather War in Vietnam has prepared a dispute against the army, in the centre of which the "changing of persons" diagnosis is to be victims of violence in order to remove them from the service, is a usual manifestation, as said by the activists such as Anu Bhagvati from the right-defence group, of the Organization of Women-Werming Services.
In December, its group made an application against the Office of Veterinary Affairs by accusing him of discrimination to consider pensions from people who claim to have been threatened by sexual violence during the service.
Nine of the departments of law projects held in a number of measures were held at the Congress by the Group of Senators and members of the Palace of representatives of both parties.
In 2010, in order to warn and combat sexual violence by the Ministry of Trade, 3 158 tentatives were reported.
However, it is not often notified of attacks, and, according to Pentagon's own estimates, this number consists of about 13.5 per cent of the 19.000 cases that occurred in that year.
This report also examines the percentage of the cases in March: In 2010, 20 per cent of cases came to the court - twice less than in the civil justice system.
The islanders in the case of Berk are only the first of their attacks in a number of other trauma.
In the case of Lyman, she declared violence in the military field less than a hour after it happened.
On that night, she said, she was asked to tell the detail of violence at 11 times by the police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of proofs of violence, and the blood of the attacking - from the broken hand - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting before the judges who were asked if she had sex with her friend on the day of the attack.
Six people gave a local characteristic to the accused one who was finally justified.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was borrowing now, I fled from the court room with a cry."
"They put me into a psychiater, and when I went out, I remember that my commander said, "This wasn't a trial against him, it was a trial for me."
Liman was invited to address the military psychiater, which finally had a change in the personality that had made it inappropriate to the service.
In January 2010, she was approved with an uncomfortable formula that did not allow her to receive any funds.
Whether Liman and her companions are going forward, it is a complicated question, says John Terley, professor of law at the University of the University of George Washington.
However, he notes, "I think they are able to move forward."
There's a trial between them and the verdict that criticizes the way she appeared.
I've criticized Dr. Ferres all my life.
The army was left for decades because she has no stimulation and retaining funds that are responsibility.
He adds, "The chances are greatly contrary to them, but it is important for them to try."
These things will only be changed when the ordinary people are going to be.
If the hearing is not in their benefit, Berk, the issuer, will have hundreds of other insights for the future.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happened before.
The wall has eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before being a new person of the right extremism in the face, Anders Bering Breewick was a usual guy who expressed his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Briwick, who was aware of the conclusion of a mass murder in Norway in July, which led 77 persons to life, appeared to his first open audience.
Although Briwick was able to stand alone, he was no longer unique on the network: he had long been preparing for an attack on his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support rights groups in networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Let's just go to Facebook.
"We realized that it was very unfortunate for them," says Jamie Bartlett, the author of the recent report on the British Cyber Populism of the Demos Centre of Investigation.
The reserve of personal data on Facebook is so big, says Bartlett that researchers can easily use a reklame tool to determine a demographic group with scientific accuracy - that marketetologists and have been doing a few years.
The Bartlet's command found half a million of staff of the right groups throughout the world and then submitted advertising to them, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the advertising made the user a question about their education, violence and optimism in their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10 000 participants were able to ask 14 extreme right parties in 11 countries, even without the office.
"This is a completely new way to conduct research," says Bartlett.
The results are not so vulnerable: the online sites of right groups are most often young men of men, the lack of immigration.
But unexpectedly, "they who associate their online activity with offline activity are more democratic and less aggressive than those who are only hidden behind the monitor."
The DEMOS work is only one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and policeologists use the website to study all in the light - from the health issues to the trends expressed in the " Laika", the residues on the wall and the status updates.
With more than 800 million active users added in average to three records per day, Facebook's super-active information causes research in the Boom by increaseing the number of scientific articles called the site in the header by 800 per cent in the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook is a pleasure that it gives the opportunity to study people who are not able to arrive on the street with a block.
"If you would like to ask people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You should enter the party and they would never accept you," says Bartlett.
"Facebook's excluding all this -- you're referring to them stressed."
Others say that this site would be able to find and investigate health problems.
The recent investigation of Dr. Megan Moreno from Wisconsin University, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drinking trends on Facebook were much more risked than students who were silent in this behavior.
Moreno assumes that students, such as their community teachers, could monitor the website and interfere to help a student who is too frequently updated by drinking status.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," reported Washington Post Dimitri Christkis, co-operator Moreno and Director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Development at the Children Scientific Research Institute.
"We found a way to find children from a group of risks that would not otherwise be found."
Facebook also continues to draw out a variety of data about its users.
The data group on the website on the status statistics and the day of St. Valenna, the electors in the middle of 2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (in the main way, using information that only has access to them, the Cyber Freedom Champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data available for the survey).
But Facebook users know that the site watchs them, they like it or not -- in exchange of opportunities to play in Scrabble with a friend who is in thousands of miles from you, the site can handle your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of an investigation they don't even know?
Although researchers have strictly certain norms for offline investigations, online data are generally available.
"I don't think that many users would think at least of what studies could be observed by their prophecies," says Neil Selvin, sociologist from the London science laboratory, on the investigation that he had conducted in 2006 with the use of general accessible students in Facebook.
As they imagined, it was only between them and their friends.
Then there is a question of methodology.
Even offline does not guarantee that the object of the investigation is too honest.
The Facebook does not have to know the number of information in the profile and the user's pages true.
"What you say at Facebook, and what you're doing behind Facebook are two absolutely different things," says Celvin.
That is why, despite the years of his technology research, Selvin believes that blocking and rounds are still the best research instruments of those that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the outcome of the real world and communicate with real people," he says.
"The investigations are supposed to be about, and most of them are still going offline."
Anders Bering Breewick will first be presented before the court
Anders Bering Briwick, a person who recognized a double attack organized by 77 people in Norway this year, described himself as a fighter for "opposition" during the first public appearance of the court in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Opposition Motion and Ricary Tamplier Norway," he said before 500 present in the court room.
"I express the judgment because you have received your mandate from organizations supporting hatred ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize action, but I don't confess the guilt."
Judge Thorkyel Neshaim interrupted Brivic during this monologe, 'for he was not going to give Bravic the opportunity to hear this as a plan to express his own views.'
For the same reason, he refused to allow Bravic, who had brought the first written thing with him, to contact the victims at the end of the hearing.
Neshaim also commanded the police to keep Bravic under more than 12 weeks, prohibited access to MMIs for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take a close control of all visits and rescription for eight weeks.
About 30 years of age and the victims’ families visited the hearing.
They hoped to see Brivey in the eyes, and others - to make sure he was locked.
They all came to find answers to their questions.
"I'm that he looks cold and disgusting," told the Norwegian NRK channel one of the survivors on Ottoy.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally, I got a little more than I saw and heard the suspicious."
Brywick, clothed in dark and blue, kept calm and professionalism during all hearing and looked at journalists and survivors when he entered and went out of the opinion.
Although Briwick was a strange idea that he was a part of the great "opposition" movement, the judge claimed that he was not a fool and said that there was no evidence of what he had done with the partners.
Some may be quiet that attacks appear to be one extremist on July 22, not a radical group.
But this does not decrease automatically worse and laughing that the whole nation feels now.
"I would like him to look like a monster, but it's not true," said the family of one victim.
"It would be much easier if it would."
7 lessons from the lost interview of Steve Jobs, which are held in the theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical gene as the Great Issuer of modernity.
But that Apple employees can consider the greatest open in the recently discovered interview, which had been reminded of the preliminary shows on the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a murderer, and he felt a hippy, but he was also an advanced organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business players suffered from "the sickness to think that the really great idea is 90 per cent of work... [but] a great idea of the large product is a great amount of experience".
Go back in 1995, Bob Kiringley created a Telescope Triumf on the emergency of a personal computer, and spent more hours with Jobs after a unique long-term conversation.
At that time, about 10 years since Jobs was released from Apple, and he has already worked at his new computer company NeXT in waiting for the Internet mass accommodation.
While the small part of the Kringley interview was used in Nerdah, he says original interviews about transportation.
Only after Jobs' death, the full VHS copy was found in the register garage.
This recorded material, a little designed, is based on the 68-minute Steve Jobs movie: the loss of interview in Landmark Theaters in this environment and Thursday.
For a man who hates his detailed interview, Jobs is unusually ready to express his technology philosophy and business strategies.
And incrediblely imaginable.
At four different moments during the interview, there are big intervals between questions and answers -- thinking for 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly excited his thoughts to say more accurately.
Moreover, there are moments where the perfectionism of Jobs is on the surface where he is aware of the issues of Kringley, which cause him to go quickly to issues or events of greater importance.
The Potterian interview has something more prophecy when Jobs assesses what, as he sees, different companies do right and wrong, and has its own vision of future involving technologies.
One thing is to read about Jobs' evaluations, but there is something that is vulnerable and inspiring in Jobs, which we see here, an anxious murderer on the road.
He has a vision of what things might be and should be.
In the way after he said everything here, he went and did it.
Small review of the seven significant conclusions of the Periodic Interview:
How he learned to handle business:
"Why are you doing this?" and the answers that you unchangedly get, "Oh, that's just what you do."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks about business very deeply.
That's what I learned.
Jobs continues to detailly describe its trials to rationalise the reporting in Apple.
The disappointed way of recording of expenditure, often started with the "standard costs", which were taken from the floor and then subsequently undertaking, created an auto-determined structure that guarantees that they would be able to follow business expenditure to small.
About Daddy's shot:
Jobs relates detailedly about the blue box that he has mastered with Steve Vosnack, a device that has enabled people to broke the phone company effectively and call to large distances free.
Many of the devices were written before, but the Jobs Afory here, when the blue box is described as an infectionate act.
He explains how he and Boznak tested the box using the phone-automates, ordering and then submitting from one AT&T network to another until they were connected as far as possible.
"We've covered the earthquake of half a half times, and you're crying to the phone, and it's been a minute later in the neighbor's phone auto," says Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and everything we have approved is that we could make something that could control billion dollars of infrastructure throughout the world."
We both knew a little bit, but we could make a small thing that could control the big thing -- it was a wonderful lesson, and I don't think Apple could ever come without that.
Jobs continues to describe a famous outcome that he and Voznak were practically performing by calling to Vatican through a blue box in the midnight and asking Papa's phone by trying to copy Henry Kissinger.
When the different catholic members were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomate, these two were dismissed immediately before the Pope was raised to answer on the phone.
About the love of technology (and the cold call of Bill Hulet):
At the age of 12 years, he found Bill Hulet in the phone manual and called him.
After their 20-minute phone, Jobs received a summer in Hulet Packard.
"This has shown me a strong impact, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it has made my view of what it is and how well they are relating to their own."
Jobs later is one of the HPs, visiting the laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer".
He had a size of a chairman, he had a small monitor with a electron-berry tube, and I loved it.
I often went into the HP growth and rolled around the car and wrote a program for it.
Improved innovation:
In a number of places, the interview of Jobs is talking about the acquisition of new products in the summer.
At the time of his career, when he went to sell a pool of montage, one purchased him to gather a whole computer.
With only 30 days of credit, he had to consider the collection and delivery of prepared devices.
Later in Apple he reminds the difficulties he faced by developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the angry disputes... they cried on me that it would take five years [to collect the mouse that would cost $300] and I was thrown up and went out and found the designer."
Nine hundred days later we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was unbelievablely confidential.
About large companies that lose energy:
As long as he raised Apple's regeneration, Jobs claimed exactly how many leaders of adults fail to see the situation and lose control over their market share.
"Let's think you're working in IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopole on the market, so the company doesn't become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [this are the types of people] who are finally guided by companies, and those who make product are exhausted from the area of decision-making.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolist position is disappointed by people who do not have any idea of the difference between good and bad products of the needed art.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take the whole industry of in-technology.
He could be ten times more, he could be the Microsoft 90...
They have been killed from the winner.
Innovation as a form of experience:
"The great idea of the big product is a great number of experienced work... when you broke a great idea, it changes and it's going to."
You're going to know a lot about her tongues.
There are compromises that you need to go -- some things you can't force to make electronics, glasses, robots or machines.
You need to keep in 5.000 ideas, these concepts, and they are all together...
Finally, everything is going to be nice -- it's all about trying to express yourself in the best way that people have ever produced, and later, trying to bring it into what you're doing.
Picaso said the good artists were copying, the big artists were driving.
We've always been shameful to fight great ideas.
The part of what has been done to the famous Macintosh was that people who worked on it were the artists, the poets, the artists, the zoologists, the historics that had become the best experts in the area of the invention technologies in the world.
If not in-in-formation technologies, they would have done things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are concerned with the opponents of the Health Law until the court examines the matter
On the day when the Supreme Court gathered behind the closed doors to discuss a political question whether he would listen to the derogation of President Obama's health law, his two judges, Antoine Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were departed by the sponsored court of a company who would deal with the case before the high court.
This case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the penitentiary information.
One of the works in the agenda was a venue supported by 26 States, which promoted a streaming health review adopted by the Congress last year, which united the conservative activists of the whole nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the return debates were expected in March 2012 at 5 and 1/2 hours, and the outcome would mostly become a mistake in the presidential round, which would be in the worst time when the decision was proclaimed.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the Health Protection Law should be canceled, mostly, will be Paul Clement, who was a representative of the General Prosecutor during the presidency of George W. Bush.
The Clemens' legal company, Bancroft P.C., was one of nearly two decades of firms who helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federal Society, a long-term group who continued to discharge the legal principles of conservation.
Another company, who sponses dinner, represents one of the trade associations that discharged the law, the National Federal Party of independent business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical hygiene Pflizer Inc, which has a great financial interest in the outcome of difficulty.
The dinner was held at Washington Hotel a few hours later after the court meeting.
It was, among others, Mitch · Connel, the leader of the reprisonants in Senate and the opposer of the Health Protection Act.
Earnest guests on both sides?
Nothing new: Two judges have visited the Federal Community's activities for years.
And this doesn't oppose ethical standards.
The judges are actually free from the Code of Behavior, which regulates the action of the lower federal courts.
If they were subjected, they might be under the Code of principle 4C, which states: "The Court may visit the activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge cannot be a rapporteur, a honourable guest or to be mentioned in the programme of such activities."
However, the manifest nearby of Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as to the company with great financial interests, was a sufficient signal for the ethical activists in the Government.
"It is a cruel violation of the ethics and the independence of the code against the statements of certain judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Joint Action.
"The courts have been drunk and dinnered at an official collection of money with the cases which are currently discussed in the court."
Their appearance and participation in the collection of money for this business underlines all statements of impartiality and is inappropriate.
Scalia and Thomas are focusing on critics who say that they mix the cases of the court with the groups of federalists in cases.
And the wife of Thomas, Jenny, is the activist of conservators.
Moreover, the conservators claim that this is an ethical issue against the judge of Elena Kagan, rather than Scalia and Thomas.
Cagan was the main court of the service of the Obama Administration, when the first judgments against the law were submitted at the court of the first instruction.
Her critics had requested Kagan from hearing this case because she was too able to protect the law then to be inconscient now.
Kagan doesn't think she's going to do that.
Boeing receives a 18 billion recorded order on a plane
The Emirates Air Company orders 50 broadband liners Boeing 777 and may be 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the share size - more than 1 billion dollars.
This is a food news that the company receives order for 50 units of its production.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft, and the pre-score price for all these 50 aircrafts is $18 billion.
The same is important where Boeing received the order: The Middle East, which provides the golden lives of the future plane orders.
In the prognoses on Monday, the Chicago company recalls that the Middle East will need 2.520 aircraft at 450 billion.
Boeing announcement in these outputs is the biggest in the dollar equivalent order for commercial aircrafts - 50 two-passed Boeing 777 aircrafts.
An incredible order was made from the Emirates Air Company in Dubai.
The aircraft also has the opportunity to buy 20 other aircrafts, which will raise the total pre-score price to $26 billion, stated Boeing at Aviashow Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing, Oman Air, reported about six Boeing 787-8s, so called Dreamliner, which could be a significantly better fuel economy and niceness for passengers.
The pre-score price for six aeroplanes is more than 1 billion dollars.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said the Morningstar Nil Dior's analysis.
"The amount of these specific buyers is sufficiently high."
Many near-eastern aircrafts have oil lands.
Therefore, they have not only money to pay for the aircraft but also the growth of fuel prices that usually affect the aircraft, as one of the largest articles of the costs is not so losing because the country wins money at high prices for oil.
It is important, since they are less likely than other aircraft companies to cancel the order of aircraft when prices grow, said Dior.
"They have natural protection," he said.
Emirates order strengthens Boeing's leadership on the broad-flight aircraft market and helps not to allow Airbus SAS's opposite to reach his mastership with his A350 airline.
The winning Boeing on the airport occurred four months after Airbus stated that it would deduce the largest A350, which was opposed to 777-300ER.
He gave the debt to increase the axe charge after the purchasers needed to increase the lowlife and the distance of the flight.
Boeing Co action increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
President's sister, obviously, lost elections in Michoacan
Louisa Calderon claims that drug traffickers have assisted the opposer Fausto Valecho from the IRP in the pre-elective box.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon, not about her request to the place of Governor Michoacan during the oppressed state elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers had been helped to deal with one of its opposers.
The preliminary results of the leader of the west Governor are called Fausto Valecho from the Institution-Revolutional Party, or IRP.
"Including organized crime during all the election process and especially yesterday, not only for Michoacan, but also for the whole country," said Louise Mary Calderon at the radio interview on the day following the resurrection vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electors on elections,... they took a vote furnace, put obstacles... and made people vote for the IRP.
The IRP managed Me seven decades until the presidency was lost in 2000.
She's preparing a return, and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in this trial.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Valecho, just a little, he's disappointed Calderon, who's headed the rating before the election day.
Calderon, candidate from the Partie of National Action, or PND, appointed by her brother, from recognizing Valleho as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, candidate from the Left Democracy of the Revolution Party, or DRP, who now belongs to the Governing chair, has come to the third-serious damage for the divided and ineffective left before the presidential elections of 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the results.
Valecho, an ex-master of the capital of Morel, refused to communicate with drug traffickers and invited other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoacan, there were long drug cartridges specialised on marihuana, heroin and metaphetamine.
This is the family of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch military oper against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence has continued until this morning.
The PND-mar was killed in a week before elections when he acted with Louise Maria Calderon, and several candidates were out of a pre-elective chain because of fear.
For the IRP, however, as the choices in Michoacan are terrible, the victory will give a movement impulse to the party.
A man who had to represent the IRP in the presidential round, Enrique Pen Nete, speaking from Washington, welcomed Valleho and said, "I think this victory must be very nice in the front of the year."
ABR convinces Asia to help save the zone
The Asian Development Bank committed India and China to be ready to help save the area from the Peeis crisis to avoid a long-term fall that would stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rasan Nag, director of the ABR office in Manile, said that two largest economics must " do all that they can" to restore the monetary block with the International Value Fund or the first double-country agreements.
He warned that BRIK countries look at the difficulties of the "inspeaking" countries and said that the Asian financial agency on the side of Peace leadership and resources could help to avoid long-term falling in the global economy.
"We're all scattering."
"This is why anybody who can help to get out of the crisis is useful," he reported Financial Times at an interview during the World Economic Force in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected at some point, but it can't be inevitable."
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The monetary union has been extremely deteriorated by the debt crisis in the past months.
In recent days, Italia’s business funds have grown threatening, and the Prime Ministers, both Italy and Greece, have gone away.
The developing in the long-term crisis caused fear that it could bring the world economy back to recession, and led to the invitations of leading developers to gather together to help the area find a decision.
Mr. Neg foretold that any Asian aid would be carried out through the IMF, but said that a bilateral cooperation — such as buying EU financial aid obligations — was a means to ensure financial stability -- provides great strength to the Asian partners’ negotiations.
Anand Charma, Minister of India's Trade Minister, said that "India will do all that it will" to help the area, since its own economy is now concerned with the reduction of exports and the reduction of the influences of foreign capitals.
"No one wants the zone to remain instable and calm," he said.
"We have great tasks, and we must support the high level of growth."
"It's not a option, it's a commitment, because we'll find for tens of millions of our girls and girls."
Others claim that there is no meaning for the development of an economy like India to help rich people when they are faced with their own deep economic problems.
Ashtosh Warshni, professor at the Brown University of the United States, said that it would be very difficult to provide assistance for billion Indians, of whom approximately 800 million dollars per day or less.
"In a moment, they will find out that the Greeks are going to a pension in 50 years and go to the sea festivals, and that will not be accepted well," he said.
Le Hovelle, director of the World Economic Force, also asked why the reservations of India should be used to contain the Greek and well-paid public sector's multi-compensed representatives in badly organized, delicate enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the crisis of the zone threatened the "significant consequences" throughout Asia.
The ABR ' s 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 has now occurred with "below risks" due to threats.
He said that the vulnerable developing markets need to be "made plans" to protect themselves from the fall and significant degrees of capital from their economy.
The Pentagon's terrible warnings on potential reductions of defence costs
The Defence Minister Leon Panetta urged the situation on Monday in the assembly by warning that the expected automatic reductions of the budget would disrupt national security and would cause a financial heavy reaction from the Pentagon Corridors to the fighting fields in Afghanistan and the Civil Assembly.
Pentagon has already been used to reduce $450 billion in the next decade, but it is now afraid that you add the reductions of $600 billion or more if the convention cannot reach the cost agreement.
"The consequences of these reductions will be disruptive for the Ministry," reported Panet in a letter to Senators of Rep John Cain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the non-congress of the convention to adopt a budget agreement and that the sequence so-called is initiating a total decrease of 23% and a number of new projects.
"This strong reduction that is so unrepentant will make most of our shipbuilding and building projects incomplete -- you can't buy three quarters of ships or ships -- and will cause a serious damage to other modernization attempts," wrote Panetta to Senators.
"We also have to be obliged to release many of our state architects and, since the reduction is so quick, we will almost have to release the state to achieve the objectives."
"These changes will cause the confidence of those who support the army and will cause a serious damage to the preparation."
The reductions at the end of the account will be cut off the military parts, said Panet.
"When military intervention in Foreign emergency operations is not affected by a stressed sequence, military achievements are severely suffering from serious disturbance in the main budgets," Panet warned.
"The contracting staff will be reduced to the end of the detailed contracts and the supervisory agreement which supports the army."
"A State staff will be decreased that will cause delays with military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated."
Two Senators wrote Panette 10 days ago and invited details of the consequences of automatic reductions in the Defence Minister.
"The Consequence of the Section in the Defence Minister will become a rapid fall of the United States as a leader of the World Warrior State."
"We are steadfastly opposed to these draconic actions," reported the Senators in a joint statement on Monday evening when they found the letter of Panetta.
"It's not the outcome we can live with, and it's not the outcome that we have to join."
"Sexvester is a threat to the national security of the United States, which allows it to happen."
Whether the letters of Panettas or the last warnings of Senators to the budgetary compromise will be introduced or will enhance the invitations to release Pentagon from decreases, see later.
Panetta was absolutely honest about the reductions, although he came to the Pentagon leadership after many years of the budget experts in the Congress and the White House and realized that he had a difficult choice.
At the press conference on the last week, the Defence Minister has drawn an unusual picture of what could be followed by the army with a cloud but without a nuclear.
"It's a ship without the mariners."
"It's a set of no pull."
"It's a flight wheel without enough pilots."
"This is the paper tiger, the army with catarms, convictions and bombs without sufficiently prepared soldiers who are able to carry out the mission," Panetta said in its introductive comments in Pentagon.
"This is the power that suffers from unusual fighting spirit, bad preparation and disaster to fight potential agamas."
"In fact, this promotes aggression."
In the annex to their letters to Cain and Graham Panet, the new details of how the reductions "see the meaning of operational risks: reactions to crisis, conflicts and disasters; seriously the possibility of being the first in spreading and reacting worldwide; and lead to unacceptable risks in future fight operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could face obstacles, including those who have been tested, and some at the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35, planned a new bomber, a balistic subwater ship of a new generation, a new warfare ship of the coastal zone and a new terrestrial fighting vehicle that Army and the Sea Pechote need to replace.
Suspending the further and testing of F35 may reduce $80 billion in 10 years, but its parties say that it is a vital step to comply with and oppose the potential threats of China and other opposers.
How to ly
The current view of the last titles shows the serious and global disappointment and lying in the entire life.
The candidate in the chairmans of Herman Cain's reprisonment of sexual accusations from several women; each of the parties is accused of liars.
The Penvania University Administration has been accused of false witnessing because they likely have hidden that a football trainer has violated the boys.
Last week, the President of France Nicole Sarkozy was captured when when the Microphone was involved, he told the President Barak Obama that the Prime Minister of Israel was a liar.
The lie breaks the career and has the country.
The New York Congressman and the Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Wayner, you are a fool, refusing your outcome that has been quickly rejected by an inappropriate evidence.
The former candidate in President John Edwards has been charged with an accusation of financial migrations during the campaign with the covering of alien relations.
And again, no one of those who lived at that time will never forget the media cycle with President Bill Clinton, who lies about his sexual relations with Monica Levinski during his second time on post.
The stories on school and college studies are a common thing.
There were occasions when the teacher gave the disciples answers to tests to have the outcome of their activities.
Teachers who have to teach the opposite have sent a message that falseness is acceptable.
How many lies do we lie?
You can lie from 10 to 200 times during one day.
Now it is supposed that a significant part of this is a lie in salvation.
Another study showed that strangers were lying three times in the first 10 minutes to meet each other.
It is necessary to find lies or to deny lies to every skill, both for similar and professional purposes.
In contrast to the commat game, like, the shoes in which to call "Fail!", the detection of a lie is a serious way of knowing the scientific data collected in the past six decades at the Prestigious Universities, which is undertaken by the full-term research projects, especially on psychology and physology.
One of the results of the investigation is that most of the old mines of lies have been divorced.
The liars look in their eyes.
They're not always tired, wounded, red or crazy.
It is not necessary to conclude that it is difficult to note and that it is difficult to disappoint.
A experienced liar spreader can reach the truth, watching the structure of the mimic, the structure of issues and temporary characteristics.
I have spent a few years by studying scientific openings in a broad and continuing segment of knowledge of lies, and clearly that the finding of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps to orientate in our complex world - especially if your professionals include recycling, interviews, negotiations or management.
Good lies are fully able to read others, making them feel unnecessary, controlling their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others appreciate them.
We know from the study that extraverses will be more frequent than introverts that men are more lying about themselves, while women are often to protect some feelings that married people will be less to their partners than unmarried (but the lie that they say, most often, are deceived).
We too know that if you are a liar, others will feel less guilty by liaring you.
How do you understand if someone lies?
First, watch the normal behaviour of your object.
This is called "determination of the original state".
This helps to ensure the sending point for changes.
Watch the voice, laughing, voice characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know whether a person is steadfastly striking in the normal condition, then you are not going to blame unfair accusations when you see the shooting of your feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for a group of false religious and unbelieving acts.
Remember these groups as red flags, not as a proof of falsehood.
The liars can fix the part of their body when they are trying to remember their history, they can put their steps towards the door, turn out, change their post in a certain way or demonstrate "easy after an interview" -- this excessive breath of facilitation and change of pockets when all complex issues are behind.
The investigators often fascinate the application signal to simply look at this facilitation after interview.
Take note of what your object is.
It is known that Scott Peterson has occurred and spyed the past time, acknowledging that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her searches throughout the country.
Convincing people may also take a distance in the matter: "I had no sex with this woman... Miss Levinski" or to repeat the complex issue completely.
The most typical beliefs of food indicators are captive.
Someone can use "kwal language" when he answers the complex question: "Hor...
This makes an answer more emotional than real, and often is a red flag.
There is no means to find lies, but it is possible to overcome the practice of discovery of falsehood.
These abilities will increase the opportunities for each to not become a victim of experienced juices in professional and personal life.
The opposite plan for the building of oil has to be revised after the threat of the United States to revoke its approval
A few days after the Omama administration has threatened the approved oil carrier from Canada to the Me Canadian Valley -- calling on anger of professionals, but relaxing the environmental protectors -- a company who is going to build oil carrier, claims that it will reexamine the project to restore it.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that it would have a planned oil carrier from the environmentally sensitive area of Pesce Holms in Nebraska and is sure that the project would still be approved.
The company made this decision on the press conference in the Nebraska capital.
The Official Representative of TransCanada Alex Purbas says that the company is confident that it finally will be approved for oil carrier, although with another road.
This happens after the statement of the State Department last week, that he will make a decision on the draft at the federal level until he studys new roads that are not affected by the Nebraska Mountains and the Aquapher of Ogala, the great underground water stock.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Le Terry, a repository from Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise ordered by the State Department will mostly refuse to make decisions before 2013, after elections in the year ' s, although the authorities refused that the policy had been interrupted.
Both, in the written statement last week, called a decision by the State Department, and expressed support to him.
The oilwater of 1.700 miles shall be spent from Canada to the Mean Canadian Valley.
He has to transfer 700,000 barrelas on the day from Albert's province to oil carriers in Texas.
To do this, he needs to cross six states.
It is hated by environmental protectors, but they love professionals who hope about 200,000 slaves with oil.
However, the Nebraska legislators who speak against the plan consider the draft law to have a movement from the District of Pesce Halls and Aquapher of Ogalala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current investigation of the State Department on Environment Effects showed that the project would only demonstrate a negative impact on the environment, but the energy source claimed that the Department's reviewer had offered an enormous expertise in the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is the lobbyist of the TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was adviser in the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, a conflict of interests for the program.
Another was the choice of a company that was taken to conduct an initial investigation that was inadequate, since it was with TransCanada.
Patty Label was sent to the court because she was as if she had called a child tough from fear.
The New York family claims that Patty Label's awesome disco started to bow up in their homes at Manhattan, fearing their little-year-old daughter to the extent that it was fearful.
Lady Marmalade's artist Tirada feared Geneva Monk 18 months so much that she had transferred "the change of person, the disgrace of dream" and "the fear of strange people," says her family in the High Court of Manhattan.
This occurred on 10 November last year when the slave scenes of Kevin Monk, his wife, the student of the garden, Rosanna, and Geneva were going to travel in the family.
While Kevin Monk was capturing a car, Rosanna Monk came down to the bowl of the Reverside Bowl with their baggage, he was carrying Geneva.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and dropped her daughter down in a minute.
"No one came back to me and said, "You know what your daughter does?" I said, "yes" and she went to take her," she said.
Label heartily made a complaint to a female.
"He aggressively said, "You shouldn't leave your daughter at the door," said Rosan Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you're talking or thinking."
She came into anger and began to use a wrath -- a word on C and a word on F -- on higher tons...
She had a bottle of water, and she started smoking water from a bottle on me.
She said Geneva had started an isteric.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
Label was thrown to her mother -- which still holded Geneva -- and her companions had to hold her and push her into the expecting car, said Rosan Monk.
The little girl weeped so much that she was stuck, she added.
Lately, the family sent a note with excuses, but did not answer.
Label's lawyer and representatives are not responsible for commentary calls.
The amount of compensation for the payment is not reported, but the family, C• Davis, said that it was taken freely for this and that the family planned to make any money that would be obtained, for the welfare of the disease cancer.
"The goal is to make Patty Label response for his actions," said Davis.
"This behaviour is completely inappropriate, especially by the teacher of the garden with a 18-month child in hand."
Climate problems have slowly affected the economy
During the first year of the Government of Mario Lopes in Sinaloa, the labour market grew up without a legal market, and the deterioration was reduced and the economy was weak.
The year 2011, which was in Sinaloa ' s economic history as the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Valdes, also called a year of change, which had brought great hopes for economic development, but in view of the unfortunate climate conditions of the year, the growth was not registered, but the decrease of the main economic development indicators was recorded.
The low temperatures of February led not only to the loss of millions for the agricultural sector, but they had the opportunity to increase the public economy by reducing the economic activity totally by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly by the story of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamic of other economic sectors.
According to the report of the areas, the suffering from the milk provided by the Council on sustainable rural development was 835.582 hectare, of which 78.03 per cent had been totally suffered, and the remaining 21.07 per cent had been partly suffered.
The economic activity declined until November, a continuous growth without a person in the State, according to the National Statistics and Geographic Institute, during the first three quarters, the growth of the level without a rate was fixed, from January to March 55.053 of Sinalo, with 4.53 per cent of the economic active population, in the second quarter, increased up to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September it continued to grow to 6.19 per cent, which is more than 74.000 people without the capacity of Sinalo, which is more than 18.969 people than the first half.
Decrease of liquidity
Without a single in Sinaloa, many factors have been discussed throughout the year, for the economy Gerard Lopez Servantes, Director of the Economy Faculty and Scientific University (UAS), a growth without a person can be explicitly explained by actions taken in the public policy.
"What we now see is a growth without a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market for the purpose of the resources imposed by the law adopted at the assembly to delay money, because people who have illegally owned dollars are not easy to work with them, invest and play them in something," he said.
Stopped immigration
Lopez Servantes said that there was a demographic factor in growth without a deficiency.
"The number of people who leave the states in the search for for borders were in the United States, in the first place because of the composition, and in the second, because, once they entered, they are already faced with a lot of difficulties in seeking work, so the group of people remains and requires slavery places here, in the state, as a result of a level without a job," he said.
Injury of the requirements
Sinaloa ' s work market analysis becomes worse if a large number of violations that have been overcome under the works conditions under INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the public ' s active population works without being able to be protected as a protective institution.
In addition to non-formation and distortions, another reminder of the state is presented lowerly; the lowest payments in the country, records of the Canadian Institute of Safety and the Ministry of Labour and Welfare.
The average monthly income of the Servants of Sinaloa was until September 5.352 pesce, very lower than the average country, which consists of 7.375 peases.
AIDS reduction
In addition to the fall of economic activity and a high share in 2011, the largest amount of foreign investments for the past 10 years, according to the Financial Ministry, was estimated at 630.697 dollars from July to July, which shows that 87.74 per cent is compared to 5.143.312 dollars during the same period last year.
On its own, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government of the State has a deficit of only 17.280,000 investments during the year, mainly in the service business.
Long
At the background of the economic fall, the Government of the State requested in July the approving of the credit for 3 billion feeds, which would have been provided for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to survive the economy, only 2.600 million pesos were approved, and no benefits were expected until November in the state's economic sector.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario Lopes Valdes, the deficit of the Government is demonstrated.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, president of the National Palace of Industrial Trade, said that in 2011 the desires of various sectors were not sufficient, including the Government of the State.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa in this year was really low, it must be a lot of work to return the positions lost in this year, in 2012 we must double our efforts, we have not been able to make all efforts and, in particular, the good and synchronized new government team, we hope that the year will be much better," he said.
Economy Slowness
Lopez Loredo said that such events, such as early frozens, have stopped the state economy and its efficiency and growth in this year.
"The lack of economy I'm being the result of several events, including the breast, one of the main effects was a slow economy, which does not become quick enough to create a dynamic that allows us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, we close it below our expectations at the end of the year," he said.
Review of direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Conference of Roboters Me’kanian Resp in Sinaloa, said that the State should continue the most dynamic productivity.
"In general, we have found that we worked on this, we believe that it is necessary for a long-term programme to re-determine the direction and the economic course of the State to identify all the materials and resources of Sinalo," he said.
Present work
The President Coparmex stressed the importance of definition of the future direction in order to improve Government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to succeed in various areas, in terms of economic development, there is a little progress, but it is important for a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration was a demonstrator of progress in its own way of leading public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to tell us that the Government begins to be involved in and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government will realize that much more is to do," he said.
He was sentenced for 8 kg of marihuana
Five years of income and straf in 100 days - such a sentence was issued to the citizen Navolato for eight kilograms of marihuana.
The prosecutor-General reported that the convicted drug trafficker, Omar Ales Valensuéla Sandual, was condemned for a crime against health, in this case the conservation of the marihuana is for the purpose of spreading.
According to the case AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valensuéla Sandval was arrested by Canadian military forces on 7 June 2010 in carrying out the street of Cyprus Valdes, before 80 earlier in El Castilo, Navolato.
The drug trader was a white car, a picape in which he was carrying a black bottle in the car box, and at the passenger seat, a small rubber, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For these reasons, the exception was submitted to the Second Court of Auditors, and the accused continues to be captured in the Centre for the Support of Legal Consequences of Crime.
It is necessary to contribute to work
Common works relating to programmes such as the Rodin, the Saving of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are risked to remain incomplete or too delayed because of the lack of funds, said Miguel Anhel Lopez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Development indicated that, despite the development of work programmes, they are in danger, because the Government of the State is not able to make appropriate contributions, which constitute an amount exceeding 11 million peso for all three programmes.
He noted that all three programmes generally constituted approximately 50 million pesos, from which the State must have 25 per cent, and that only the Federation and the Municipality were ensuring resources for work, thus still a delay with their end.
"They must put nearly 12 million, and even though the year ends, they didn't give us any coppers when they had to give us a part from beginning of July," he said, "in order to not put up, we started work and they were very moved, but we needed money."
He mentioned that during the past year, during the rulership of Jesus Agilar Padilla, the State did not make the contributions he had to be made, so at the beginning of the government of Municipality it had to take money to cover more than 7 million, which was not provided by the State administration in that case.
"This happened to us in the previous administration because the State had no financial initiatives to participate, but the programmes continued to develop, and this year to access these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what the State has left," he explained.
Although the State authorities have the obligation to provide these resources, he states that the request has been made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that the percentages related to them have come as soon as possible.
"They have to bring nearly 12 million, and even though it ends a year, they haven't given us any shoes."
The Court will approve "the transition to digital television" in Me'ka in 2015
The replacement of analogues to digital signals is one of the most important changes that have reached the world in the past years.
The Supreme Court of Justice rejected the constitutional claims issued by the Senate and the Palestinian representatives against the presidential decree, which transfers the so-called " transition to digital television" from 2021 to 2015, since no eight votes were recorded for its cancellation.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court of Justice, Juan Silvua, considered that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded its powers by providing a decree with a detailed description of the transmission to digital television.
As a result, the constitutional claims declared by the Senate have been rejected in the absence of a qualified majority of eight votes necessary for the court to make the constitution or non-constitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by the Minister Olgoy Sanchez Cordero was to declare a decree inconstitutive because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a law established by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) in violation of the principles of irrespective subordination and reserve law.
Only Salvador, Horhe Mario Pardo, Margarith Luna and Sanchez Cordero vote for a project.
According to this argument and Senate, the Deputats and the Council held two constitutional negotiations to deal with decree and support complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero stopped the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it to the digital meeting.
At the meeting of the Ministers, it was also decided to reject the request of the Deputats Palace without discussing the project and also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his case, the Prime Minister said that he was not able to have the arguments of the project in the meaning that the federal executive authority could not determine the common rules for the public administration to prepare.
"I don't also think that if this happens, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and that the planning of public policies in the fields of telecommunications, such as the telecommunications sector, has regard to the federal executive authority with the constitutional mandate, the Government of the State.
The replacement of analogues to digital signals is one of the most important changes that have occurred in the past years led to the best use of the radio-electric, the best quality of the signal and more channels.
The reporting of the transition, he said, would mean to replace the benefit of converting into a digital form, which includes the satisfaction of public needs not only in technical dimensions, "which covers economic, strict, political and national security issues."
These issues, he said, "need the work of the whole system under the principle of the public economic administration, includes a group of authorities that the Constitution units into the public executive authority."
He concluded that a large number of countries worldwide had already completed the transition to the digital meeting, and did it with the executive authority, despite the presence of technical institutions.
In this regard, the Government concluded that by adopting a decree discussed, which, in any case, affects the competence of the Congress, in the administrative field, to ensure compliance with the laws adopted by the Act of the Assembly.
In Michoacan, the " vote by vote" can be analyzed.
According to the data submitted to the PRC, the difference between the first and the second place in the Government elections consists of only 27 per cent, even without the summary of the votes coming from 879 from the total number of 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of calculation of " vote by voice" is that the process of elections in Michoacan in this year, where the difference between the first and second place in the Governing elections is only 27 per cent, even without a summary of the 879 votes from the total number of 6.074 protocols.
In the light of this chairman of the Institute of Elections of Michoacan (HIV), Maria de Los Anhles Lyanderal Saragos, the electoral boat adopted a package of principles to guard the rules of the Federal Electoral Reform for several days ago, 9 November.
As it should be said, Michoacan did not adopt the Constitution or the Election Code of the State or the Electional Code of the Electoral Right, since the State Congress approved reforms as soon as the legal period of entry into force in this electoral process, and the Governor Leonel Year Rangel did not include it in the terms set out in the Official Journal of the State, as stated that he had some expressions.
On the same day, on 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (EUEU) made a decision on the constitutional claim issued by the law of the assembly, and called the "ineffective and illegal" voice of the representative of the State on Constitutional Reform, since he had no right to "resolute or support them".
In the interview of the " vote by" Mary de l'Angeles Lyanderal, the adoption of the appropriate principles by the IWM Council would be a part or complete summary of the votes by the electoral authority.
Thus, a part of the calculation of one or more elections can be produced under conditions that: the results of the protocols are not corresponding; no voting protocol and accounting of the documents in the furnace or is not located by the President; or when there are evidence errors or corrections in the Protocol.
Furthermore, the general summary of votes in all votes on elections may take place when there is a distinction between the prosecutor's prosecutor and those who have received the second place in voting, less than one per cent, while the request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition that you are the second of the candidates.
The general review of the votes will also be made if at the end of the ordinary account it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place is less than one percent, while there is a request from the political party whose candidate has taken the second place, where the election of the urnes is excluded in the part of the review.
It is important to note that there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PRC, only 0.16 per cent of the first and second place, not even 129 votes from the total number of 923 protocols.

The new Italian Government will be established in the middle of
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet the President of Italy tomorrow to meet the new Government that faces the crisis that sets this country at the front of the economic disaster.
The Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet in the middle of the president of Italy in order to meet the new Government that faces the crisis that Italy has established in the middle of the economic disaster and the damage of the whole area.
The statement from the presidential court stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet in the middle of the president George Napolitano to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that he will have the office of the main technocrats, although it is unrecognized when the new executive authority will take its positions.
Monty said that he would reply to the President the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form the Government.
"I want to confirm my full confidence in the ability of our country to choose from this difficult period," said the former reporter Commissioner.
Monty didn't directly say that he had to form the Government, but the tonne of his comments showed that the obstacles were overcome.
"Structure is now well decorated," he said.
Monty completed the government's forming process less than three days, much less than usual, since Italy had committed political and financial crisis which had resulted in their size at a critical level
The Administration under the former Commissioner Monty must approve the package of the hard economy required by the leaders of Peace to return trust to Italy.
On the basis of the pressure on Monty to make it quick, the markets have set up income from the BTP obligations of Italy for 10 years, more than 7 per cent, at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Markegalia, leader of the Italian Roboters Federation, reporters after meeting with Monty: "We said we would be actively supporting this Government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity of Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances were successfully supported by the LDP Party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to leave on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said reporter Angelino Alphano, Secretary of the Central and Right Party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because many of its members are currently opposed to the government majority of Monty's technologies.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty must have a strong Parliamentary support for reforms which will probably be a cruel economy.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts may lead to a new and disruptive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has increased pressure by warning that Monty ' s disaster may be a disaster.
Monty began consultations with political parties, unions and business groups on Monday, as well as with young and female parties.
He's finishing his meetings on Tuesday evening.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, who allowed a very fast transition to respond to the crisis.
After a short transfer last week, when it was clear that the Berlucone wy's debt price of Italy has now reached a critical level at the background of uncertainty is whether the new Prime Minister will be successful.
It would have been too much for modern financial protectionists of the zone to save Italy with a public debt at 1.8 billion.
Monty said that his Government would be able to guard before the elections appointed for 2013, despite the spread predicts that politics would only give him time to reform before setting up new elections.
Monty said that he wanted to include policies in his office, but the main parties insisted that it should be composed only from technical experts, the testimony of their deficiency by the effects of the financial situation.
Political sources reported that mutual uncertainty and non-parties are complicated to endeavor to include political figures.
Spanish playing experiences are more than Ticos
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, ten had already played 50 feet.
Only one of the 22 stated players from Costa Rica played 50 cats.
A little contrast with Costa Rica, compared with 22 players sent by both countries to the companionship gate today at 3:05 day at the National Stadium in San Hose.
While the world campaigns and they are, the number one in the monthly FIFA rating, has a full list of class A selection games, Tricolora only has a protector of Michael Uman as the only one who has performed 50% of the games.
This number was held last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), at the stadium of Romel Fernandes.
Spanish footballists playing in the League of all stars and in the blue English Premier Liga Clubs have been very active during this year in the ligue and in cubic constructions, and they are high-level players in the Cubes and the Champions Lige.
It should be added to the experience of Spanish fury in a complex degree of the world's terms or Championates.
The Ticos players, however, have been experienced in the kind of KONKAF, which is considered the lowest level of FIFA.
We see that the list is listed in the Spanish collective folks Iker Ka'as, who last Sunday repeated the record of the ex-holkiper Andony Subisaret, with 126 matches, against England (maths lost 0-1 in London).
Ca’as is playing against Tricolora today and will set a new record in 127 of Spain's catches.
Havi Ernandes, the player of Barcellona, is 106 bitches.
Ca'as and Havi were recognised as the best last week with the other player of the Iberian team, Subisaret, with 126 bottles and a bombarder of Shalke Raulam Gonsales with 102.
It's almost close to a hundred Carles Poyol with 97 games.
Havi Alonso followed them from 91, Fernando Torres, from 90, David Willa and Serhio Ramos, both of 81, Andres Innesta, 62, Sesk Fabregas, 61, and David Silva, 53.
On the side of Costa Rica near Michael Umana, the left side of Hunior Dias with 48 bags and the bombarder Brian Ruis from 45.
Furthermore, only five roofed in 30 games: Caylor Navas from 31, Rendal Asofeifa from 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Ernandes from 36 and Hose Louis Lopes from 35.
Leave it.
More than 30 cats in Spain at Gerar Pike (37), Serchio Busquets (36), Santa Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
In a collection of less than 30 outputs on the field, there is Roy Miller with 26 bags, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla from 25 and Roy Murry from 23.
The rest did not even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four, and the games with Hordy Alba are two, Victor Bolivar only one, Olman Wargas and Nelson Edder are still not born.
The leader of Spain David Willa with 50 footballs followed by Fernando Torres from 27.
For Costa Rica Brian Ruis, those who offered more shoes twice more than Carlos Ernandes and three times more than Roy Murry and Parks.
Quentet included the country in tour for twenty years of career
The driving in Costa Rica is the outcome.
In an exclusive interview of Viva based Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam, the group was ready to give one of the best concerts on Sunday at the National Stadium.
There were more than 20 years of expectation, but the group says that it is also a famine that makes reality to play in this country.
It was with the basic and founder, Jeff Amant, who was an exclusive interview of Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located in the South America territory for 20 years of work and on Sunday, 20 numbers, will make its only residence in Central America.
On that day, they will speak at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 dinner, together with the Los Angeles The X team and the group Las Robertas.
This is a broadcast of the conversation that is full of decryption available online in The Nation.
For your fans from Costa Rica, it's the past trial that Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica? Do you know what your fans are experienced?
The road in Costa Rica is the past morning, and for us too.
This is only our second visit in South and Central America, and even well.
I was in Costa Rica only once - in the department, it's a beautiful country, and I think we'll be able to stay there for a few days.
That is why we are very happy to bring our home there.
I am asking this because there is some loyalty to the group; the employees will be stressed in days before the concert.
What will you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
We needed almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that we needed so much time to get here.
People, waiting for your concert, refer to him as the greatest year show.
Does this add a little stress to your visit?
Of the biggest show we played in the last 21 years, we have been in the last two weeks.
We conducted a few wonderful shows in San Paulo and hoped that it brought us into a form for this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we really want to play here.
We love this country, we love to work with serfining and jungles, that is cossing these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her whales for serfing?
We have many serphers friends, and I have a good friend living in Tamarinda, and the whales are incredible here.
My friends are always easier to work as a serving in Costa Rica and Ni'gua, as well as in Me'ku, these are excellent places for serphing, as we have learned about this, from people who love serphing.
Looking at the tour, you can say you did a great show with a song.
What are you planned to speak in Costa Rica?
Since we never played there before, we have no idea what we can do.
We're trying to make a better show of the most different songs; we're trying to play a few songs from each album and make our fans a great variety of recorders.
You never repeat the recorder.
How do you do that?
I think it is partly because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's difficult to choose what songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it's holding us in a tone, and it's going to hurt us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and what we could forget.
This makes a show more interesting for us, and I think it makes it more interesting for people.
This tour is 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it difficult to believe in everything you've done?
Yeah, of course.
First, I think no one of us could never believe that we were in the rock group and that we're doing this over 20 years makes it like a lamentation.
We are happy with our happiness and we are very encouraging that we can continue to create a building together.
We all love each other, and we love creating one another.
We are happy to go through the places in the world where we always wanted to go.
Everything is very successful for us.
What does it mean to be a significant part of the grain flower?
It was always the honour to be part of this group of large collectives.
We're good friends with boys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's nice when the movement grows from a group of friends, and it's unusual.
Since time, one group of one town appears, but much more strange when five or ten groups appear at one time in one town.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
I'm still playing with some of them for a while.
Last year, we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we are happy to be friends with them all and for us to be part of Sietla's sound that got.
It is also very strange that your group remains together and in the same time is so long.
Yes, four of us were 21 years together, and the Me (Cameroon) joined us 13 years ago, which is very longer than many groups.
First, I think we're lucky that we're still alive, and second, we'll take care of others.
We are all very close friends, and we were also opened by the ways that give each experiment freedom.
We trust each other, and it couldn't be better.
Your attitude to the word of glory was simple; but through your success you have been able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
When we grew up, it became more likely to find the balance.
We will take care of not too long in tour because it is easy to enter this game of big crowds and people who love your life.
Until you remember that people here for their sake, it reminds you that you must respect and that you have done it without determining to be famous and rock stars, what no one of us will forget.
What do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs, and at the beginning it was great.
We were a group of almost three years, and we did not release any albums until Andrew Woods died.
It was very disappointed because it was so long, and the most important thing that we were close friends with Bruce (Fervezer) and Greg (Gilmore), who started with us in the group, and when I heard a song or a picture, I think of an incredible man who was Andy, and how he made me ridicule, it was always the pleasure to go, laugh, talk about and football and a lot of others.
It was a wonderful man, and we're crazy about him.
The local group of Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her, especially Eddie Vedder, and so you chose her to open it?
Yes, the manufacturers sent us a few video proposals, and this was a group that loved us more than all, so we don't have to see that Las Robertas could offer a lifetime, and this must be very embarrassing.
Why are you always changing the words in Yellow Ledbetter on concerts?
This is the question to Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He's sing it and I think he's using the first thing he's coming in.
Who affected you as a bassist?
So much of them.
Among the first who come to mind, Gizer Batler, John Antvisle, Si Jay Ramon, John Dou, Paul Cartney, Chuck Dukovski...
They're so much that I can talk all day about the bases I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the accuracy of the grange, despite he's no longer in mode?
I think we all feel some disappointment from the word of grange.
When I think of him, he reminds me of the groups I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who appear at the same time, and if this is important now, I think it's wonderful, because it's the one you should hear, and the teams like Mudhoney now create better than ever.
In the beginning, your life was more darker, and now it became more darker.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there's a few songs in the album that can look more like it, but there's songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are considered very dark, even though they can sound a little.
From both, when Ed played them, I wept when I listened to them, these songs are very dark.
I think when you're going to have some trauma in your life and you've lost a family member or a friend, these events begin to affect your creation and your life, and these two songs, of course, reflect it to me.
I think you can be a happy person and still know to create a darkness.

Super Mario warned more than 25 years to save Princess Pich from Bouser's bad lap, but never before he did this in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for love in the stereoscope technology.
From the worldwide stores this month, the Nintendo 3DS portable console has been created, which allows playing in three dimensions without the need of use of signs.

Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo, especially played under this form", since successful products like Star Fox 64 3D or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adjusting games.
The representative Nintendo stated that, despite 3D performance, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and underlying game.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part of "soft" to be less experienced users.
One beginning, most of the experts are playing at the second round of the games that are more complex this time.
Moreover, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or those who only affect the depth of action, but who must be played in three dimensions to overcome different obstacles and "no offense to optical illusions".
This invasion of Super Mario in three dimensions also refers to the return of the hero to the Portative Console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo puts up the serial fans and repeats the successful formula from the previous games, the water manager with the mouths needs to go through a dangerous migration to free Princess Pich.
However, the player will find new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the "player" Louise.
It guarantees the extradition of Portillo in the United States
President Alvaro Colome said on Tuesday that the process of extradition of Alfonso Portillo started to respond in the United States for the charge of 70 million dollars.
This is the end of the process that Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country required for the issue of Portillo to judge it there.
At the press conference, Col said that his decision was independent of the judicial and executive authority, taking into account that the court of the first institution had already signed an extradition.
He acknowledged that during his mandate he did not " impose hands" on legal decisions and adopted all procedures for extraditions that he had ever known.
However, Portillo Serchio Ruano Marrokin will be extracted for murder and severe physical damage, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Parades, both for drugs.
What has been done by the Column shows an executive process after all legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted in order to persecute the ex-head of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Court of Auditors and the Constitutional Court (CS), Portugal will be extracted once with a decision on its legal position in Guatemala and the guarantee of human rights.
Portillo was recognised as innocent in the expenses of Q120 million in the Defence Ministry during the Presidency, which was a process in the preceding extradition, but the Ministry of Public Ask and opened the case again.
Trinijova has helped 6.000 young people from the risk group
Organization was created to prevent marginalism of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the Trinijova Support Organization: 6.000 young people under isolation have helped to overcome difficult situations during this fourth century.
This should be added to more than hundreds of slaves created for the group.
The anniversary served as conduct for the results of the ceremonie conducted in the fabra I Coats site, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijova was able to light near the Villa Trinity in 1986 in order to help young people with lack of education, lack of drugs or marginalisation.
The yesterday celebration in San Andreu has gathered a large number of responsible organizations and agencies cooperating with the association during these 25 years.
Different political representation during elections showed the unique nature of the work made by Trinijov.
After the President of Generality, Arthur Mass and his president Hordy Puhol, the ceremonie had visited the ex-consult of educational socialist Ernest Margal, and the ex-leavenant of the Meer and the current eco-socialist, member of the Municipal Council of Richard Goma.
Fabra I Coats has also been presented by the current adviser on the issues of well-being and family, Hosep Lewis Clarice and SEC on La Ca, Haume Lanasp.
He said that Trinijov had appeared in a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but he added that the work done before this pool "is a good basis".
The chairman brought Trinijov as an example of the fight against bad circumstances and the universe of hope in people who experience difficulties.
"The crisis is not new for its organization and work," he said.
Evacuated from where mass feasts were organized
Ockup captives are 11 of the 13 stages of the Balmes Street, 51
12 Occupants left from yesterday to midnight without fighting
It seems that the coshmar, the survived neighbors in the house 51 on the Balmes Street, ended.
Twelve people volunteerly left from which they were illegally occupied yesterday and where they organized massive festivals that violated the neighbors, in decision of the court without interfering with the police.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation.
"From this moment there will be a transitional control," said the manager.
Square who took 11 of the 13 stages of view, remained inhabited, all electricity and part of water, broke walls and left tracks of different kinds, especially banks under alcohol drinks.
The first three stages were a floor for mass feasts that spent until two days and disappointed the owners.
There is a night club, Balmes 51, who has also been harmful.
The Government, Maria Pantinata, reported Europe Press that since it was occupied, its income was decreased by 80%.
The Government of the Club states that the contemporaries were injustifying it, since they sold drinks for three, while in the club for ten.
Furthermore, the ownership of the discothetics had to respond to the complaints of neighbors to the sound, although, as she noted, the sound was called by non-club visitors, but by the inhabitants of the divorce, and, in particular, those who visited the festivals that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which were grown, as told by the disappointed neighbors.
The lady of the club said that the disapprovals were so large that she had even reached agreements with the owner of the owner, and that she had been "forgiving" her the payment of the rent for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that in the last weeks there were more complaints from the neighbors to the situation.
The President of the Municipal Group of PP, adviser Alberto Fernando Dias, needed to "evacuate immediately from" last week to resolve the problems of conciliation and the general spirit of neighbors and degree in this area.
Pope's leader explained that only one stage of comments had been taken before the summer, but in the past few months, the squadters were involved in all stages and approximately in each place and that some of them had occurred.
In this regard, he added that "the end of unjustice and the persistent opposing the uncleanness created in the opinion."
Evacu police members were from New Barris yesterday.
At 15:30, the police went out to Montreal Street, 35 after receiving a call from the neighbor who noticed four people were entered in.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects are able to compete after the contribution claims
The municipal competition on 16 doors repeated the debates on the role of the Colserola in Barcelona
In the middle of the 80th, at the end of the current Barcelona Staff Corporation (CCP), this administration printed a broadcast for Colserola.
The bucket described the mountain as a large park of Barcelona's stone.
Moreover, this was compared to pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CCB, in 1987, the park was again aware of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few who were not oriented north-south, but the top (bound) below (sea).
Colonel position as a natural park contrary to this idea.
It was not the Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild cabán in the role of Yoga.
It was so until in September the Council announced great complaints of 16 competitors at other ports in Colserolu.
Under the gate, the idea of the park is understanding, of course.
Or anybody wants to put the door on the field.
The question is one, Colonel, a park or a mountain?
Contributions, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are the subject of discussion of all Barcelone enacters.
Is it not the most repeated topic that is discussed when two members of this class of chosen people are familiar with each other in the lift?
And this is exactly one of the few coincidences between the three Barcelona Identifiers and the scientists present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modelo and Mara Bayon: with adequate
For Roldan, after reaching the rubber line, it becomes "necessary" to discuss "the previous side of the mountain", when the proposal of Eldephon Serda, the mountain with green eggs, was not discussed.
"We need to admit that the biggest Barcelone Park is a beach.
Furthermore, thanks to his accessibility.
"Colserola is more complex," says the Identifier, "which is "the door of the Colserola": we should not think of them "as the income of the park, but as some areas where we should guard."
The model, like Roldan and Bayon with experience in urban building, called "intelligent tasks" with "certain dangers".
The risks resulting in "indetermined prognoses of public space" after the 80th experience, which ended on Fora's "single song" area.
The first fear is the own border where you can build.
"The limitation of something is the preparation of a step," it means transition.
"We must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current [which is covered by the General Staff Plan (G)] can lead to real disaster."
Nearer than the case, Model believes that the simplification of the Colserol valley can be considered as a park, Barcelona, and not as a pure topographic issue.
The model recalls that there is already a job made by Calserola, which "not should be missing the ears," although it is grateful for the opportunity that Mary will have his profession to enter into this project "after the beginning".
Moreover, it understands that the nearby of the mountain to the city is a passport that allows the detectors to enter into debates, but "He doubts" is whether this technical profile is the means of conducting the interdisciplinary teams ("hearts", he approves), which had to be created: "Architects must be only a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that is called this part is complicated, since the rules of the concurrence are not enough for the general type of Colserola: "16 cross-sections have been declared," he says, "in the meaning of the sea-berg, but there is no longer reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This requires at least 16 concurrences.
On the other hand, the project for one gate can be crossed through the programme and definition of the project of the Identifier for Neighbourhood Gates.
From your point of view, the Council has to ensure that the road directly over Ronda de Dalt should ensure its full area that is equipped to create a floor cross between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrassabal and he will be released.
After 72 days of resolution, the Court Representative of Red Casino forgave Mr. Monterrey's brother in the proceeding against him in charge.
After 72 days carried out in the House, Manuel Jonas Larrassabal will be released after the Legal Representative of Red Casino gave him a excuse before the Second Court of Assembly, which is the process of complaint against Mr. Monterrey's brother.
After the Casino Royale bomb, the owner of Red Casino, Serhio Gil Garcia, repeated a series of graphs and videos where Manuel Jonas had to pay his economic contribution to allow Monterrey's authorities to allow a secret oper at the ice house.
After the public sentence, the State prosecutor opened the voting case against the brother of the Measurer and was arrested and sealed for 30 days on 2 September.
After four hours before the Minister of State of Crime on Heritage, he was sent to the timely placed in the ancient capital of the State.
In this respect, he remained 49 days following the provisions of the second statement of the prohibition of movement after the prosecutor had excluded crimes and organized crimes.
On October 19, he was transferred to Caderate as if a halfmillion peso were required by the owner of Red Casino, but he had only spent a few hours in the middle of the isolation of prisoners because he was threatened to death.
The authorities allowed him to continue in the municipality in San Nicolas in Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest was issued by the Secretary of the Second Court of Assembly, Horque Janes, who said that after nearly two months, there was sufficient evidence of Jonas ' guilt, such as 1.5 million peso with bookmaker representatives in exchange for operational authorisation.
On Monday, the Legal Representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Homes, presented before Judge Hose Louis Pessino to request thanks for the brother of the Measure of the region, so he could receive freedom in time.
During the trial, the State prosecutor, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomes, whether he had renounced the damage and who of the player's partners would be grateful, although he was still trying to avoid the name.
On the basis of records 197/2011, the legal gratitude was granted to Jonas Larrassabal, and then did not make any statements on the conduct of the process planned against it; no refund of damage and penalty would be required.
After listening to the legal representative of the bookmeckers, nearly at 15:50, it was ordered to release Larrassabal Breton immediately.
The Court of Justice, Horhe Janes, went to the Municipality of San Nicolas in Garza to announce Jonah that he was legally free and that his case would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate statement of the release signed by the judge.
The Minister of Dionisio Press Hacome relates to the details of disasters in which the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Francesco Blake, and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results obtained in an accident that the Ministry of Internal Affairs of France Blake Mora and seven other people had shown that the wheel had been hit directly on the ground in full integrity, without trying to produce a accident.
During the press conference, the Ministry of Relations and Transport, Dianisio Press Hacome said that before the aircraft was raised up, the pilot found that the conditions were appropriate for the flight.
"The elements that have been acquired by a number of contacts with the land have been contacted with the trees at 25 feet, where the means has lost flashing."
He also reported that the ship was designed for 19 persons, respectively, in accordance with the requirements for human transport.
He also said that the investigations carried out in the area of the attack were not reported about the presence of parts on the earth.
"The investigation reports that there are no components of the ship in other parts, and that a struggle of integrity has occurred.
"Vertolet was designed for 19 passengers, which satisfied the relevant requirements for passenger transport.
The earth in this area has a decline from seven to 30 degrees.
At that point, the Secretary said, mainly, to get the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation may take a few months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Mayer, Director-General of Airports and Assistent Services, said that the president's hostel was running on the cross-speed speed and that was happening on a slightly high-leaving ground during the attack.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of the usual summer manner at the time of hit," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Press Hakome, recalled six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the aircraft rules, the aircraft was held under the rules of the visual flight, which means that the team should be visible during the flight and landing.
Conditional conditions:
The AICM reports found appropriate conditions for the emission when the aircraft was moved to the border territory between Mexico and Meica State, where the layers of clouds were observed at lower heights.
Selected paths:
The team may have been looking for a smaller height area and more visible in the valley of Kuernawak.
A place of hit.
The coordinates of the attack and the last records of the aircraft are probably not lost of control or change in the direction of the aircraft before the attack.
Small floor dilution:
The information available to this puzzle indicates that the attack has come on the front and side line.
The dilution of caves makes it clear that the hothole has covered the land under a structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosions found:
Catastrophes remain in the area of unrecognized evidence of the ship’s surfaces, some kind of explosion or fire.
Results of the recent studies have shown that there could be private contacts with the land.
During the work, the aircraft was found at a height of 9.200 feet above the sea level, and the land is declined from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show that the results of it were disrupted on the road.
It contains facts that, as a result, the hothole could have had a few faces with the earth.
After a higher survey in a larger territory than the determined area near the place where the disaster had occurred, there were no diluted parts of the aircraft, which strengthened the assumption that the attack had occurred under the conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces a gene-search program
Social protection is an investigation on the search for gene disorder in children and young people; it is supported by INN experts
The Canadian Protection Institute (MSSI) announced me that it was conducting an investigation in order to detect the gene of kids and young people's genus, which had been called the Protocol " The Genetic Feeding in Evolution and Age", which would provide a summary of the signs of exhaust weight.
In its statement, the Chapter of Medical Medical Research Department of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the XXIth century, Miguel Crus Lopes explained that a multiprofit team from therapeutes, nurses, dietologists and farmers was gathered.
The Team is assisted by experts and aspirants of the National National Health Institute (NIPH) and the Centre for Scientific and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Political Institute (NPI).
The population (recorded or not) is invited to participate in the investigation centres of MSSI to the valley of Mexico, where each Sabbath will be tested at 8:00 a.m. in the morning.
He emphasized that the report was started in the centre of Kuautomoke (on the west of Mexico) and that from 8 October, the activities passed in the center of Nesualkotole (east of Mexico).
After the goal of 500 to 600 children, the investigation will continue in the South Mexico center of independence and, finally, in the Centre of Morelos (North Mexico).
He explained that the goal of this study was to understand genetic development and to establish a risk factor between children and young people to warn chronic degenerative diseases
On 14 November, the World Day of Peace with Diabetes will be noted, and the main goal is to gather three thousand children and adults from 6 to 14 years of age from the authorisation of parents and under their supervision for the completion of individual food laws.
They will also ask for the activity and the history of family heritage diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or initial insufficiency.
He explained that the anti-metrical measurements of all participants (weight, growth and volume of Talia), blood pressure measurement and levels of glucose, animals, cholesterine and insulin and genetical analysis will be carried out on the Sabbath (to detect genes that are ≥ ≥ xyre).
Cross Lopes said that this investigation reflects the concern of health specialists on the conduct of anxious weight increase among children.
In medical studies conducted from 1999 to 2006, it states that in only 6 years of growth, 77 per cent of boys suffered in the case of the girls, 47 per cent, and that the weight of the weight was also observed," said the MSSI specialist.
He said that the foundation of the markers' search is that the population of the country is different from other peoples on its genetic history.
He concluded that in the middle of the Indian descendants of the American Indians, 30 per cent of the descendants of the African descendants and five percent of the African descendants, and that reflected genes with diabetes and exhaust weight.
He explained that the genetic consequence of breathing is primarily the insufficiency of the body to burn the energy profits we consume (calories), and it is reflected in the form of grass.
The studies explained that the direct benefit for participants was a comprehensive number of children, which could find whether they had a degree of weight or wheat.
Even, he said, the presence of dark legs on the neck (agents) and before them means the probability of injury of metabolism and even predabeth.
With the whole confidentiality, the doctor before it is written to parents, which they explain all measurements and changes in the form of life that must be taken to avoid diseases.
Cross Lopes explained that there are three main reasons for providing the weight of residual weight, breathing and other chronic diseases: a seating of life, or a lack of daily activity, a greater part of the day before the television and transport at small distances rather than to go through the foot.
This is also because of high consumption of calories, which also increases the use of sweet drinks and u′waters (broad, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with greater content of animals and proteins and genetic predictions analysed in this programme.
The UNAM Asfalt will be able to avoid the dishes
Raphael Errera, studies of the UNAM's chim faculty, had times a polymer-modified bit to produce a mixture of the best quality that is sustainable to the environment and temperature.
If the signals sent by the road cover were noted, it would be necessary to repair about 200 000 yam for each rain season in the valley of Mexican continent, Rafael Errera Naher, the UNAM's him-faculty studies, and adds that if the construction process and the content of the asfaltted road cover is regulated, the amount of feed can be reduced or totally set to zero.
In his lecture, the Technological view of the chemical frame read in the International Year of Chemistry reports that the laboratory for which it is responsible develops a polymer-modified bitume for the production of mixtures close to the bitume, but with the best opposite both in high and low temperatures.
Errera Naher said that this type of modified bits could be used in places where the weather is extremely crazy, as in some cities in the north to improve the quality of the road and thus the opposition to food education.
He explained that the bitume, the weightest part of the oil is the results of the molecule in the waterwood, some are the high molecule of the mass called asfalten, and others are the low molecule of the mass of maleten, which together cover the road covering of its character binding behaviour.
The ambiguous behavior of bits is that at a high temperature of approximately 180 degrees he is like height, at 120 degrees height, and at 50 degrees in Celsius he keeps almost strong with, while in very low temperatures, the bitum becomes cruel, he said.
This means that the opposition to the street asfalt is not continuous, but is changed during the day, depending on natural and temperature, said the chim engineering specialist.
The scientist chimfaca noted that the streets of Mexico were mainly covered by a deep cover, consisting of six layers of material, of which three recently included bitum.
Among the most layers, the bitum consists of small stones left in the bit and then pressed.
Each stone that makes this cover, he said, it's in a bit.
In the movement of vehicles and in the example of efforts, this helps the powers to deal very well with road covering.
If this was a modified asfalt, they would be better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
On the asfalt cover, he added the last layer, which is called the layers of exports made of a small stone, actually the sand that is also covered in asfalt.
Since this layers will contact transport wheels, it must have more opposite than asfalt covering and ensuring a road train.
As part of the road coverage that will receive and distribute the efforts, the export layer also requires the appropriate length, and it is necessary to take into account the material from which it is produced.
Weather, especially heat and temperature overlaps, is also important to consider, especially water, because it is significantly affected by asfalt.
When the land is soiled, water is covered and it is difficult to get out of there, it causes all the levels of covering and thus eating education.
In the training of food, he said that the first layer of export was exhausted and only then it affected the bit, but the damage was not happening instantly, which should be given attention to the first signs of the current reparation programmes.
The member of the National Research System also explained that the transport charge is another important factor in the training of drums, and therefore the length of each layer of covering should always be with transport load, and it is necessary to ensure that this requirement is fulfilled in order to prevent frequency feeding.
Rafael Errera said that many things still need to study and make, for example, bitumen emulsions already on the market in other countries and even helped meals with easily and without use of high temperatures.
What was not enough for the candidate from Vale to become a new Miss Columbia?
Analysis of the reasons that prohibited Serne Meline Ramires to get the crown of Mrs. Colombia.
Representative Valle received the title of the Princess 14 times.
Vale del-Kauka was only wanted to receive the coronation of Miss Columbia.
This time, Melina Ramires Serna had to be satisfied with the outcome of the winners with the silver crown and the lobby announced by her new princess of Colombia.
Taking into account the result of the last night in Cartachen, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and scupeter, the department includes 14 titled princesses, and Melina is attended to a woman from Wale Del Cauca, who were close to the coron, but were declared by princess, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Dominage (1949), Patricia Belly Ala (1979), Lorenna Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Mary Arense (1987), Layla Blanke (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sansulla Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hisei Al-Harresse (2000 Harrefe), Harredo (2007), Harrefoy (2007), Harredo (2007), Harrefoy (2007).
A question which is now behind many:
Because the result of the damage of the main favorite, which in each of the statements of a demonstrator has everything to be a new Miss Colombia, it was not simply chosen by the Royal Police and the most beautiful person in Vogue, the titles of the Queen, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the coronations of Mrs. Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the decision of jury to condemn her the title of the First Princess was that she didn't be convinced to answer the question "What book characterizes you and why?, given by Martin Murille Homes from the literature society Let us consider.
She answered the questioner:
"I'm reading much, I believe in literature, I think it's an ocultation, and I'm sure that the book that characterizes my personality is the "Small Prince" is a quite deep book.
Today, I read the "Republishment and Penalty" is the leader of the world literature that we should all read; I read the book of Irina Nemiro, Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Black of Blood".
The answer that did not like jury because of the term "occulture" and, secondly, because he did not explain exactly how each of the quoted books characterize it.
But after Melina's ceremonie, she said she was quiet and satisfied with her result: "The inhabited wise is going to happen."
And you all, please, read at least a little, "Small Prince" is a big book.
In the middle of the sound hypothesis, Vale Berg of Favoritism.
The reporter from Bogota suggested that, since it was preferred, it had been met by agencies, and she was a candidate who had received all the preliminary recompense (colinic with Oster's vote, a visionary vote for the best national costume, and the Queen-Matha), "which raised the ability of other candidates, the consequence of stress at the Queen, and as a result it did not brilliant on the scene."
And this was noted during its first presentation in the buyer on the beach of Hillton and during two shows on the evening coronation.
Although it was sure in both aspects, it was noted that she had no power and energy demonstrated by the representatives of Magdalene and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was called princess means that a candidate who wins more rewards during the concurrence does not become a Queen.
Moreover, the representative of Valle has recently avoided communications with pressure, and it was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle has lost an attempt to convince Jury to be interested in its interest, which is finally the existence of the National Concurrence of Blood.
That is why, two days before the election of a member of the international jury of Lucy Dotti said that they were looking for a woman responsible for their country ' s needs.
"One beauty is not enough for Mrs. Colombia, we should look not only on the outermost but also focus on public conscience before they participate in competition, they should already be held in projects," she said.
There is also an idea that the representative of Vale was wrong with the defects of the gentlemen and phybrosis that was seen in her life, but it is worthwhile, since the jury noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good food and the responsible physical body.
The Royal Royal Advisor Horhe Ernan Orosco notices that Melina had not the best body that was and better, "but the problems of phybrosis on life which were not very noted for me have made her lose the points last day."
Yet, the journalist Guido Oios in the magazine Kroos believes that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that it was a surgery to interfere.
"The operations are good, but the representative of Valle doesn't know how to do it.
Her body was never her privilege, and here she was punished for it.
As a result of the prize, which was the first time in charge of the National Concurrence of Beauty organizers, the wrath predict occurred last night, said that it was the boy whom Raymundo gave Meline as a compensation because she lost her satisfaction to get a crown.
So this is or not, the fact that Melina begins today, not as a Queen, but as a princess, the position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia on one of the constructions specified directly by the national concurrence organisations.
However, she is in the history as one of the kings who, despite its excellent statement on the concurrence in Cartagen, faced difficulties in receiving the crown.
That was the work of a man who recognized the body of Alfonso Cano.
The criminal from Cali entered the story as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these staff is key.
On 4 November, CTI Cally criminal entered the history as a person who confirmed the identity of the FARC Chapter Alfonso Cano in comparison with his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminals who worked in the CTI this week, Elizare Gonsales, a man from Puerto Tehada, who had conducted 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzáles worked in the cities of Choko, where he often had to split more than five days through the jungle to reach places where the body had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Vala and after the relevant courses, he was a criminal specialist, where he studied the skin trends, i.e. ladons and stones.
On the week of the operation of Elizare for a man, like Alfonso Cano, he was told to take clothes not more than three days.
Something big came up.
On Friday night, he arrived at the Cook hostel in Palmir.
He knew that he would have to recognize two bodys, and one of them was supposed to belong to a man who had entitled the older party war in the world, so they asked him to take ten pictures of the prints of Gilermo Leon Saens (his actual name).
However, when he arrived from the group's studies to the place where the body was, he did not recognize it in the outer form; he was very different from the mass information.
He was no longer, he was clothing as a farmer, and he was no longer worse.
But the prints won't be.
Increasing glass, tissues, bottles, and fountains, Elizabeth spassed the fingerprints of the body with those on the photos.
It was Alfonso Cano.
At the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehada requested to confirm the Defence Minister of Juan Carlos Pinson that this was the RWSK
Search fingerprints
For a specialist in the field of the Sijin Department of Kali, the recognition received by President Juan Manuel Santos, Elizar Gonsales on the press-conferences on the conduct of the operation against Cano, is significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Yes, the logoscope is a strict science, without error, it can play a key role in discovering crimes.
In addition to the identity of the body, specialists to the coloscope participate in investigation of crimes such as stealing and murder, and establish the identity of the arrested.
Many criminals have certificates or have no documents when they are arrested.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the base.
The studies said that in the case of stealing, he had to bring the wall of the house, because the wall was in hands to possess the seif, the fully valuable and the money.
"They are hard to work with walls because they are not me to be a useful surface for printing, but in this case we can make a picture of the whole staff and set up the identity of a criminal who has participated in several furniture," he states.
The prints also helped to exclude or establish the participation of suspicious in murdered cases.
Recently a dead man was found with bottles under the liver around him.
In the investigation, it was established that the crime could be suspicioned by a family and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottom were covered.
Although it doesn't guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was on murder.
The CTI specialist explained that there is a chemical or physical reaction in the place where there are prints.
When they appear, a bottle or a feet is used to remove them.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is a criminal database, or is recorded.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of non-communicated colonies," said the CTI expert.
He explained that it was not all as shown in the CSI TV.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not all that you touch, the rest of the prints will be printed.
However, if possible, comparison is produced.
"Wormful people" rejected the calls to the authorities of New York
Hundreds of protestants struck the camp before the Zokkotta area.
Part of protestants heard the judgment of the court on the exhaustion of the demonstration from the area and was made to the neighborhood park.
The members of the Wales Street Movies were cast on Tuesday, when the New York authorities were trying to return, under the protection of a judicial vision, to Manhattan, from which they were evacuated in the light when they tried to catch another park of the Great Jabblek.
Hundreds of protestants went down in the area of Zukotta, where they wanted to go through a trial show that allowed "injured people" to break the camp in the area until the other part of the motion answered the road by taking a park north of the city where further arrests were taken
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to break the camp on the ground, we'll break the camp anywhere else and continue the trial fight for returning to Zukotti and through peaceful seat and demonstration," said one of the representatives of the Motion "Take the Wall Street" Mark Bray.
Bree explained that the response of "injured people" on the evacu of the palace city, which was given by the officer of New York Michael Bloomberg, was sent to the court where Judge Lucy Billings had issued a position that prohibited the evacuation from the area and allowed demons to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, "anxious people" came to the capture of a new park settled on the sequence of the central streets of Canal-Strit and the Sixth Avenue, near the entrance of the Holland tonnel, which consists of New York and New Jersey, and who is in the own of the Church of Trois.
At least a time they could take this place, but then the police arrived and came to arrest some of the protestants, although Brey could not call the exact number, but Ephe said that he saw several journalists who were also in the hands.
The Organization assures that several hundreds of people stood with palaces in the place where the delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support for the members of the movement, trying to speak as a mediator in sexual negotiations.
However, the Zokotti area, which is a private government, remains closed in the expectation of a judicial hearing appointed on Monday, in which the legislation of today's morning division of protestants will be considered.
From the protesters, who moved there, brought and spread the copy of that court and even gave these copys to the police protecting area, which led to " some small consequences", said Bray, who claimed that some of the police were demonstrators.
The judicial establishment prohibits the authorities to evacuate members of the Wall Street Motion and to force " laws issued after the start of the arrest, or to prohibit the democrans to get again access to the park with magazines and other properties which have been spent before."
Mr. Bloomberg said to reporters that the court had stopped the opening of the public space and demonstrants had been informed about it, but the laws do not allow them to re-distort the palatin stores and spa shoes.
The member of the Municipal Council was personally justified by the elimination of protestants from the Zokotta area on the light, oper, in the course of approximately 200 arrests, and the decision was taken because the protestants " violated the law".
Bloomberg said that he had given the order to clean the area because it became "the place where people were not protesting, but violating the law and, in some cases, to bring damage to others," since " certain companies had been threatened" and neighbors were afraid of "the damage of life quality".
This morning's evacuation was disgraceful and shows that Blumberg's soul is more interested in the protection of the financial interests of American slaves," added the representative of a movement that condemns the measure for "no respect for the freedom of words".
The responsible for Wall Street ' s occupation also showed that they were intended to organize " gross action" on Thursday in interaction with public and professional unions to remember the last two months of protests started on 17 September.

Along with Michael Buble and other publishing Canadians, she will appear in the television programme of Russell Peter's birth of 1 December.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tima Allen in the "Most Reparation", saved the Savior of Malibu, Banny in Plaiboe, the rock musician wife of Tommy Lee, and now the actor and model will become the Devi Maria's special birthday show at Canadian TV.
The CTV-party telephone has announced today that Anderson and Michael Bubl and other publishing Canadians will appear in the "Russel Peter's birth programme" on 1 December in the role of Mary's special role.
The CTV has presented the pictures of the TV show, in which Anderson, also a broadly spread on the Internet with a video home pornography, where she figures together with her husband, the Möttley Crüe group, Tommy Lee, is clothed as Deva Maria, holding in the ice of the cocktails of Jesus.

In advice to Anderson and Peter, the CTV special birthday show participates in the Canadian song Buble, who was married at the end of March in Buenos Aires on the Argentine Model of Louisiana Lopilato and who also knows a lot of scandal.
Recently, Bublin called "suck" American Kim Cardashian during one of its concerts in New York
Japan reborn after Earth
WTO increased by 1.5% by means of internal consumption and ended the fall wide which began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and has too been controlled by the devastating land of the nuclear crisis, the greatest disaster transferred by the East Solar Country since the second World War
According to the first evaluations of the Government of Tokyo, the loss material was $300,000 million, which, despite the severe world situation, has passed.
After three deficiency quarters, the data on the wave internal product from July to September were definitively helped to reverse the page: The PRC increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent in the year calculation.
In the second quarter, Japanese financial year begins in March 2012, also highlights the fastest topics of growth from January to March 2010.
Regeneration may be explained by the rebuilding of machinery equipment to restore areas that are desolate by the land and followed by the Suns.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against decreasing 0.9 per cent of capital costs observed since January to March, the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real breakdown in the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keinsian impulse, which calls for the crisis for strengthening or restructuring the infrastructure, using the lips to grow from zero.
Japan was awakened, mainly through the development of the consumption of households, which now consists of 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This indicator increased by 1% of the increased costs in car, travel and relaxation.
Claymo Yen
Tokyo before the internal market, when yen - a Japanese currency - became one of the "value-refuge", chosen investors who want to be released from the crisis in the area and the negative predicts of the United States, the privilege of putting as a stone on the account of exporting companies.
In the more powerful currency, the deep production is a serious impact on the country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technological companies.
Theota or Sonny, for example, are guilty of yen in their low indicators from July to September.
As long as markets continue the EU periferic countries, the Government of Essichiko Nod does not decrease care.
We must be careful for maintaining risks, such as the damage of some foreign economys, the impact of the invasion in Thailand and the strict increase in the value of yen, said the Ministry of the Economic Policy of Motohis Fua yesterday.
And actually, the pers are not anxious.
The Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OECD) reported that most countries-participants demonstrated evidence of the decline of economic activity in September.
The indicator for global economy breaks showed that the main forces are quiet.
Then he fell on four tens to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The area has even fallen below the average value of 100 points after it has been decreased at 8 to 99.13 points.
Athens give the ground again for doubts
Papadimos said that the correction would be in place, but the conservators would not sign any written obligations
With peripheric premiums for the risk and indetermination of the parks, Greece continues to blame the labyrinth, which is the result of a great crisis in Pee.
The feeling that the "a" new transitional Government of Ellada is linked to Brussels' demands, rather than the true conviction of political forces, begins to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos warned yesterday that there was no structural arrangements and that the timely period in which he was appointed could be inadequate for their application, the leader of the Conservative Party " New Democracy" Antonis Samaras assured that it would not support the new steps of the strict economy in any case and repeated its request for the new elections appointed on February 19th.
The main task of that Government is to carry out the decisions taken on 26 October, Papadimos said yesterday by opening Parliamentary debates that are held tomorrow with eighth trust in the new executive authority.
The Package of 24 programmes to increase the population ' s employment, reforms of the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax-reduction will be the first report.
However, the message of Samaras does not explain doubts about his position: "We are ready to help the transitional government, but we promise nothing."
The leader of the conservators made more in their opinions in the EU and the MVPs, organizations that would have to frozen 8.000 million who were urgently needed to Athens, and explained that he would not grant his approval to any letter on the agreement with the requirements of the Treaty.
However, the Commission, still testing the effects caused by Papandreu's referencement in the style of everything or nothing, repeated that its requests were unique yesterday: it would not renew aid if the new Government and leaders of Greece did not sign "the written agreement without double-sensitive and as far as possible."
The Representative of the Ministry of Economy of Amadeu Altafay said that the triples could " very quickly" return to Athens to discuss with the new Government, "what must be done to pay the sixth tranch" by 8.000 million, although the exact date is not yet designed.
In the Greek club, there's a little bit more.
Mrs. Sofia: "This are the tools of progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized the "basic" place of Spain for this type of financial
Spain "maked a visible place in the world in the field of microfinancing".
The Queen of Sophia on yesterday said that in the last two decades of the country, it was a second donor in relation to the instruments of cooperation, whose " reality", she said, "and that it was the way of progress, justice and hope for the best future of the faith in humans."
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Micro-creditation Summary in Valjadolida with the conviction that " there is no doubt" that such actions are "compatible" to achieve the objectives of the Millennium of the United Nations for 2015, and "with a view to a decrease of two people less than one dollar per day, the level at which "poverty is fixed".
Spain " still works" to enlarge the network of receivers worldwide and acquire this task with all the "responsibility", says Sophia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the Sammit's course that will continue until Thursday will "secure the creation of new ways and best ways for the poorest people, and especially for women, "based receivers of these gifts".
There's "may achievements" and "may work that we're doing with."
The microcreditation summit becomes not only a place for Property but also a form that contributes to "two main objectives".
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that at the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would be spent by these financial services and that hundred million of these households would be chosen from the poverty in which they were threatened.
The Impuls for the creation of a microcreditation system in Spain and throughout the rest of the world " went on the road beginning year ago" Mohammed Yunus, emphasized Mrs. Sophia as "the act of justice and recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "beautiful idealist in general against poverty," whose work has been carried out for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his credit policy.
This year later, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Cot-d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I have seen a continuous development overall," said Her Majesty, who has brought her the title "the family heads" in Valadelide "poor banker" yesterday.
Finally, the Queen of Sophia concluded the statement, invited the present to participate in the discussion and to find decisions to continue in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperial"
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Trinidad Himenes said that solidarity is a " ethical empire" for each democracy of the State.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries with economic paper times, as it is "continuous commitment".
Chimnes has concluded that microcreditation assumes a "serious and firm course towards poverty and poverty" and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries should work as solidarity criteria and not allow it to be a victim of cost reduction.
Microcreditation is " one of the main areas of development cooperation for Spain.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodrigues, highly appreciated the "success" in giving "certainty" to people "determined for all the doors closed" and Mr. Valadelid Francesco Havier Leon de la Riva welcomed all the presents in the city that "opened his doors with a spirit of solidarity".
HDS will choose the Chairman of the Commission by a general vote
On Monday 14 November, the first day of the Christian Democrat Convention (HDS) in Leipzig passed without problems for the officer of Angela Mercel, who is also a Christian Democratic Chairman of the Party.
The future has not been originally planned in the programme, but it has been the only east, in particular to satisfy the activists that believe that government policies are not so strictly as should, today by means of Greece and may be tomorrow to Italy....
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the Commission, which you have to discuss, was almost uniform.
Of 1001 delegates only nine votes against and ten refused to vote.
The stage of the stages, which have continued a few minutes, which have deserved their statements of Ang; Mercel and a few hours later, Walfgang Shawble, Phil and Minister of Finance, have not left places for doubts.
The basic idea of the officer and the draft resolution is expressed in the lozing: the true response to the crisis is " not less," but more."
Not only because it means the world, but because "new million slaves depend on the stress."
For the officer, "the time has come to break in."
This may mean changes in the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the Union's financial policy of the countries of the region, but it may also affect the elections of the President by the Commission by the general vote " to give a person".
In any case, it is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the assembly, which obviously belongs to Walfang Shawble.
Of course, twenty-seven countries are not likely to make this decision quick; the United Kingdom speaks against it, and the leaders of HDS believe that Nikolas Sarcozy is also against it.
But the ground is ready.
In the same way, the delegates of the majority rejected the vote of each country, a member of the Union in the Government of the Central Bank, with the economy of each of them, which would not have increased the weight of the German economy.
In order to relax the situation in her party, the officer increased the amount of employment at the Adenauer Conrad and Helmut Cola, but she did not strive to influence the assembly on account of " small" countries or countries in a difficult position that would like to criticize the "heather" Germany.
Although in the draft resolution on the whole paragraph, the importance of " German and French friendship" is highlighted, Angle does not have France.
It's just a middleway.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig's scene of blood battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliated disorders of the Napoleon Army.
What's the crazy with hospital sheets?
Following birth facilities, UMP and the Government started hospital letters.
On 15 November, Nikola Sarkozy will come to Bordo to visit the family fund and to discuss this issue periodically raised since 2007 on the fight against deficiency in the field of debt.
And to help the desire to find a difficult situation, but also a part of the re-electing campaign at the presidents, most want to end on hospitals.
Firstly, in view of the budget economy, the Government intends to link private companies to the fourth day of unpaid release before the start of the payment.
It is obvious that without a consent of the employee who is sick will lose the payment for four days, at least 15% of its monthly income.
Mera, which threatenes the wrath storm, but which, according to Les Echos, will lead to the economy of 280 million.
And which will be conducted by other measures with more symbolic effect, namely to assign public servants one day without payment of disease (the public servants had not to wait for the payment of the loans, in the contrast with the three-day expectation of the private sector).
Now, when discussing these issues, the majority of them also resume the topic of poverty, in the meaning of misuse in the reporting of hospitals.
The control will become stronger and added, if you think, you will have to return all the payments you have received illegally," Ksava Bertran on the RTL channel on Saturday 13 November.
Like in other cases, the effect of the statement has occurred incompatible with real misuse of hospital sheets.
They are actually subject to constant control and political attacks since 2002.
People in France are not more sick than anywhere else.
Let's first look at the numbers of the country.
According to the National Medical Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million agencies were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of Health Economy, the daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to 11.3 million.
46 per cent of this amount were determined to decrease and accidents in the production and 54 per cent in the disease resources of 6.2 million.
It was therefore 2.5% of the costs with health.
The French held at a medium of 14,5 days in 2010, compared to 17,8 days in 2009, studying Alma Consulting Group.
The average arithmetic which hides some rejections; the second study conducted by the Care manager Monster.com site in 2007 showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 deputed French persons said that they had not taken any hospital day.
Another investigation, this time, states that 37 per cent of hospitals were less than 8 days in 2010, 15 per cent from 15 days to one month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent longer.
If you compare these numbers with the numbers of neighbors in Pedago, it is evident that the French farmers are no longer inclined to take a hospital than those of any other country.
The long studies carried out by two CNRS researchers in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total deficiency in France (for health reasons or not) was between 10 and 11 per cent, compared to 20-28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
A very low level of inflammation with hospital sheets compared to "serious" occupation.
What's going on at the level of brain, he's very low.
The violation of the law after 2002 led to the system of over 45 days of hospital inspection.
In 2008, from 1.5 million cases checked in the CNAM, 13 per cent of the 285.000 claims on short-term disease were " injustified" or too ≥ 37.050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital sheets, more than 45 days, 11 per cent of the cases of 1.2 million were " inconsistent or unbased", which is equal to 132.000.
In general, 169 000 cases were "unbased" on several millions of patients, received hospital letters.
The numbers that have a very few cases compared, for example, with the "search" numbers of employment.
According to UMP Dominica Tian, the author of the report on this issue in June, they constitute from 9 to 15,000 million non-recommended budget income per year, exceeding the total expenditure for daily compensations, and therefore infinitely above the loss of fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow the new regulatory plan
Greece needs a new regulatory programme to save its economy.
This was stated on Monday 14 November in the parliament of Prime Minister Lukas Papadimos, adding that 100 days delivered to his coalition government were insufficient to carry out this task.
"To achieve the objectives of the economy ' s salvation, we have support for our partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Government chapter, who made its first public statement by opening a debate on the full confidence in the parliament in the environment.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the region of 27 October must be the "basic task" of the new Government, since the presence of the country in the area " is placed on a map", he added.
Papadimos therefore predicts a decrease in the country's budget deficit of "approximately 9%" from the BDP to the end of the year, at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the measures of the new Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the rights, expressed its support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the crisis, but warned that his party would not support the supplementary measures of the strict economy.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at the meeting with deputats from his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the tasks of reducing deficit and debts and fighting the debt, but also the failure of any course that prevents the recovery of the economy.
Ollie Renu, the Peeis Commissioner responsible for the economic and assurances, who warned that IMM and EU were not to block the credit of 8 thousand million without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras answered that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under the external pressure.
The Committee of Experts states that it is necessary to enhance efficiency and suicide with external assistance
Canadians refuse to die, confirmed in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
The Committee states that the Government, health and doctoral institutions work together to ensure the best paliative assistance, and that does not consider cancer cases.
Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9% of the canadians are told their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the outstanding reports of the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from different areas, including ethics, rights and medicals.
The Committee will allow the Government to change the voting code in order to allow suicide with external assistance and efficiency when this choice is subject to circumstances, and the patient can be considered competent to make such decision.
For the beginning of the experts, the Economist of the Expert Bureau has recently been investigated, comparing the death cost in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada is on the 10th, the investigation notes that "the death medicine in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid of death".
For medicalisation or not, but 77 per cent of the canadians have no access to paliative assistance, report the experts appointed by the King Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end death in the hospital.
The highest country indicator in Quebec, where 86 per cent are in the hospital.
On the delicate issue of Eutanase and Suicide, the authors of the report have concluded that it is contrary to the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the Code of Appeal on Evtanase and Suicide with external assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been enhanced or decriminated, there is no evidence that this decriminalisation is a misuse in the application, which is the evtanase or suicide with external assistance for people who cannot or do not want to make such decision.
On the contrary, he confirmed in the telecommunication of Joselin Dawney, who reported, most of these cases were in countries where eituation and suicide with external assistance were not allocated.
It is evidently illegal in Canada.
Suicide with external assistance in Canada, where it apparently is illegal, explains Joselin Downey.
Euthanasia Canadians
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of the canadians were prompted to evaporate, because, in 2010, Angus Rayd's question, they believe that it would allow people to facilitate their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66 per cent believe that evtanazing will not be a sign that the life of older people or persons is less valuable.
41 per cent of the demanded people who have been helped in self-mords believe that they should not be pursued in a vote.
As a result of the prolongation or discontinuation of the disease treatment, the situation is less unique, the authors of the report.
In addition to their other recommendations, they have to establish that the voting code should be established that the legal interruption of the medical proceedings is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health experts teach in the spirit of respect for the refusal of medical advice at the end of life without fear of voting persecution.
The Committee invites the Government, the Medical Health Service Institutes and the doctors to work together to repeat the best of the paliative assistance, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to a palyative or terminal session already widely applied in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve for the deterioration of physical pain as the eutanase and is subject to the same situation.
Notes of other experts
Experts in the field of health law have already concluded the conclusion of the report of experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Metr Peter Deshan, a health law specialist, described as a "finity" position of experts who signed the report, as it does not include the use of eutanase in cases.
This opens the door for a situation where the person who has been raised from life and who is more than 18 years of age can ask for aid in the end of suicide, Dechan says, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metr Dessham also stressed that the authors of the report, as it is, set the independence of the person above all other prices that constitute the society's weight.
He said, "The society has a warning of signs and prohibitions."
Morgaret Somerville also expresses " a category of non-release with the conclusions of the report, which she called " Evtanase Manufacturer".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, provides, in particular, the reports relating to misuse in some countries where eutanase and suicide with external assistance are allocated, such as in the Netherlands and the Oregon.

Damask condemns "contract"
Syria is in greater isolation
The Parties of Bashara Asada performed a demonstration yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

In turn, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, expressed a regret for the fact that the median efforts of Turkey, started at the beginning of this year, did not have success.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in the world with their people and who cannot satisfy his desires, lose authority, he said, by turning to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey takes a more harder course.
By their part, the United States welcome the "enlargement of the consensus against Asad and the Syrian regime", followed by the decisions of the Arab State Ligue and of the Union.
The international community, the United States, the Union, the Arab States Liga and the countries such as Turkey, has taken a worst course for repressions in Syria, Mark Toner, representative of the State Department.
At that time, 16 citizens and at least 19 representatives of the forces of the regime have been killed in the area of Dera in the south of Syria, reported the Syrian Human Rights Watchpoint (OSDH).

After his decision to exclude the Syrian League of Arab States, " the mechanism for civil protection and requires 500 members of the Arab Organization on Human Rights, Journalists and military observers in the country.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Alan Jupe, also expressed the remission of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which, accordingly, was "paranoi".
The new emergency stage is planned in Rabbate to discuss the outcome plan adopted on 2 November and, in particular, the outcome of armed forces from the cities where fighting is going, and the release of arrested demons.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia Sergei Lawrow yesterday called a "incorrect" decision of the Arab State Liga while China called Syria to carry out a crisis plan, but refused to support the sanctions against Damascus.

The Russian Scientist has assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
The Russian Scientist Viceслав Danilenko helped Iran once to detonate the nuclear use of the American Agency on Monday, which was specialised in the area of atomic danger.
The International Science and International Security Institute (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAGATE) and other UN Agency ' s documents to establish the identity of this scientist.
The MAGATE expressed anxiety on the last week of the Iran nuclear programme
According to the ISIS, which was significantly based on the MAGATE documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked 30 years, "the beginning of the sixty years, in the Soviet nuclear center in Chelabinske (Ural) and was participated in the production of synthetic explosion methods".
In 1989 or 1991, he went out of the center to create an "nanoalmaze" company in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian advocate in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia
In its report, the MAGATE refers to "evident signs of the development of Iran" of the nuclear detonator system, "the work of a foreign expert, which did not only know this technology, but also reported to the Agency that he worked most of his career on this technology under the military nuclear programme of his country".

The total number of crimes for hatred, according to the FBI, increased very small to 6 628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
After the decrease in 2009, the number of these crimes will be again, underlined by Human Rights First, "the increase in cases of violence against the Muslim is significant", added in the Official Communication.
"Human Rights First has a long time underlined that violence acts against Muslim, as well as all forms of crimes on the ground of hatred, should be considered as serious human rights violations," added one of the Romans of the Organization of Paul Legendr.
"American Government may and must do more to cope with these crimes, adding, thinking that it can be done by improving the police reports on crimes on the ground of hatred."
"The crimes on the ground of hatred" in the Federal Law are followed by the period of fighting for civil rights.
This law was adopted after the death of Mars, Luther King, to punish the acts of violence with race, color of skin, religion, nationality and in our days of sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its form and becomes like Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter microblog site changed the presentation of its form that allows its users, in particular, to see the activity of those who follow what this service does like Facebook.
The new "activity" and the other "name" tab allows to be easier and directly monitored by other "twitters" activities, the Internet, whose messages you follow ("twity"), and those who follow your.
This provides the opportunity to disclose if they repeat communications if they are signed on new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested "in a small percentage of users in August" before the outcome of a broad network on Monday, AFP said to secret Twitter Caroline Penner.
Twitter, who was long-termly intuitively incomprehensible and used enough unexpected terms (RT to overcome some strange message, #followfriday to recommend other users) is mainly a pleasure for experienced users, thus opens itself for a widespread audience, representing something closer to the Facebook and Google+ networks.
The Internet users discussed this new introduction using "twitters" on the Internet.
"It's fucking, worthwhile, and a cluster reminds Facebook."
Functional activity helps me better monitor certain elements of my stream in Twitter, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Constitution of the Golden Rules of Budget
The great coalition of the social democracy and Christian democratic authorities in Austria decided to enter the budgetary " gold rule" on Tuesday to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid the possible reduction of the rating agencies of the State credit rating of Austria (Tree A).
Cancler Social Democrat Verner Fayman has personally announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers, while the Austrian State holds 74.6 per cent, which is significantly higher than the 60 per cent of the standard set out by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the State holding of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's payment had only fallen on one point, from the AA to the AA+, we should have a percentage of three thousand more every year, bringing the argument of vice-conceler and the Minister for Foreign Affairs from the Christian Democrats Michael Spindelger.
Therefore, Austria complies with the requirement of the summit of the members of the region of 26 October in Brussels; the heads of States and Governments need to reduce budget deficits to the end of 2012 and to return to balanced public accounts through constitution or equal law.
The establishment adopted by the Austrian Government reminds the " German model", since Germany was the first country of Peece who adopted this "reglement".
By 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be decreased by 0.75 per cent of the internal product, and since 2017 the structural deficit of the State's federal budget should not exceed 0.35 per cent of the GDP, and the land, as well as the communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to make the State subsequent notes of 60 per cent established by the Maastricht Treaty until 2020/2012.
Esychico Noda
threatens the new intervention on the monetary market
The Prime Minister of Japan Esichiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would take new interventions on the monetary market if the value of yen would continue to grow.
We meet how we did this last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the Iene exchange course, Mr. Noda Senatus explained.
On Tuesday, Iene grew almost up to a historical note that encouraged Japan to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has established a new record of force since 1945.
However, from those springs, investors' purchases have continued to grow in the world and in the world ' s crisis as a "refugee" during these grievous times.
On Tuesday, the dollar was fallen below 77 yen, and faced the sign of the plane below 105 yen, near the level that led to the last intervention.
The 2008-2009 financial crisis of the dollar was approximately 120 yen and more than 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency causes damage to Japanese exports because Japanese products are more precious and reduces the income of Japanese firms because of the conversion to national currency.
"Japan's fighting to restore himself" after the land of 11 March, which were deserted by the region of Tohoku (North East), stressed Mr. Noda, who feared that this growth of Yen would kill a huge regeneration.
The third of the world on the economy renewed the growth in the third quarter -1,5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time per year, using the increase in exports and the consumption of households, suffering from disasters
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of Yen does not reflect the "fundamental economic indicators of Japan".
The Ministry of Finance of Dun Adzumi invited Japan (BoJ), who opened his Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, two-day morning, to take all steps to weakness of yen.
However, the Governing Board of Hirohid Jamagotti warned that the Japan Bank had already taken the "consequent steps" to realize that there was no additional disturbance in the environment.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the increasingly increased by 5,000 million Ien (47,000 million) the purchasing of Casine’s obligations, lifting up to 55,000 million Ien (519,000 million) half of the amounts that it provides for the purchase of various financial instruments to meet the market of values.
Region
rates, fund boards are covered
The risk of infection by long-term crisis is undermined by Pepee index.
Despite the nomination of new heads of States in Greece and Italy and improved growth indicators in France and Germany, taxes in non-stabil countries continue to grow
The remaining suspicioned stability of the zones, the Peea birds went on Thursday, 15 November, a little further in the area.
The CAC 40 lost 1.4% in Paris on 10th morning and ended the markets at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurte fell to 0.4% and London to 0.1%.
As a result of new challenges with the payment of credit countries, the areas of the world's funding markets continue to lose part of their recent achievements.
"Because investors simply are too concerned about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pra, the IG Markets institutional broker, quoted by Re.
The Tokyo bird has been closed by 0.7 per cent under the new doubts of the market shareholders in the ability to maintain a long-term crisis.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has stressed its view on the matter, and the birds will follow each other in the course of a wide change until investors will not be understood that the situation is stabilised," Micusigue Akino, the fund manager in Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This return of anxiety on the future zone will be broken by one currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
It has reached its low note for a half month.
At the 10th morning, the money was 1.3570 dollars, falling by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she fell on Monday after the arrival of the officer of the Angela Mercel HDS party, on which a resolution was adopted, in particular for the country in a complex position, to leave the zone without abandoning the Union with them.
Italian and Spanish rates exceed 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at the level of great concerns.
The income of the 10-year Italian obligations has reached 6.85 per cent today on Monday morning, and the income of Spanish obligations has reached 6.2 per cent at the same time.
These difficulties with percentage rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to promote the concerns of participants.
The Chapter of the future Italian Government of Mario Monty asked for a period of time to restore the situation in Italy under a threat of the parallel under its weight.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the same zone on 27 October would be the " basic task" of his Government.
Spain on the shot of markets before parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The rate between the 10-year-old debt rate of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical majum.
In the expectation of the numbers of growth in the area
France has the economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, a little better than expected 0.3 per cent by increased household consumption.
Insee, however, reviewed the decreasing side of the second quarter, falling in 0.1% of the wall internal product (BDP) instead of stagnation.
And the economys are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in its part, increased by 0.5% for the same period.
The first rate for the whole area is expected at 11 a.m., and the Commission warns about the danger of the new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must be dominated by the dogma
If there is a topic on which the decision is to be taken after a continuous discussion or emotional effect, this is energy policy.
The availability and valuation of electricity directly affects the purchasing capacity and competition of companies.
This is a healthy trend that you choose meetings become a conduct to think about the part and the nuclear energy.
It will not bring fruit until all the economic, environmental and economic consequences of the proposed options will be studied.
France should build its view on objective facts and ratio data.
Now we have seven thousands of people on the planet, the demographic development will double electricity needs until 2050, unless only a large part of the world's population will have a vital life of elements.
During the same period, the increased deficiency of resources will be fulfilled in order to continue electricity production continually, without forgetting the most important need for reducing emissions of gases to address the climate disbalance theme that has disappeared from the environmental debates.
Fukusim's awareness doesn't change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains one in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which puts its decision depending on the need to find a source that is able to replace nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which is intended to build only the most modern reactions.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, Southern, China, India, Brazil are only few of those who are resolving to continue their projects.
After Fukusim, the United States decided to add one installation to their set by rebuilding the building of the Avenue, which has been interrupted after an appeal at the Tri-Mile Island.
Although Germany’s model on renewable energy sometimes brings it as an example, reality is contrary to this argument.
Berlin's choice will result in increased electricity rate, increased energy dependency, increased in imported gas needs, in particular Russian emissions in oxygen gas building.
For a few months, all of these uncomfortable effects will already be felt.
We should consider the example of Denmark.
The campaign is a turbine building from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, and it is the largest carbon and gas consumer because of the wind's interruption; the emissions of oxygen gas and electricity prices corresponding to 65 per cent and 50 per cent above the average.
On the other hand, our neighbors will be 40% more electricity than the French households.
Since in the globalised energy price economy is a key factor of competition and the service of industrial equipment in the national territory, the French companies are benefited from self-electricity.
Consequently, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a big increase in electricity price, which will make illustrative beautiful statements on the new industrialisation of our country and the protection of the purchase of capacity.
The price that most French people refuse to acquire is more because they are not in principle contrary to that kind of energy.
It should be recalled that the energy policy of the country has made an industrial growth in 125 000 primary slaves and 410 000 concentrated.
It is highly oriented on exports, it attaches the whole range of specialized in the international trade of small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many slaves that cannot be moved into another growth.
If France had decided to refuse nuclear energy, it would have to have a large number of these enterprises and lost 6000 million per year from the French nuclear equipment and services export.
What electrical engineer will order the EPR estimated to work for sixty years if the closure of its manufacturer is planned?
In order to resolve the equation of energy, it should be admitted that there are no divine or devil sources of energy production.
Once the Areva firm has low gas emissions , nuclear and renewable solutions, it is evidence of the integrity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, supporting the highest safety level is an important issue of life
In France, we have a security body that provides uncompromising and transparent control of energy centres such as Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionalism is publicly recognised are full of the same security.
For 50 years, the atom industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mile Island, has occurred under normal exploitation conditions, but without any consequences for human or environmental environment
The reaction device and an indirect error in Chernobyl have led to tragedy.
Some people in Fukusim forget that the affliction has occurred due to two natural disasters of unprecedented force, which have caused decades of thousands of people to die.
Nuclear growth will learn from this affair, as the previous two.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between security bodies, operators and French and German co-operators, EPR, represents a project that allows to resist such events.
Since it is considered to be all energy specialists who want to build a reacter, the rest of its building in Flamanville will be a great gift to Areva and EDF competitors, enhancing them the way to enhance leadership in the improved development of atomic energy.
It is necessary and lawfully to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be unresponsibility to allow emotions, dogmas and methods to receive in a way that is so important for our country's economic, economic and financial position.
Immigration is a burden or good for economics?
The immigration policy in Nikola Sarkozy was criticized from different parts - the transfer of police, judicial and administrative services undertaking digital policies and compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed French status as " Human Rights State".
Thereafter, the administrative pressure of foreign students, which was in the release of news, when the Ministry of Internal Affairs ("Liberasson of 23 May") said that France "not needs foreign talents, stones and officers".
But it is very rarely analysed from the economic point of view.
Right and left are in many places.
The right tone was assigned to Jacques Shirakam, who said in 1976 that "900 000 free will not become a problem in the country with 2 million foreign slaves", but from the left, Michel Rocaram, who explained in 1990 that France "not can take the poor from the world".
Difference only at the level of generosity
In 2005, the North of Polish Water Manufacturers felt also the left and the right.
Both parties see the immigration of the burden for the French economy and for the French society.
The difference is only at the level of kindness that they will be allowed to show to immigrants.
In its programme, France Oland was a banality, saying that "the joint work will allow the problem of immigration."
This presentation of immigration as pregnancy and the problem can give electoral advantage, but economically it is very precious.
As Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron's economys remind us in the recent book that has collected the recent information on immigration (Personal people: As a migration of our world's form and will determine our future, May 2011, the Edition of the Princeton University, 352 s.), there is a wide consensus among the experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, for immigrant countries.
Immigration limits to growth weakness and decreases the employment.
The fear of immigrants is that they are capable of replacers, especially low-qualified, by providing loans reduction.
However, experience shows that immigrants actually are much more added than replaced by the slave force to carry out works that are not enough for slavery.
Unqualified immigrants are working in sectors that have not affected the slave force and the most qualified are in dynamic sectors where training is not with the proposals of work.
Positive impact on payments
Similarly, as the surgery would be difficult to work in the country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, interaction between immigrants and immigrants, the income of immigrants has been affected by the deficiencies.
Jovanny Peri recalled that the growth of 1% of the migration stream leads to an increase of 0.6 to 0.9 per cent of real long-term payments.
And it is without prejudice to the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (a large part of natural immigrants among the American Lauriers of Nobel, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo, all were immigrants).
Migrations also provide pure income in the security system by a average 1% of the general budgets of the countries of Peace.
By assessing the World Work Organization, for example, in Germany, the immigrant, at age 30, will bring the public budget a clean income (expenditure) in average of 150 000.
Nicolas Sarkozy was going to enter into the missing points of growth at the beginning of his mandate.
The teeth that has been exposed to fearing the immigrants had an equivalent effect.
The democracy has been obtained and remains aware of the democracy of Pekah
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but at the same time is crucial.
The continent must remember that, in achieving it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century he had survived the tragedy of the I World War, the Toalitar regimes, Holocaust, Gulag, as well as France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
They believed that the democracy would take care of its agamas to make a vote enough and to make it as far as possible.
Since the time of Napoleon "Malgo", this is what happens from the superficiality of thinking.
The universal vote, despite the commitment of the democracy, is not sufficient and can even be "and" pressure, as said by a philosophy resp, Ethyen Washington.
No, the democracy also requires many other public spaces, public spirit, prices, organizations, divisions and controls of authorities, education, economic and solidarity, justice.
The crisis that we are worried is a economic crisis, but in the first place it is political crisis and democracy crisis.
In this regard, the genuine and false Greek referencement will have a double disturbance effect demonstrating the need for serious political changes, as well as an inappropriate feeling of its inconsistency and insecurity.
This duality must be intended to overcome it.
It is that the front line of the fight against democracy has now been moved, and many believe that the republic soldiers are now not on that side.
We will not win anything by requiring a series of national references organized in terms of accuracy and haot order.
"Cart Blanch" for the absolute Moon of Pee's or the shock with the feet to lose nationalism - what choice for a citizen!
No, we are fighting not for the league of the giliton, but for the common, clear and continuous, the election and democracy, this time at the general level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and not much more, because there is only one crisis that is a crisis.
All of the markets and rating agencies are totally subject to the dictating of the markets, suffering from their solidarity and lack of solidarity.
All of this is totally down on the international scene.
Many are concerned about the conduct of the transmission of the sovereignty, but everyone is totally lost its sovereignty, and each of its nations with it.
It is necessary to return urgently to the project of Peeis under the national sovereignty.
Because only the joint peers are able to reduce the burden of each debt, free from the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The outcome of the crisis needs decisions at the general level and they cannot be taken without a full democracy without bringing us to a disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the socialists and Jacques Delor are now required by the Peese Economic Government.
Let's go.
But to imagine it without a stronger economic, political and democracy integration that is in the lives of the grassland, it is a general crazy and a new stupid.
We must start a new stage of construction.
In order to establish a repeat in France, it was necessary to "build" the reply of the people.
Revolution of interest would be insufficient.
This lesson remains in power.
We must build an economic one.
This can only be done by creating a more democracy at the political level of the current national sovereignty of Pekah.
In order to create it, let's create the songs.
The uncontact chip cards are spread increasingly.
World chart exposure is opened on Tuesday in Wilpente under Paris in the atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, in 2011, 11 per cent of global microprocessor sales (bank cards, SIM card phones) will be over 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important sector of uncontact technology that allows public transport or purchases to pay, simply carrying a map over the accounting device.
This year, 460 million uncontakt chip cards will be sold against 320 million years ago!
Their share increases in 2012 (580 million units are expected) and represents almost 10 per cent of the world market of chip cards (6.925 million cards).
The long-term distance from Asia and the Pacific region is now moved in the area of uncontakt.
Approximately 26 million bankcards of Visa have been deployed by this function, and they have 75,000 terminals.
France starts with more modest places: There are 400,000 uncontakt cards in Visa.
But the big magazines are designing them.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontakt Pass MasterCard.
To go to a higher speed, the banks need to discharge their customers' equipment.
"The two large organizations in France have promised in the future to distribute systematic bankcards between their customers, which are accessible to uncontact use," reported Gerar Nebui, Director-General Visa Europe France.
The banks test payments using a phone.
But this is only the first stage of the future payment, which is the phone.
Until only a few equipment are equipped with NFC technology (communication of the nearby field) necessary to comply with such transactions.
"They were rejected.
"But they must actually fly in the year."
"We calculate world sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are going forward.
Crédit Agricole yesterday announced an experiment from December to June of the year in Canada.
The iPhone equipment will be charged with approximately 200 clients and _BAR_ by checks that ensure uncontact payments.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marshall.
Societé General also stated yesterday that he was preparing the market for a proposal that allows his customers to hold phones through the mobile.
The terrorist front is spread from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is in peace with the Islam Magrib connections with the Sect Boko Haram.
The long-terrors of the Al-Qaida group in the Muslim Magribe (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria Abdelcader even declared that the Algerians are now sure.
"Sp, which uses these two organizations, and the reports of secret services are that they are actively cooperating," he explained without detail.
Paris, came to similar conclusions.
The investigation of two French in Nigeria was found in January by two fresh winters.
The persons bound in the restaurant in Niamae close to Aqmi, Antuan de Leocur and Vensan Delori, apparently, were killed on a day with several of the hosts during the operation conducted by the French specialist divisions.
In the middle of the caves, the remaining after the operation, the French and Nigerian investigators found several phone cards, belonging to terrorists.
There's a terror.
Analysis of the name of sounds indicated several conferences in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to the radio France Internationale (RFI), researchers are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a nigerian who lived a long time in Madigure, the city of North Nigeria, Boko Haram and the other to a person, as stated, close to Aqmi and Sect.
"This is a step forward, but, of course, more reliable evidence must be expected before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But that's possible."
"For many years, the sect has received financial and ideal support outside and that it becomes more and more active," says Conle Amuvo, Nigerian research.
In the past months, this support has become more evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and in its methods, which now include the use of explosives and more complex explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community in the Chapter of Washington now presses Abbudju to focus on the problems that Boko Haram has created.
The fact was that the Nigerian authorities had traditionally considered this group as a community of non-interested people.
Quick Success
Based in 2002 in Midigure in the morning, school, and in the foundationalist of Mohammede Yusuf, Boko Haram, which means "West education is sin" - preachs the establishment of the Islam Emirate in the north of Nigeria.
In this poor region there has been rapid success.
It is political and requires a close respect for the chariate and its activists have started fighting the wicked central government.
It is primarily assigned to the church, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram had been active with numerous attacks on the police.
Abbudge's reaction, as usually, is uncompromissive.
The army was a block of the city and left 800 dead after herself.
Mohammed Yusuf, captured alive, was killed in the morning.
Now the sect is radicalised and it's on the part of its northern axes.
In the past, she took responsibility for the action, which caused 80 people to be killed in Jose, and then for another in Abuge.
In June, in Abuge, Boko Haram organized the first attack of the officer on the strengthened police department.
In August, the representative of the United Nations will become their first international goal.
As a result of a terrorist in the axis, which, even from Mauritania through Nigeria in Somalia, is now concerned about all safety experts.
Today, when Aqmi was strengthened in Mali and Niger, and the Somalians from Al-Shabaab are in Kenya, Boko Haram represents a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during the conversation with President Gudlack Jonathan Allan Jupe warned about the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed the promptness to share in all the in­formation.
The world, as it is seen by the presidential candidates
With regard to China, Iran and Israel's assistance, Mi Mi, Romani, Herman Kane and Rick Perry are simplified and incompatible.
Can the weak crisis of America lead a complicated world with simple, and more accurately simplified ideas?
If you listen to the candidates in the presidents of the representatives, the electors could believe that.
A few days ago, My Romney, Herman Kein, Rick Perry and others have been able to make sound, but the detailed statement on the external policy which I traditionally have been used by the strong resistance side of the people.
Losongs, Kassing, China, Iran, and Israel’s help are often mixed.
We're Romani, whose best chances for the "Ald Good Party" have been made, threatened to give Chinese complaints in the WTO and accused them of "manipulation of their currency" is a sensitive topic for America, which is deteriorated by the migration of all its industrial growth in Asia.
But worse if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, the former employee of Obama in China and the only candidate in a complex external policy, did not have to fight the position that affects emotions.
He invited to a strong but active dialogue with Pekin (the present position of Obama).
But Huntsman, holding in the bottom of the ratings, remained unhearted.
In Reagan's style
Romani also promised military attacks on Iran if the sanctions were not able to stop its nuclear programme.
"If they choose me, I'll stop Iran," he told."
"If Obama will be re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel ' s military assistance by accusing Obama of failing the promises to this partner.
Undertake Herman Kane, second in the candidate review, a demonstration of disrespecting cases.
He recently called to oppose Chinese military threats because Peking is trying to get the nuclear power - obviously without knowing that China has already dominated her since 1964!
Governor Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military attacks on Iran, says that it is ready to use the American army in Me'ke against drugcares.
The torture of suspects in the terrorism prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and Michel Bahman candidate.
All this is very far from the resistance of the candidate of John Kein in 2008, a serious external policy.
The opposers of the current President replied that Reagan had a simple idea and that he had won cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to reduce the tone in the fight against terror.
They just insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the preliminary conclusion of " guys" from Iraq, his captives in Libya, which offered him a reput of policy.
But it's not so easy.
The population considers the local balance of national security at Obama, which is eliminated by Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that are involved in the sand.
And claiming that America needs to rebuild economics to restore its leadership, Obama's rights.
North Flood, new gates for Russian gas input.
The North River Gas leading the West River and Russia at the bottom of the Baltic Sea is launched.
He's been calculated as a gas equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian giant gas manufacturer, wanted to release this event with pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of States and Governments, participated in the last Tuesday on the Baltic Gas, between the orchestra and the exhaustion of the outcome, in the opening of the North River, the new gas carrier, which presses Russia and Germany under water.
Cancler of Germany Ang; Mercel, Russian President Dmitriy Medvedev, French Prime Minister France Fion and his netherlands colleague, Mart Ruthte, returned together a symbolic ventilation that controls the income of Russian gas in the West Network.
According to the new gas conduct, 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will be spent each year in the Western Room of 1 224 km long, which consists of the Leningrad area with the land of McLenburg Pomerania.
The second tube drive should be prepared at the end of 2012 by ensuring the total supply of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to France's total consumption.
And the possibility of building a third tube carrier is already discussed in the same direction.
For Gazprom, the timely end of this great project is victory.
The project met an enraged opposite of Poland and the Pribalt States.
The North Flood will actually allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding transition through the third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their authority: they will be more difficult to affect Russia, threatening access to the West markets.
At the most stressed moment of the debates of Varsovia, it did not stop before comparing the North River with the new " German Soviet Pacte " with an Union between Hitler and Stalino in 1939 in order to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that political issues are sensitive.
With the support of this Russian project, the Western is achieved more security of its supplies.
However, the price of non-Energy is because the project has created a barrier between the east and the west.
Russia has succeeded less than five years to understand its direct union between Russia and the rich west countries, which consume large gas volumes and whose own stocks are already in the outcome.
"This gas manager is a part of cooperation with Russia, it is a new artery that organically connects us," said France Fion, opening the gas carrier, demonstrating how important and political and economic gas contracts are.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom chapters, the presence of increasing quantities in Limmina, the coming point of gas.
The maintenance of this gas carrier is also the technical movement.
The subcutaneous tube was made of the stairs captured in the beton to protect it from the ships.
He's on the bottom of the sea, a middle depth of 200 meters.
To build it, the mine fields remained from the Second World War.
"The hundred had to be removed or kept as a caution," said Jans Muller, the press secretary of the North River.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and the floor.
The trumpet is a long metal dragon of weight, a weight of 242 Eiffel stars, without breaks throughout its length, without ventilations and without services.
The control was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers rejected it because Sweden was not excited that the Russian State company would be inhabited forever.
"In the case of avery, we're going to cross the gas flow less than in a minute," says Jans Muller.
So, in the case of a gas escape contained in the gas carrier, you're in the air.
However, this is a little probability for the projects of the swimming projects, calculated only once in 100,000 years.
The control of the gas carrier will be regarded by a underwater robot that drives the ship for external observation, as well as by the equipment circulating within the gas carrier.
The cigarographic device is inserted within the tube carrier with a diameter of 1 meter and is prolonged in front of the gas stream.
After 3 full days of travel at 3 meters per second, he provides accurate information about any metal deficiency.
The gas transport was designed for work for 50 years without the need of the smallest reparation.
The gas circulation is only due to its pressure.
It consists of 200 bars when sending and 100 bars at arrival.
Five companies have joined efforts to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who owns 51 per cent of capital.
Others are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Netherlands Gasunie and the French GDF Suez Group (9% each).
These five companies created a joint undertaking called the North River, which was ordered to build and exploit gas transport.
His apartment is located in Zuga in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly pleasant.
Gazprom then delivered this company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the total volume of gas transport.
"Gasprom will have a full amount, regardless of how much gas will be actually transported," says Jans Muller.
The financing of gas transport was ensured by 30% shareholders and by 70% bank credits.
The total value is 7.40,000 million for two tubes.
GDF Suez investments will be about 240 million.
However, Minorists are convinced that they will buy their expenses because Gazprom has all risks.
The gas carrier is out of the Baltic Sea in Lumina, on a sandy Âg, conceived by woods.
The ventilation of 4.5 meters high is a gas output terminal.
The weighters measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of gas before taking it into German gas transport.
Since Tuesday, the terminal gets one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
It will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine Broadcast
Moleskine, created by the Italian company 15 years ago, will return a cushion to the writing.
He has an aroma of accommodations, hours followed by the letter on the light of the light.
The Moleskine block is easy to find out on a rectangle black cover, on a knife, on the yellow-white pages, like the desired with time.
However, the book of Moleskine, which we know today, was born in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo Company, which is in Milan, decided to launch design blocks in the sale.
Maria Sebregondi, then the adviser of the company, took responsibility for the use of a new product.
The block is inspired by an ancient production technology, a moleky-located boy with a tiny tissue, which is used for the cover of scameek.
It is asserted that this type of blocks highly appreciate the writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has brought the old and forgotten thing that was cultural for artists-avangards to the 20th century," race Mary Sebregondi, who has become a controller in Modo Modo.
It's done.
Since 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% and reached 12.7 million.
We were far away from the production of the first years when only 3000 blocks were produced.
Moleskine passed the border of Italy and was exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to set the profile of the typical buyer, because the block is equally attached to businessmen, students and people of free professionals.
Moleskine buyers are spacepolitical, have large views and education.
The small Italian company, which first had only 12, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and another in New York.
It distributes its blocks in Fnac's bookmarks, small towns' centers, and has made a wide range.
"We follow the spirit of time and this new need in writing, despite the presentation of the email," explains Mary Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural chart leads to the development of Moleskine; the branch has recently organized the "Environment Road", where the artists and artists have demonstrated their own blocks.
In August, he also launched the cabinets with a leopard picture in the case of a film in Locarno.
Following its successes and cultural aurums, Moleskine has differentiated its products, which now include bottles, hands, bags for computers. Brand includes all types of support.
Success that was born dependency: Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, who wrote a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the share of the persons who have been disabilities so high?
Approximately 19 per cent of persons are looking for.
The 15th week of the employee of persons begins today.
Despite the public welfare policy started in 2005, the shares of persons with disabilities are still twice higher than the average, which is 19 per cent against 9 per cent of the total population.
Is she disturbing?
"No, it underlines Eric Blanche, Director-General Adapt, a organization that organizes a week of employee of persons."
"There will be a significant progress in 15 years."
"In that time, none of them was two, but three times more."
"It's very much forward."
It should be said that there is much more for the invalidity of obstacles to work.
Among them, 37 per cent of older than 50 years (17 per cent in average).
They have a lower level of kwality: 80 per cent are not a bacalave, but 2.3 million students in higher education only 10 000 persons.
Finally, a very distributed depth, which consists of 85 per cent for persons with 38 per cent in the average.
Shortly, all these criteria are very complicated to the return to and which constitute a problem," says Cristina Grapen, Director-General Tremplin, of the Association established in 1992 to help firms deal with a person-invalid.
Here's some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about mentality that changes, but too slowly.
The study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise Association on the Cité order showed that the requested managers had a low level of knowledge of invalidity and "represented themselves too delicate people in knives or psychically or mentally incomplete".
Results are private companies with more than 20 persons still far from the aim of 6 per cent of persons who have been in the law adopted in 1987.
The last numbers related to 2008 are 2.5 per cent.
"We are about 3%," says Peter Blan, Director-General Agefiph, organization responsible for the collection of taxes from companies who do not comply with this law.
Proof: The number of "subordinated" organizations as paid was reduced in 2007-2011 from 59.000 to 46.000 (and from 606 to 480 million).
"The Law of 2005, which raised the tax, made a strong pressure on the company," explains Peter Blan.
"But this improvement also reflects the growth of consciousness, in particular in large enterprises."
According to the Department of Employment, only 59 per cent of agencies with a number of 20 to 49 have invalids against 82 per cent of agencies with 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before fighting Cynny on Tuesday evening (20.45 p.m.) Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasure they had received from this friendly bitch.
We're not going to say that there was a secret talk between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting near Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Azar were peaceful.
Five months later, the Belgian trainer can only praise him.
"I am very satisfied by Eden, his movement and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go further," assures Lilla's player.
The fact that until the contrast between its achievements in the club and the collection is one, it is justified.
"I'm in Lila a round year and not in Belgium."
"I've got to work the points."
A repository left in front of this catch with France, in the game against Romania on Friday evening, Azar came to St. Deni to finally "blast".
Don't forget, however, the understanding of "duality".
He supported Blunich since the age of 7 years and the winning campaigns 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also enhances the character of this bitch.
And especially what is on the other side of the Mother, the Johan (Cabe) and the Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"Oh, our ways are just crossed."
"The opportunity to play against them is a pure happiness!"
Leekens remembered the "groundness".
"Groteness" playing a "speaking cat".
"Girdity" also claims as a "neighbor" that France "snow became a very high level team" only a year after the trauma in Nizne.
"Laran Blan was like a hit of the sound, he's excited.
Now, when Belgium's missing, the technical sportsman will fly in one aircraft with blue guiding... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgians will be," he stressed.
"We're building something, players are hungry, they're hungry."
"You're convinced that it is in the future battles, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident of itself
Portugal, Paul Bentu, starts its responsible much against Bosnia (22:00 p.m.) on this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both teams seemed to have lost the feeling of reality.
"To the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and the most important, happy country."
Paul Bentu has already seen himself in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt that the collection of its role since September 2010 is qualified for 2012.
Portugal only in 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a bitch to play, and Bosnia to win.
With regard to 0 to 0 on Wednesday in the hell of Zenia, it is clear that the game is not conceived.
Although Portugal is in the gate for more hours, she could not achieve that covenant that would make it calm.
"This is a good result that, however, is a certain risk."
But at their light of the stadium de la Lucs in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will go through, in the eyes of p ́a, which must be excited, although the math will be very stressed," said the optimist but discreet Bent.
"We are waiting for a very stressed catch, but we are assured that we can win," said a 42-year Portuguese trainer.
"We still have 50 per cent of chances to be held for 2012," said Carlus Cairos.
No one in the moth against Bosnia requires a portugiesian winning on Friday.
Nothing could build a boss.
"This is a good result where, however, some risks, is sorry for Bentu.
"We will play against a team with many technical dignity and players with many individual dignity," he added.
As already in Zenia, the Portuguese are going to show the maximum pressure on bosnees from the beginning, "not give them time to think."
It's a good idea, just this time it's about it.
