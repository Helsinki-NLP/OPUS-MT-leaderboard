CSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or Sugar
The new major cities of the CSSD will, accordingly, have to overcome a certain language barrier to understand their staff members in the Prague Council and in the representative of the CSSD.
Journal Currently.cz New Council members of the CSSD have "tested" as they know nottoricly the slange that has occurred on the council during the last years when the Prague has ruled now coalition partners.
The encoding dictionary, which has introduced the Prague political smittan during the previous era of the primator Paul Bema, describes some of the most famous positions, ≥ ≥ and low in metropolis.
Surprisingly, new advisory ideas did not understand too well.
At least it says.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am more in Prague policy," he responded to the "agricultural" test of the adviser for the culture of Luke Kaucky.
And in the case of a political veteran, he reacted similarly to Karel Brezin's adviser.
Maybe on the "golf jacket".
"It's the only expression that you suggest to me that I sometimes use."
"I don't generally recognize Slang."
From the dictionary, whose expressions of the newspaper Actual.cz published this year in June before the ODS election conference, he chose the text of six examples, mainly those who are nottoricly connected to the Prague Director.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "the biggest golf jacket in Prague", "Go to sugar", "the wheat", "the destruction of the main city" and "smoking".
Three of the council with a cushion agreed, the fourth - Antoine Weinert, who has to lead to the Prague School - he first promised the conversation, but he has not taken the phone anymore.
The fifth adviser Peter Valley refused the test.
"I don't solve these things, and how civil democracy enjoys, I'm going to evaluate."
"I now decide how we will understand our programs," he answered.
As already said, Consequently, Luke Kaucky would not give up in the title above that the talk about the influenced undertaking and friend of the expressor of Bema Romanu Janousch.
"Voldemort" doesn't tell Kauckem anything, and the only term that he considered correctly in the test is "the biggest golf jacket in Prague".
"It's Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky, and now he adds, "but I know it better from the news."
"I'll have to pay a language course," he says.
The golf jacket then as the Tunel Blanka administration decrypts not only the matador Karel Brezin, but also the adviser for Life Property Luke Plachy.
Both social democrates know who is Voldemort, and Luka Plachém is well known where to find this position -- the meaning of the expression "Go to sugar" .
"I think it means going to the Prague business," is the Plague nearly delighting that it's about the seat of the Januski Firems.
Compared with Brisina, he's able to make knowledge more than news than to use such a vocabulary.
In social democracy, according to test frequencies, there is no similar inhibited vocabulary of slange expressions.
"I've worked with colleagues, but it seems that we really have nothing like that."
"We're called more names, sometimes shortcuts and decomoline names," says the President of the Prague CSSD Petr Hulinski, whose sides are overwhelmed by Hulda.
"In the school they called me Briz, but I don't know if the colleagues also call me that," he admits to his own overseer Karel Brézin.
The journal Currently.cz name tried and worked.
Consequent Weinert is for grandparents or less friendly grandparents, representative Miroslav Poche, who warned on himself before the choices of the party's sponsoring, has some of the colleagues of the "Player".
It is also the only way social democracy admits in the internal talk.
Hulin's reporter Huldu doesn't hear, but the journal currently.ch mentioned another overview of this Prague president.
The "Doctor of Worm's Right" says that Peter Hulinski obtained his title JUDr. to the Brotherslave Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "charo ́nic", she issued the brochure.
Women announced in Burkina Faso for the magic of a few common characters.
In addition to older generations, they can not be involved in work, such as health care, free and no children.
The one who's going to become the spectacle is sent to the isolation so that it does not threaten the rest of the village.
"The man just gets very rare."
"There are not even young healthy women, because they are helping to work and born children," describes a regular sister in the main city of Western Africa, Burkina Faso, age in a special house of more than 100 women who have been hosted by their community from their orders.
The local government has now decided to interfere against the unusual "social measures".
She issued an information brochure that would help her to restrict her to the magazine.
He's already got a shock.
"For more than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," he warned on the unexpected outcome of the written lighting journal Die Standard.
The accusation of the magicity is also running in other African countries.
In Ghana, who and Burkina Faso neighbor died last week, Ammy Hemmah's twenty-seventy-year-old, after three women and two men were tortured, poisoned with oil and defeated.
The BBC server was informed about the case.
The guardians claim that it was an incredible meeting of the circumstances.
The woman, according to their version, was exalted by a woman, which is used for ritual ointment.
It's like that he's pulled up after the group wanted to go out of the woman's "build out the evil spirit".
The isolation of "charo ́nic" supports people without prejudice to the level of achieved education.
The journal Der Standard quoted a twenty-five-year businessman from Burkina Faso: "The feeders of human souls represented a danger," he said.
While the government is at Burkina Faso attempting to slow down, the president himself has become the same in Burkina's year.
"The Gambia president Jammy, after his tante died, broke a widespread hunt on a magician, which evidently had to participate in her death and try to kill the black magic and the president's own."
"To help, he called shamans from near Guinea, who, for the delivery of police, soldiers and the president's personal protection, violently addressed the chosen men and women from the villages to the presidential farm in Kanilai," she said in their report of Amnesty International.
On the farm, people had to bear a drunk with a hallucinogenic, which also caused the steel and renal pressure.
Two prisoners haven't survived the farm.
After international pressure, thousands of prisoners were finally released to freedom.
Bakal's payer: Topi in stones, higher payment signed
The older subsequent man walked from the door of the client center of RPG Byty "umbobaron" Zenak Bakaly, the biggest private owner of the rental apartments in Czechland.
Under the guard he took a folder and brought a new rental in it to three apartments: to his own, to his daughter, and to his son who is in the execution of the punishment.
All three were just deregulation.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay for the 2+1 second category 4100 crown from the next year.
"And there is no warm water and top it must be a petroleum (stone on a hot fuel, etc.)," shows the man with a finger in a new son's composition, on which the signature is full of power.
"But I signed it," he explains half-injured and half rejected.
The Civil Association BytyOKD.cz, which marked the new payment submissions as "incorrect and inappropriate", advises the recipients to not sign and wait until the 7.
But the man has only his hand over it.
"One says it, the other it," it darkens.
The island becomes a big deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, a large number of apartments that have in the Republic of Czech still have no payment.
Currently.ch has decided to visit the "laborator" individually.
The Havironic RPG waiter is one of the four in the island, and on Friday, on nineth, it is already full.
The security agency and a calling device stands right next to the door.
The "Large 2011" lights the special button on his touching screen.
One fucking and out of the machine is going out a pack with a number.
You can't even read "157" and your number drinks already on a large screen under the rock of the waiter.
You're in the row for a half second.
At the end of the wedding, the older couple is coming to ask, but the new income is obviously not concerned.
Most people have come to solve running problems like otherwise - requests for reality, accurate events and similarities.
The letters with new rentals are available to the postal box of the recipient with a total of 44 thousand RPG portfolio apartment from half November.
The RPG Byty in letters aims to increase the income by 15 to 38 per cent.
The special transaction to new income was opened at the client centre on November 18.
"It runs over a week, so it's just in the end," answers the worker for a cross-border after a moment of weight when the client is presented as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakalov's former horn dwellings are local emergency subjects.
Before the elections, the president of Parliament and the island patriarch Lubomir Zaorálek from the CSSD was quite stuck, and the local newspapers are still full of it.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new ground."
"And they haven't changed my board on the bathroom," the men mentioned in the introduction.
Moreover, according to the employees, the employees are invited to make sure they will get a sleeve from the payment if they sign the time the RPG promises them in the special offerer.
Self-slave on the holiday rent will also be received by the final beneficiaries who will sign up to 15th.
The Haviron "deregulation" over the wheat but the question is definitely not paid.
"From yesterday 360 clients, there was only about 40 to 50 people for the 2011 payment," they consider the worker over-ground.
Instead, RPG on the web and its consequences has an individual negotiation of contracts where it will be necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree, they will have to determine an independent court.
"It's not about threats, but about information about only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," it warns the RPG on its pages.
"No one's judged here," thinks one of the RPG Byty workers and a man in the street before the client center gives her partly the truth.
"I have 13 thousand income and I have five thousand in food, I don't have to judge," he says.
But the worker's appeal is just devastating.
"We'll see."
"Lord Zaoral shows them in the media that they don't sign, so people may wait," he thinks.
The income regulation ends in the majority of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and, according to the RPG Byta, their economic need is an increase.
"The remaining payable is still not even necessary for a simple maintenance of the living fund," Paul Klimeš, director of RPG Byty's residential portfolio, said that the deficiency of the residential fund is, according to the home owners, a major increase of the income.
During five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could invest in 4 billion apartments, four years from 2011 to 2014, that must be 5.2 billion.
The large-screen screen increases in front of the square seats of the square seats, yet repeat a few redly highlighted information.
"The increase of the rental in 2011 by 15% and less than 31 200 apartments, is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it'll be the most of 7.50 Kč per square meter and month," it will appear on the screen.
Only at 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, the charge will be exhausted by 38 percent.
"In these cases there is an increase from extremely low amounts 19.66 Kč per quarter meter," warns RPG.
At 2600 apartments, the next year will be the same.
The RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not extinguish the loans in a hopp, but will be distributed to four to eight years.
Furthermore, it adds a further commitment: all money from increased rent (see graph) gives company from rental to apartments, mainly to warm resistance - new windows and warming.
It is primarily the right to get people signing an income increase agreement.
The offices belong to the school, they understand the chairs
The Aviopoint building in Brna is the new seat of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to also hide the school with everything that belongs to - with color walls, imaginable habits, buying games and even miniature games on external terases.
Since October of the remote year, she can be visited by the Children of the Arch.Design employees.
The Arch.Design project-architectural company, from which a series of significant brain buildings, calculated with a space for her firemaster since the first diagrams of the Aviopoint building.
It also employs 90 people mainly in babyboom, and it is important that women who are projectors and Property are able to return to work.
Along with the options of broken accounts, the school is the benefit that Arch.Design offers to his employees in the social programme.
Manufacturers and assets have the opportunity to deal with the child's care.
The Ministry invented the workers of Arch.Design themselves and supported the leadership of the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs.
The Framework Ministry is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment and State Budget of the CRR.
Thanks to the grant financing (awards of 2,8 miles [2,8 miles]) they could buy equipment and equipment and in a period of two years the staff and operation.
Arch.Design has the obligation to operate a minischool on their own costs after a period of 3 years.
The preparation of the project was a year and, with the request of grant, significantly helped the Economy Rating.
It ensures the employment staff, the whole day cares for children by the sister and MSH, so children can go to school without restriction, yet they are older than 3 years old.
'Cause it's a "school", it can be only five children at the same time, but in the day, it's more.
The conduct of schools is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the school without prejudice to the hierarchy of the position in the company.
Despite individual education and care, the programme full in the ministry is comparable with the pre-school education programme.
Children are not only playing here, but they are also ensuring quality learning - from the basic knowledge to the preparation to school lawyers, it is also learned by the Ethiopian language.
The class is equipped not only with players, high games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates friends and positions.
Parents can at any time check their child and delay stress with the late exhibition of children from schools remote from parents’ work.
Parents also use work more productively.
It's not surprising that there is naturally a loyal relationship of employee - employee.
Arch.Design has so been associated with the Czech companies that offer a significant benefit in setting new employees are friends to the family and has strengthened personal marketing through this programme.
The house of the bone is fascinating after 100 years. See the interiors of Gaudí
It seems to be buriing a cup of jar, the stairs of the spring of the dinosaur and the balconies are opened in the mouth of fish.
This is the house of Casa Batllo in Barcelona from the Catholic Catholic Antoni Gaudí.
From the local houses, he served his organic faces overseer the House from the bone.
Organic faces, wild colors, unusual use of stones, cakes and mosaics, fasade involving bottles and everywhere present mixed curves, this is all typical for Antoni Gaudí's session.
The head of the house plays dreams, colors, and textures in the area of nature and animals.
In detail, the view of geometricity, ritmus and exactly thought line is to be viewed.
The whole night of the fasad home is even more dramatic, it is highlighted in order to be still strengthened by the shadow of the colour tree.
The guilty and the responsibility of the persons with the same measure also appears in the interiors.
The tree in the walls copys windows, swimming, olive elements of the door, cocktail and bars.
The house Batlló, standing in the quarter of the E Papaple on the widely purchased Pasteig de Gracia No 43, has come to the replacement of the house from 1877 from Emilio Sala Cortese.
Reconstruction spent two years and the house was completed in 1906.
Investor, the rich industrialist Josep Batlló, was able to build old building and building a completely new, but soon Gaudí's idea was accepted to an unusual and lower conversion.
The house of Casa Batlló, but Antoni Gaudí wasn't born alone.
Josep Mary Jujol cooperated with him.
Just on his designer knife, the decoration for the representation of the inability owners and the use of the mosaic on the fasad.
She also worked on the fascist, a number of other creators and artists.
The joint work on Casa Batlló's home proposals was restarted with successful cooperation with Jujol with Gaud.
Jujol shared in the building of Gaudí's house Casa Milá and Güell Park, where there are other Gaudí's works.
He served his organic faces with the "Home from the bone" overseer from the local houses after the end.
Others, because of a specific mechanism of opening windows, began to call him "the living house".
It is also said that on the top of the building, the sword of the Sanhedrin, Catalan, is likened.
Hidden religious motives include other social elements of building.
Gaudí at home proposed a unique system of central heating with luminous air and typical comines for his time.
Bizards can seem to be their 40 degrees.
During the creation of Gaudi, he did not absolutely respect the building rules and refused to join them.
Although at the beginning of the building he received the building authorisation from the city, the data on the planned reconstruction were so weighted that the citizen's advice was deteriorated and requested for correction within two years after the end.
For example, the advisory work was to include the building of pillars in the public station.
Never happened to the repair, however: Only 15 days after the challenge of the city party, Joseph Batlló asked (and successfully received) authorisation for the two highest fathers of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower father.
In the gallery in the second place, there was a community room and in the third part of the bedroom and the private part of the apartment.
The surface was gained by clay.
The entire six-party house is the opposite stage that can be exited to the same coast terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion were the cancellation of all right angles and direct lines and their replacement by walls covered.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of space-building.
The Community part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors and the company can communicate pleasantly, without preserving the privacy needed for more intimate discussions.
Gaudí’s house has also obtained a non - radical destruction and two quarters further, except new fasades.
Gaudí's game is also reliable with light, blue and white musical wheels, which are covered by the interior court, and lights.
The game of two colors adds maximum light in all the fathers of the house.
It was easy to put on the principle that the white reflects the light more than the darkness that the sun pairs rather shine.
Casa Batlló House, which was included in 2005 in the World Heritage Fund of Unesco, can everyone visit.
In the first view of the house, the most space and most honourable living is accessible to the public.
For this step, the participants decided until 2002, at the opportunity of celebration of a hundred fifty-year birth of the slave Creator.
They continued in the view, because they found that it was a very valuable business and that they broadcast on the common and underground areas, including thermos.
The income in memory is definitely not depreciable, does 16,50 euros and students, accommodators, groups and containers of tourist evidence has 20 percent steel.
The sum exceeds significantly the price of access to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
You want to test the right atmosphere of the house with the dragons, you have to scared with some of the people of the jar and visit it directly home.
How to choose matrace and wheat: Women have other requests than men
Never honest with bed, but the quality of the bed's beach, so matrace and wheat, gives the foundation of the reality of a good bed.
However, it must be added harmonicly to declare a specific holder.
When choosing, he decides about matters, from weight, height, height, health status and the owner's sex.
It is also important to the type of internal in which the matrace and the roasts are incurred.
Typical example?
Perhaps on weekend chalupes, where they are not regularly touched, are not suitable latex matraces, because I'm decreasing "free".
Moreover, my weight is significantly higher than the standard polyuretan matrix.
Moreover, it is necessary to turn regularly.
And they have not many airing channels in the kernel, and are still on the fixed tables, keeping the walls: It could also be revealed under them.
It also decides the habits in the choice.
Who has spent a longer time in a spring where many high matraces are often used with a mixing layer, it will be hard to feel well on low and strong surface.
"I hope everyone who came back from the NHL was appealing to me that he wouldn't sleep here."
"For their locked rams, feet and sides, they needed matrace with a mixing layer of powder."
"These are recommended too for people with sugar who have a nervous system injury, so they mistake ,information" from clubs and skin," explains Sylva Hadamchik, which is specialised on a locked accommodation.
Many hokeists, but even the other customers, therefore, have been married with a sung line for years ago.
"It's all right today, appropriate matrace needs Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL fighter to evaluate the wheat line.
This miracle works easily.
It optimizes its dust and fat according to absorbed heat or adapts to your heat body.
There's nothing to do with you, you're not going to turn back as hard after the night.
Just sleep better.
The powder line also works as a protection against the proliferations.
When you choose the size of the matrace to your height, add the length of the walk, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm, so she's bed 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be at a double angle of 90 cm, so dohromades of 180 cm.
At least 120 to 140 cm is recommended in individual beds, such as in singlists.
For a pleasure to my visit.
"In other words, the rule for the width of the dog is easy: when you lie on your back, you should have hands quite quietly cut down in a lock," advises Ing. Helena Prokopova, the characteristics of the Czech Chalonics and Decorators, which is the problem of healthy sleep and ethnomy of the accommodation already a couple of years and transfers it to professional schools.
At the dualhouse, each own wheat and matrace, but here's a watch for the purchase to swim the height of the matracy.
Otherwise, there will be nothing else than installing wheels in different heights, but it doesn't need to be done at any bed.
The wheat matrace should have a height of at least 14 cm, the types of a cockpit of at least 15 cm, calculate at least three centimeters of the creation and cyprus layer.
"When you touch your hands or your matracy, you must certainly not feel your feelings," warns Helena Prokop.
Each matrix requires a certain type of wheat.
The entirely stuck beds, when the matrace and the foundation are like the growing Siam doubles, have nothing to do.
Matrace is wrong, they can't deal with their roads, which is currently running.
And because we're running in the night to 0,2 to 0,75 l of the road, it's like that after five to seven years of matrace begins to put one large (and locked) network.
Therefore, experts refuse advertising slogans on maternal life to 25 years, or even living guarantees.
But everything has its own.
And therefore advice from the sellers' practice: in the mattering of 120 or 140 cm hygiene and working, do not give a filmable drag, but add rai a matracy protector that you can easily collect and prepare.
Though currently the maturity railways are produced in the whole area, we will get two parts (for breathing and size of the stairs very important!), however, manipulation may be used for more types (and on one person) when we are recorded in the fight of a light weight in the ring with a hard ring.
Do you have a stick in your bed place?
Never!
Maximum on bed for visits for one night.
However, you will take care of the table (if it is no longer available) by opening and use the matracy with a cockpit and a height of at least 15 cm with a weight of weapons (with it.Taschenfederkern) and a cypriot level.
Polyuretan matrix does not belong to such a foundation.
On non-containing lame rounds with 14 to 18 lameli will be suitable latex or sandwich matraces (before combination of latex and cocose), but you will pay rounds with more than 28 lamels, and more where the lamels are doubled in the beder and may be to regulate their dust.
It does not include matrace with a coat, because they do not respond to the position.
At the setting of the wedding, he can also be able to embrace the rams.
It's a special capture of lame that allows you to hit or even cut a lamel so that the arm is nicely "forgotten".
For men who have "arms throughout the back", it's absolutely important.
Even the matracy producers who in "Panish" began to use a mixing area just in the frame.
Women too remember -- they will again weight the surface in the places of kitch.
For the most annual clients, crystals or desticles are designed, i.e. multitural perfusion.
The pressure is spread to more points and decreases the pressure.
Obviously, when you use the correct matrix and wipe a bad powder (great and "induced"), the frequency of "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is easy: the powder must support the head and the spices only to the rams so that the rams can be released.
As a suitable size, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, for example in Skandinavia.
In the bed on the side, the powder should be equipped with the height of the ram.
Modern matrace has a powder with pivots filled with grass but only something common.
Their manufacturers are still more frequently using natural materials or at least indirect.
The trend was just at the maturity.
Polyuretan polyuretan pomelates are replaced by natural oil, such as cock and soja.
Maybe all the known producers are using soja.
"It was at the matracy means that the kernel was made from the material purely natural powder," explains Peter Your School from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are used in the production of rivers of matration, one of the first was aloe religion.
But you can also make a microcapsul to release you from the pure woods or legends.
There is also a division for men and women.
While the man "sleep" a plant extracte from the bridge to absorb the wheat of matrace heat and heat the body, I don't worry about the top.
Extract from red pairs increases the blood circulation, so the weakest sex is the heat.
Today's favorite?
Matrace produced from cold powder (a more powder with a corrupt cell structure, is so bigger than a running polyuretan and offers and better elasticity.
Combinations of different cold wheat and "line" wheat produce multiple-zone matraces, which are exactly where the head, beverages and paths are to be.
For the quality matrix, you'll pay from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those who comply with health parameters are lower DPH rate, are portrayed as health assistance.
As the first is achieved in the Czech Republic for this advantage of Gumotex.
It's not easy to look at the matracy and the roast.
Sometimes it may be used for the action of producers or sellers offering two matrices at one price.
Maybe Magniflex tag offers a Duofre matracy with all memory dog Mem's mem's cup in the cave for 11 990 coron.
But the other can be able to make it free.
Ear of lines or high-speaked pounds with an opened cell structure and high-speedness started with the "cosmical" temperament of Tempur material.
He rose up pênly as a material for NASA, because the astrons at the beginning were exhibited by an enormal deterioration.
The temperature in the heat is mixed, the cold is in the opposite.
The heat of the human body will be perfectly adapted and optimally fixed by its pressure.
That is why it is ideal against the appearance of proliferation, but also to increase comfort in sleep.
Viscoelastic powders are used not only for matrace, but also for health products, perhaps for special powder under the feet, which reflect the feet and the living system.
Foreign producers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver powder and similar.
People's tracking tools want more parents, so they want to watch their children
The fear of your own child brings still more people to the idea of watching through GPS.
The system that is designed to carry on cars can also follow the movement of people, thus helping in cases such as the destruction of the nine-year-old Anitka Janatk.
The device is still big as a box from the box, but it can only be large as the hours.
A lot of people feared the case of the disappeared Antzki and began to swallow up their children as well as protecting their children.
Even for the price of their privacy.
"We're trying to say to everyone that it is not about any speech, but about another chance to decrease the probability that there will be a tragedy," Peter Pilin from Macro Weil company, which is one of the suppliers of monitoring equipment on the Czech market.
"I'll admit that in some case, you can get into disuse of such equipment, perhaps when they get into a bathroom to someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't met this case yet."
"The majority of these customers buy out of safeguards," added Pilin.
According to the child, it should be able to know what the "box" serves and how it is used in the case of nausea.
The child physician Dana Bočova warns that if the child wants to wear anything similar, it simply will be saved.
"And very small children show great creativity in how some things are acceptable to lose if they don't want to be under control."
"The great expectations were called before by parents of the mobile mobile, which, however, are allowed to disable the same as these monitoring equipment," said Bočov.
It also states that it's harmful whether such equipment would help in case of attack.
"When it comes to the prepared income, the coach of practice will ensure that the child does not have any electronic that could pronounce his position."
"Now it's a phone."
"When they are going to expand the monitoring equipment, they will also look for them because their sale will certainly be supported by a mass of advertising."
"In that case, criminals will be going to step before the police," says the psycholog.
However, it admits that similar devices can help in the case of continuous pedofil attack.
According to Robert Czech from the RC Monitoring company, which offers monitoring services both for cars and for persons, and in the case of an attack on the immediate destruction of the monitoring equipment, his presence can help.
"The establishment can be set up to regular posts after the expiry of a certain time."
"When it comes to his damage, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"The dear equipment have a building and a clonometer, so even if a person just locked up and remained in a moving place, it sends a device to warn immediately with a position," says Czech.
According to similar service, smart mobile phones can also be carried out with navigation, where it is enough to load and special software.
The problem of current monitoring units is that it is whether the devices are similar to the box size of the box or smaller mobile phones.
They always threaten their losses.
So, according to Pilina from Macro Weil, it is now testing equipment looking like running digital hours.
"It will have the greatest advantage of the eventual agressor not need to know the monitoring equipment at all."
"For it's known until the time and it can give the police time more," he adds.
Whatever follow-up equipment are already developed in boxes or boxes, they will still use the same Âia used for guarding vehicles.
This is the combination of the GPS position detection system (which use running autonavigation) and the mobile phone that reports the current position of the vehicle.
The army has a firewhile that would be in Czechland, but it's only two years.
The Czech Army purchased 445 miles [445 km] of shirts to burn the markets.
The Defence Ministry has already added 224 kilometers to the funds.
The soldier has 225 years of resources.
The problem is that the duration of the bridge is two, maximum four years.
The army bought fires from the STV Group's action, etc. for 40 million crowns.
The general ship in the purchasing of such a large quantity of MF DNAs fuel bullets has decreased that soldiers at the training of 60 kilometers of fuel per year.
However, from the reports of military pyrotechniks, which MF DNES has spoken, it shows that then a very intense pyrotechnical training would have to carry out all the general, experts of the military command, secretariat or clusters each year.
The Defence Minister of Alexandra Vondru and the military commander Vlastimila Pick doesn't take away.
Just so it would be able to deal with the annual need of the army for sixty miles of fire.
This length corresponds to 25 thousand explosions.
And even if it was true, the military resources would be enough for more than ten years.
Instead, it would be payable that for the basic training of each new professional, at least two meters of burnt offerings, as the experts say, the army has strengthened the pure purchase - and with the increased need for genetic or special units - resources for the 225 years mentioned.
In the past, Minister Vondro's brigade soldiers have recently tried to have no hand-weapon shooters, so shoots are also due to the need for the money of the omina.
You don't talk about the lack of the bottom.
"My head doesn't take that we're buying so much burning."
"But it's their decision, and they'll certainly know what they'll do."
"For us, the army is a good customer we are trying to say," says the trade manager STV Group Jan Child.
The Language Ministry of the Defense of Jan Pejšek highlights hundreds of miles of buyed pounds and the army will have the resources of this "municipality" for at least ten years.
Yan Baby from the STV Group, however, speaks only about four years of life of fire and police or military pyrotechnik, even about two years.
"When the perfect storage is, it may also be the four," says one of them, which as a soldier because of the criticism of the Army doesn't want to publish the name.
After the expiry of life, every munition must be carefully tested if it is still reliable and does not threaten soldiers in life.
However, these tests are not free and other money costs.
The further argument of the Ministry is a large number of 445 miles [445 km] flames of fire.
"Sixty percent of us were less than a loneal delivery of two hundred 40 miles," the Dublin speaker Pejšek set up the purchases of the Defense Ministers.
Only for comparison: Annual need for fire-breaking police pirotechniks, which eliminate municians from the Second World War or after the Soviet Army, has not exceeded a number of years of 1500 meters.
And the police demands only a quantity to need this munition before the end of life.
It is evidence for the safety of pyrotechniks, and it can also gain more moderate, and thus more flexible types of pirotechniks.
The Defence Ministry has a significant challenge today with the elimination of tens of thousands of tons of munitions from the time of Varsovia sʹa, when the Tsecoslovakian Army was prepared to get to Rin.
This Czech, according to the pyrotechniks MF DNES, waits for a few years the same problem: it will eliminate hundreds of miles of old fires that "lacino" purchases today.
Today, I'm out of the contacts I've been acquired by the competition
The victory place in the competition of the Year's Victory helped Luke Pytloun to sell the French hotel.
The winner of the last year's competition of the Year's Animal became a 18-year-old businessman Luke Pytloun from Liberce.
His story of success is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun was traveling.
And in the foreigner, he realized that Liberia missed quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
He bought a half-breaked house with five apartments from the back-up brigade and the bank credit.
That he was a third-year-old student of high school at that time, it was a great courage.
"The closer relationship between quality and the price of the apartment in us didn't give me to do something in that," said Luke Pytloun.
The re-constructed apartment started to pay the employees.
All wins invested from the house to house, which gradually translated to the pen with 54 lions.
Since that time, in seven years of business, he gradually opened four pens, two restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity over 300 l all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was added to a four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, but he got another, the same quality.
"We've just been signed with a hotel in the island of Tisé, where we sold our French concept and other interesters on the French hotels of Pytloun reporting," says the remote veterinary number one.
"And on this sale of licence for the service of a hotel, a large measure, the victory has just participated in the competition of the Year's Victory," adds Pytloun.
Victory brought him more knowledge and popularity in Liberia and Environment.
"The people knew me at the streets, often welcomed me, and I have to say that it was pleasant," she said.
Participation in the competition is absolutely recommended to all who try to do something.
There's no need to win, every vision is good.
He says that it's a bit of contacts and knowledge that may not be done any otherwise.
"I started regularly trading with some of the people I met through the competition."
The honour associated with success in accordance with it was so little to each employee.
And that he's got some 70.
"I watch more loyalty and proudness in them that they share in something that has obtained general recognition."
"It's not only my personal success, it's the outcome of the good job of all of us."
"Only my name is spread to front," says Luke humbly today Pytloun.
My representative wants a quieter year than we had in Farmet.
Euphories from the victory have decreased the impacts of the crisis.
But because of the goal of victory, Farmet has worse times behind him.
For the price for the first place in the last year's competition of Vodafone Company, the owner of Farmet, Karel Gidjarski, came to the Slovenian house.
The Court then assessed the effort of which he built from a small instrumentary campaign in the Czech Scale Company with a billion drives.
"I can say that assessment has not only encouraged me, but all my cooperation and has increased our self-consciousness for the threat of competition," says the remote winner today.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, Farmet wanted to do something beneficial.
So when the state offered to the father Karla Gidjarski to purchase a little salary as a compensation for communists a funny property, he did not weight, he refused the career in the company where he worked at that time, and with a couple of friends around his father founded a company on a plastic van.
Soon they started specializing on plant oil lists.
After eighteen years, they became the biggest producer of automatic woods in Central Europe.
More information has been made between the unfair public after success in the competition of media.
"Not only our customers started to mark Farmet very better, but also the partners began to appreciate that they cooperated with a company that has achieved greater success in their country," Karel Žjararski said.
However, the past year was not only in Farmet, in the sign of the Euphory of Victory.
Assessment has resulted from the economic results of the company until 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of machinery goods.
The crisis that has not yet touched the citizens, but the companies have already stopped their investment projects and have started to limit the purchases of new machines and machines.
"It's obviously not too dismissed us."
"The markets decreased by 40 percent, we had to limit production, and it also came to leave," explains Karel Ždjarski.
The livestock company must sometimes be able to make such non-argumental measures.
But the situations have been able and the company has kept in profit, even if I'm less than before the crisis.
However, investment in research and development is not taken from Farmet.
"We have set a research and school center, we have strengthened the presentation on international areas, we have received the main assessment in home exhibitions," says Jedjarski.
Everything convinces that the crisis is behind them.
The applications will grow again and with them and the number of new employees.
"To the new victory I want a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel Gijarski says.
The survey that removes irrelevant rules
The year's Absurdit survey is a quarter part of the business detention.
Some uncertain rules have already been canceled.
The unfair victory of the next year's Absurdita survey has become the obligation to carry out documents to the office which are also available online officers.
She decided to do more than a third of the four thousand voters.
For example, the social security management requested a paper expression from the business register, although the officer can get it by two clicking on the mouse.
Thanks to the investigation, it's changing.
"The Czech social security administration already expressed from the business register in the controls of payers to require adequately," said the CSSZ speaker Jana Buranj.
Congratulation with all regulations and regulations which companies and businesses in Czechland must comply, and those insensitives to cancel them with the meaning of the competition of Absurdit year.
This year is a fourth part of the business of the organized economic newspapers, and between the public, it is still more pleasing.
If the votes were voting at approximately three thousand voters, they had four thousand voters for a year.
And there is no wonder that the most different legal obligations that serve only to maintain business are still enough and enough for us.
"Why we are in the world's front places for tax recognition," Karel Havlikč from the Association of Small and Central Business and Animals of the CR.
The simplification of undertakings has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison to the world, however, the Czech Republic does not improve, especially.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has placed on the 74th position, which is about eight places worse than the lone.
The competition of Absurdita was first announced in 2006 and runs annually according to the same scenario.
Increasing administrative and birocratic insights, any person can annually from April to the end of September when the conclusion of the concurrence.
To log in, the web address is www.firmaroku.cz After the competition editor will choose seven candidates on "anticine" and allows the public to vote on www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz in October.
Absurdita, who will get the most of the votes of winning.
More than a hundred, more accurately 105 rules and regulations were notified in the annual investigation.
The guys sent businessmen, but also professional unions and journalists.
The "finalists" competites, for example, between the nominated, a request that vehicles for the maintenance of remote and employment roads pay slowly or that employees with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms are drawn every two years.
The list of seven years of age is published on the competition pages.
The statement of the competition running at the beginning of November in the Vaclav Place of Prague is part of the hapenning, which is regularly the personality of political and social life.
In this year, for example, in this concurrence, Eva was assisted by the Officer of the Association of Small and Mediterranean and Animals of CAR or Peter Kužel, President of the Economy Community.
"The economic prosperity can't work where the stage is to the undertakers under the feet, therefore it's my goal to cancel at least three ten paragraphs, which are actually inevitably complicating business," said the Minister of Industrie and Trade to Martin Kocourek.
It does not appear to be empty.
In 2007, the obligation of employee to notify three days before the animal authority in the place where a permanent operation is located, the purpose of remaining on the exhibition or simply.
This obligation was removed by the new animal law.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was notified by the Office of work for its employee's service road by up to 30 days, was removed by the law on such a green card.
And to the third of all right.
In the absurd year 2009, the physiotherapeutics were made to have a large look, a coat and two weights.
This was quiet in the year of the Department of Health - the obligation to have a leather has fallen.
The new category evaluates the company's responsibility
Assessments are ecological, humanitary, educational or sport projects.
The news in the year of the five-year competition of the financial newspaper is a category called the Responsible Company 2010.
Sending this competition is a support for a reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support firms that take into account the impacts of their business on life and support Community responsibilities," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional mobile operator manager, Vodafone firms, which is the reporter and the guarantee of competition as in the case of a concurrence on a year's rebel.
In the first year of 2010, this special subcategory of the principal competition of Vodafone Company has been registered by companies who have not been successful in the business for this only purpose.
The story of each of them is very inspired and would be issued to a single article.
Although the subject of its activity is diameterly different, their joint denominators can be considered support and consideration.
In one case, it is related to affected people, such as personal problems or health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen whole-republic finalists, such as the Prague Software Society Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sport teams between employees who then have a variety of tournaments in different sports.
Another example of the responsibility company from Pardubian country is Isolit-Bravo, which is the main contributor of the sponsored child sponsor.
As regards its health-consequent employee, the paper of Podébrad has more than 70 per cent, so it has received the title of the Mediterranean Responsible Company and in the competition of Vodafone Firma of the year has been placed in the country as a third.
On Olomo_ku, MiRyz Soft, who has taken a job for a period of time, also reduced by average 35 hours a week, but without a relatively reduced payment.
The Title also granted it because it was primarily purchasing from the Chinese producers, supporting civil activities in the nearby area and safe lives.
"We are trying to recycle as far as our business and our administration have the least impact on life," explains Milushe Riznar.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Usteck country thinks again of the health of its employees and has organized their ergonomic chairs and keyboards to each notebook, supports their work from home and uses the catering services provided by a local protected long.
"In addition, we support the opinion of a man in pressure that helps specifically the local community of Rome," says the representative of the company Ondrej Suki.
In the following order, Prania’s activity and cleaning from the Carlovar country, which contributes to their employees in the form of superstandard bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We give back contributions to food, transport, increased employment and recreation," Joseph Strač said from the Bruntal Building Company of Czasch, winning in Mo’sskoslez country.
In the Category of the Annual Responsible Company, all national finalists of Vodafone Firma were automatically registered, who answered the questionnaire attached to the register and sent it later until 15 August.
Incorrect or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were then exhausted from the evaluation officer.
"When the representatives of the competitive company did not answer the question, they could not participate in the Competition of the Responsible Company, but they were not dismissed from the "vodafone Company" competition of the year."
"In this competition only is not possible, because this is the subcategorie of the primary Company," explains Karel Goldman from the Bison & Rose Agency.
At the Earth Fund, the Police in Plzni was arrested in public competition.
In the building of the Earth Fund in Plzni, the anti-corupt police in the past days.
Iron detectives have placed a local business officer in the Media Sfera and a businessman with the realities of Luboši G.
It was evident that he tried to manipulate the current public competition in order to make the land offered in competition a particular interested person.
He had to pay a half a million crown for that.
"I can only confirm that the police is on one person for the violation of the penalty at the public prohibition and on the public competition," said the Executive Boss of the Pleasing State Representative of Antonia Greena, which could not provide further details in view of the continuing investigation.
The sixty-five-year-old police officers missed freedom after 24 hours.
The way the public concurrence could be affected is only speculated in view of the minimum of official information.
The Mountain of the Earth Fund Lubomira Black on the Question of the Right stated that they were attracted at a divorced workplace in the Place Police, which was during the public concurrence.
"It was about a client, not our employee," she explained.
The public competition, according to the Black, has the right name "A call for the delivery of the offer for transfer of lands in accordance with the ground law" and is undertaken when the offered land is interested in more authorised applicants.
"These persons shall offer a higher value of their refund refunds to be made by the transfer than the land value has been declared."
"Subject to the proposed claims, the order of purchasers and the Earth Fund will then transfer the earth to the person who offered the highest debt," explained the speaking fund.
Liboš G. obviously had information about who has been registered in the challenge, and because he is also a legal person, because he has purchased a number of refunds, he has offered to the interesters of the land that competition is not participating.
It's clearly incased the deficiencies for it.
That would explain that he had so much money in holding.
Luboš G. had superstandard contacts on PF in Plzni in the past.
He figured in the case of an ex-Cheef PF Václav Sankot, who was penaltyly charged with the refund of the land, which has already been issued on the location of the building.
At that time, Luboš G. received from the Fund, for example, the land intended to build public communications, particularly in the place where the courts were to be built in the industrial area of Burska.
He has changed it very well with the magistrate at home in the historical center of the city, which had a much higher value.
At that time, she had to join it because it would be dangerous by blocking the building.
Homes of residence pay hundreds per month
Homes will have to pay not only for all kinds of energy since January, but also for water and accommodation, warm supplys and somewhere grows and resources.
The families will have to get out of money from January to hundreds of crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity delivers up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 per cent less than tenth in some cities you will have to pay for water supplys and too many subtracts to the supply of central heat.
Electrical delivery should be household in the apartments each year on the road stocoron than now.
However, the prices of electricity have decreased all the main suppliers, thus there is a significant increase in energy production support from renewable resources, particularly photographics.
Although the gas produces quietly, however, in the time when people are most heated and have the highest need.
Therefore, each year, it must also be calculated by hundreds of crowns further.
While electricity and gas delivers throughout the Republic, the changes in the prices of central exhausts are different in place.
Increasing prices are planned primarily foreigners.
For example, households in Pardubians or the Royal Games will pay from January for a center of about 50 crowns per month, more than 1000 crowns per year pay the family in Liberia.
The people of Prague are again threatening that more than 9 per cent of them is training water and costly, and that is where the city increases the rental from the infrastructure.
It's not changed, it's added to Place 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will remain in the whole Republic comparison between lower.
On the north of Czech, where the prices already belong to the highest, it has a water and assets of 7.4 per cent.
For example, the price of payment can be increased in 450 thousand rental apartments, where the regulation ends since January.
For example, CPI Byty, which has approximately 2500 apartments in Ustí, decided to increase up to 100 percent from January.
Those who agree with a new higher premium will decide to give the company to the court.
Regulated premiums paying people in about 300 thousand apartments may increase to 10 per cent next year.
Czech kids drink fernet and rum. The beer is out of the mode, it's slow.
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally and better whisky stealed to parents.
These are the drinks after which the drinks are most often finished in the care of the doctors who have not yet been 15 years of drinking.
There are no kids who are treated in the hospital repeatedly.
This results from the experience of doctors who face similar cases in children’s hospital division.
"No beer or wine are completely unnecessary because it takes time before you drink them."
"Trendem is certainly a strong alcohol," reported the Right Child Primary of the Hospital Hospital in the Central Czech People Pelikan.
"When they get out of the box, it's about whisky, otherwise, but it's overwhelming the fernet and water."
"The wood has the advantage that he's getting to the jews and then not to feel so much," explained the primary.
And for the truth, the speaker also gives him the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurin.
"The most often it's fernet or rum."
"It's modern alcohol today, especially at basic schools."
"In some cases, it was about the slip that they brought from home," said Jurin.
According to Pelikan's primes, 13 or 14 years of age are drinks on a relatively running income.
Before Horo, where he worked since the year, he worked ten years just on the pediatries in Motole, where healthy schools are discussed in a wide range of schools.
"One girl at us lied about four times."
"The carrier started in 12 years when it was brought to us with 3,5 mile of alcohol in the blood in combination with extase," the doctor described particularly a serious case.
"There was at the show in Holesovia on a dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't even come especially out that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," wondered the primary.
Just not interesting parents or even their significant tolerance to drink their own descendants is considered as a major cause of growing child drinking.
However, it is not possible to speak about dependence in the right word of the meaning, according to professionals in children.
"Alcoholic understands a few-year-old chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena that belongs to it, and that's not in children."
"In those who use alcohol repeatedly, there is more significant family-social background," explained Primary Pelikan.
According to the speaker Jurin’s year at the Motole pediatric clinic, some 40 drinking children were hospitalized in half November.
However, only those with the hard toxicity that had to stay in the hospital will have to be reached.
Children's drinks, who carry their parents after ambulant treatment, are, if possible, carrying the police home, they're not counted anywhere.
In addition to the cases when children sit soon after school and drink a lack of corners, there are three seasonal trainings that can be found in Pelikan: magro, Silvestr and the end of the school year.
"It's gonna be sing of a bad testimony, or they're celebrating the beginning of the empty day."
"Now, I lived on a magazine of seven children's drinkers once," Pelikan advised.
The drinker who takes the night of detoxication under the supervision of the doctors is paradoxally in advantage of the one who suffers inappropriate coffee on the other day.
The early head pain caused by dehydration and the lack of glucose is caused by glucose infuses with glucose and animals missing the body.
"They're actually better on it because they're having a beautiful dinner and a good awake and they're nothing ill."
"They're only a disappointment of where they are," Pelikan admitted that sometimes he'll defeat patients at least the costs that their treatment requested.
The transport of health and hospitalization on the acute bed will also come to tens of thousands of crowns.
"I sometimes applied it as a student when I calculated exactly the kids at the visit, how much their beauty was standing, and that they could also spen the whole year on the brigade to make a party," added Pelikan.
However, health insurance is not accessible in children’s drinking cases.
Two airports L-159 are first in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 airports from the total five cooks, for which the Czech Defence Minister exchanged the transport airport Casa C-295M, went to Spanish Sevilla on Tuesday, where the Casa - EADS airport manufacturer was sitting.
It's the first thing that this type of machines appeared in the property of someone else than the Czech Armies.
In the neighborhood, they were only on practices or overseers years.
This is a double version of L-159T1, which has yet been conducted by the Czech Army and which were aircraft.
The remaining three machines are unique L-159.
They are still reserved in Aeru Vodochoda and the negotiator - Omnipol - has taken them last week.
When the aircraft is exposed from Vodochod, it is not known, according to Jana Pejska from the Defence Committee.
"The only L-159 airports for exchange were collected from the time of the aircraft saved, without other investments and investments from the resort of the Ministry."
"Double places L-159T1 have been changed in the current state and image," said the Right of Pejšek.
He added that the army would not remain without two-years because the Ministry signed with Aer Vodochoda in May 2009 with a value of 200 million crowns to convert four unnecessary machines L-159 to two double machines.
One new aeroplane took the army in July, the second moves to the end of the year.
According to Peiska, the EADS was committed to the aircraft to the arms of some alian countries.
"It is said that the L-159 aircraft is the EADS company and will serve to train pilots from the NATO country."
"It is therefore a retracting thing in what way this thing will be done," said Peeschek.
For example, the Spanish Army of L-159 has no interest.
Five L-159 for one airport Casa and purchasing three other years in 3.5 billion crowns approved the government of Mirka Topolánka.
The Defence Minister did not buy election and directly claimed the EADS.
The current defence leader argumented that the changes would support the future exports of L-159 to the defence.
The Czech Army bought 72 machines from Aera and used only 24, the rest would want to sell.
Casa's aeroplane buying will probably have a courtyard.
The Czech Defence Ministry also demanded the European Court because the aircraft should be chosen on the basis of a European trend and not on the celebration of one producer.
The army has already taken three aeroplanes in Casa, and the last time, Kbely's airport would have to fly for fourteen days.
Longer indicator than rings means lower risk of cancer
Men who have indicators longer than rings are exposed to a smaller risk of disease cancer of prostitute.
This is a surprising conclusion of the study that the British Cancer magazine published in the middle.
It can be related to the level of the man's testosteron hormone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of cancer cancer, especially for men up to 60 years," announced a joint study of Ros Eeles, professor Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger can thus be helped to determine who men should be tested on prosecution cancer, especially in combination with genetic risks or other threatening factors such as family health burden, added Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she followed more than 1500 patients with prostitute cancer and simultaneously over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the studies had indicators on the right hand shorter than the rings.
She paid for them the same probability of the cancer of prostitution as for 19 percent of those whose fingers were equally long.
However, in the case of those who had a higher indicator than the rings, this risk was decreased by 33 percent, for men to 60 per cent, even 87 per cent.
The proportion of the length of two mentioned fingers - created during the preat period - obviously reflects the different levels of sexual hormones that the child has been exposed in the workshop.
Less than testosteron corresponds to the longer indicator.
Earlier research showed that testosteron just supports the growing prostatic cancer.
The former Czech genetic and former President Academy, Professor Václav Pačes, said that he knows about this study running, but it does not seem that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer would be "completely shown".
Czech is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, as in Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday.
On the streets and roads, the snow is mostly covered, and the roads have passed on many places all night.
The distance D5 is closed between 89 and 93 km in the direction of Divorce for several accidents of cost and personal cars and also stands D1 at Brna in the direction of Prague.
In the news, the Center Car Club Divisioner (UAMK) said that.
The truck was 91 miles [91 km], and the 93 miles [93 km] was coming into two cost cars, and the accident requested a hurt.
Some personal cars were also completed in the cup.
The problems are also on the D1 distance to 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks arrived there.
The drivers should sit near Brn at 190 km or go through Brno and then travel to 182 km to Kivalce.
There's a few kilometers of columns.
It's also a accident at D11 remote, and it's just at the coming to Prague.
In Prague there are several meters of snow, the temperatures indicate minus seven degrees Celsia.
Columns of cars, for example, are created on the Prosecu, also stumbled in Sterboholska.
The most simple transport weather is metro.
Tramways run lately, for example, on the trace between Karl’s destination and the Mirror.
At the eighth is to replace the Prague Crisis Chapter.
The problems are also covered by railways and aircraft.
The Czech roads have already been broken by snow to break seven vatick connections.
The problems, for example, have a trace from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
The travellers should control the current operation.
The Russian airport was closed from the middle of 11 hours night to five to five.
The majority of the roads to the South Moravia are already stumbled, but only increased care.
In Estonia there are three nearby roads, the places of snow languages in Brinsk and in Blancland are necessary to make some communications at the top places of snow rows.
The most achieved places belonged to Wyskovsko.
Today there are closed roads: Ruusínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Charatice - Milešo.
They'll have to put freshness in their clothes.
When they are transferred, they can't be reviewed yet.
Hodonin needs caution in the White Carpat.
On roads that are maintained there for protection of nature only by inert poessy, there is five metres of snow.
In Czechland, there were two to ten meters of snow, mostly in North Czech, often to 18 meters.
In Mo's Scossland, some 15 meters of snow attacked.
The destruction in Czech is gradually delayed.
American soldiers have a new "speed weapons"
The American Army set a new "speed" weapon in Afghanistan, known at the same time under the XM-25 code label.
Generals hope that the new automatic weapon or dark conflict with Taliban and "changing game" in their benefits.
The new weapon is something like a little super-case work.
Its designs also indicate the lazer with precision for a few meters.
Specific rate of 25 mm developed for this gun and which contains highly explosive marketing, actually works as small granates.
Bads can be programmed so that they will explode not only when they get to the goal, but at any point their balistic roads.
They can therefore be used against an enemy who is hidden by an interruption, wall or in the burst.
So Shara is not usually protected, and when the murderous rain of the oceans rises to it, it can get it out of the battle.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of XM-25, the new weapons are the first weapons for the pig, which use "smart".
"The boy with her is in principle so that he finds the goal, sends him a laser paper, which determines the distance, so he gets a clear intentional point, according to which he adjusts the proposal and makes the couch."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you press the puzzle, the weapon will be shoot and switch up a 543 meter away plus minus one, two or three meters," said Audette.
Transfers to 400 workshops
The Concern Fujits moves his bathroom from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees move their job in July of the next year from the successful administration of buildings to the Marienbader site in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Concern of Fujits moves his bathroom from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As in the middle of the middle of the gigant, specialized on computers and their maintenance, it moves 400 men and women in July of the next year instead of a successful administration of the building in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administration complex in Lyon Street, part of Frankfurt called Nederrad.
According to the statement of the speaker Fujistu, there should be another 100 other workshops, which are yet divided in the region, at the time of monitoring.
The payment offer was often very attractive and large space offices in Astro Park, thinking that more works in the way of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujits was just in charge.
The competent actor Bernd Wagner said, "We found a central seat in Frankfurt-Nederrad with excellent infrastructure."
Excellent aircraft connection is just a global company such as Fujits very important.
The recent movement of the important undertaking in the region led to joy in winners and disappointment in vulnerable people yesterday.
The main economic reporter in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that it was possible to get a global player.
It's a fantastic demonstration of confidence in this place.
Fujits seems to go to the city, the seat is an important impulse for Nederrad.
Starsta Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Green), complained with the decision of Fujits.
The city was now informed by the leadership of the company about its purpose.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," Corwis said.
Friendship contacts but could not change the challenges of the computer manufacturer with the winner of inability at the Marienbader location.
In the outcome, the economic divisions were determining.
Now it is to prevent long non-obsession in such a prominent place.

Amazon disables the server - discharges against Assangem
Wikileaks gets to the heavy.
The Amazon Internet Service disabled its servers of discovery platform.
This may have occurred on political pressure after the publication of the statistics of the secret diplomatic departure.
The founder Wikileaks Assange seems to be held in Britain.
Wikileaks, a discovery platform, is obtained in the United States under further pressure.
The Internet activists have lost access to their basic home server in America and are now looking for the Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, the prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman invited other countries and businesses to bought Wikileaks.
And the founder Wikileaks Julian Assange, led on the list searched by Interpol, must be maintained according to one newspaper in Britain.
"Wileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free pronouncement in the country of freedoms", they announced activists to publish the service of short Twitter messages in the middle (local time).
Shortly before, the Amazon Internet company found Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used to publish secret diplomatic depths of Amazon Web Service (AWS) to enable high number of access to documents.
The Twitter service explained Wikileaks to this step: "Fain - our dollars now we will lose by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with free expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of his servers for Wikileaks after collaborating with Senator Joe Lieberman, the CNN television station published on the basis of the information of the Liverman office.
The president of the Senate Committee for the Defence of the House threatened Amazons with a boykot, informed the British Guardian.
"I would like Amazon to approach this step earlier, in view of the previous publication of classified information on Wikileaks," said Senator.
Liverman invited himself to prevent a platform in the use of servers, even in the rest of countries.
"Wikileaks is one illegal, irrespectable and independent, and this is our national security, which threatens life on the whole planet," reported in one statement of the non-lateral senator.
"No responsible company - or American or commercial - should not Wikileaks help in their efforts to expand the stolen material."
The founder Wikileaks Assange, who is searched by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of violence, is on the list searched by Interpol.
On the basis of the report in the London newspapers The Indiat, the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, Scotland Yard seems to know the exact place.
The Internet activist mentioned an investigation in Sweden for the intrices of his anti-equipment.
The speaker Wikileaks Christinn Hrafnsson in London said that it had even happened to the exhibitors.
"There were even the challenges to kill Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is rightly afraid of his security, said Hrafnsson.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to the announcements from North America.
In America, the former republican Årkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested to be a responsible person for the publication of Wikileaks because of the betrayal.
In Canada, one adviser of the Government of Stephen Harper said in television - a pattern of ironic, Assange should be killed and Obama could use the "destination plane".
Meanwhile, the White House and Assange's vocabulary shooter was divorced.
The speaker of the American president Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called "smile and absurd" that Assange requested a remission in ministerial service for Hillary Clinton, if it was responsible for recently published Spanish calls to diplomates.
"I'm not absolutely sure why we're interested in the view of one person with the web pages," Gibbs said.
"Our policy and interests of this country are much more important than its websites."
The US Government now examines the safety of its databases.
A special confidence was appointed by the representative of the Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Travers, communicated with the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of the "necessary reforms in the structure" which are necessary after publishing messages from the sending to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review how the whole government exchanges and protects information.
The US Government also notified that it wants to ensure the security of dissidents and activists if they should be in danger because of the publication of Wikileaks.
"We've made everything and we've been contacted with them," said the speaker's officer Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them if it was necessary."
Frozen University
For "Gelato" in Bolona, frozen sugars are prepared for a better annual period.
The basic course for the future frozens, which takes three days, is a great interest and visitors come from the world.
Where do you actually take the frozen?
From Gelatare and Gelataio.
Gelatiere, Czechish, a little old frozen, produces a crom according to all the rules of the Italian frozen art.
Gelataio produces a fridge of the cold box, he's cut it into the sales and sells it.
To try this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to learn more about the frozen, he will not escape the "Gelato-University" Italian Carpigiani company.
In 2003, the manufacturer of frozen machines made a frozen university to meet the frozen from its machines in all the high Italian ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is a huge interest and visitors come from the world.
However, several days of special chocolate frozen and practice are also offered in their own freezing.
Someone wants to have a new career in his Midlife-Crisis, other people are focusing on the heavy ice of their unexpected complaints.
This time, 40 of the 19 countries of all the worldwide - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art artist from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the Ice-Cream industrial country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business conservant, and she wants to start something from her own after years of stress.
Two young Egyptians are dreaming that they will cover the frozen in Cairo.
One male in Malta and one in Brazil wants to improve the quality of the frozen in their bars - and the Canadian woman in the house of Julia, because her children love Italian frozen.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal property of perfect frozenness.
Determining is not just a good pleasure, but also a famous heaven and a good conscience.
Luciano will not forget during his schooling in the Southern and ownership trigger on the tower: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it is still a novel romantic dose."
By step of production it seems to be very simple.
Luciano puts the basic rules of milk, swimming, milk, sugar and stabilisers in a large mixer, which burns all by a electron program at 85 degrees and then soon colds at four degrees.
Then it turns on a couch and runs a pasterised white basic crown, based on all kinds of milk frozens.
Immediately the student is questioned: Is it possible to produce frozen only from natural substances without stabilising?
How can a person experiment himself?
Luciano's warning, keeping the spirit to the unknown.
He who speaks of the frog "only from natural vessels", obviously used the same stabilisators - most of the natural products, such as the guar moke of guarrine.
Of course, it is possible to produce freezing, even without stabilizers, but it must be sold during one day, elsewhere, and the customer eats itself.
Certain variations of base weight are allowed.
It's more increasingly with aromatic essences.
The Master Luciano distinguishes in the cut of frozens according to the adjudication that is purchased in the supermarket, either in the fruit-section or in the sugar division.
Besides, there are powder and cream.
"The suppliers will try to introduce a lot of aromatised vessels."
"You should just experiment."
Be with fruit sorbits with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or they will be frozen from white base weight that will change the cups to yellow crom and cocain based on all the chocolate tests.
Now, it's a more cool course to freezing machines.
Luciano is allowed to produce four different species of vanil, chocolate, coffee and liscoory frozens - either with sheep or without them in the basic material, with more or less vanyl aromat or other natural arrangements.
The same experiment will be carried out with fruit-freeding species.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pire - as a result of cutting it is not better.
Liscoorea frozen doesn't have to cut more oil when it contains more olive oil.
The favorite frozen from kiwi will produce a group that will use more fruit, less water and a little less stabilisator.
Once a mixed mixture rises correctly, he says Luciano.
The freezing vial is a clear floor task: If brake pire is used with a lot of sugar, the part of the sugar in the basic recept must be reduced.
For citron frozens, extra sugar portion needs.
Luciano produces a device that specifies the contents of sugar in fruit (which means the wine of horrors).
Fortunately, tables make the numbers easy.
The furnace of freezing no longer requires so many physical muscles as before.
It does not only support the device for the automatic production of the basic weight.
There is also a device that is prepared for freezing mixture at the same time cuts into the chrome and covers the minimum temperature.
Even though we're automatically getting out of small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will also spare himself and his colleagues from the down to the fruitful pire when he gets out of the control of a huge mixer.
"In every course," the Master Luciano believes, "is just the question of the time when something like this happens."
Reviewers in two lights
The European Food Authority of the EFTA is conducted with a industrial experiment with genetic plants.
This accusation has now stated a group of testbiotech experts, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of bioe results.
"It sounds like a spiklenic theory, but we have documented it well," he said in the middle of Mnich's testbiotech Christoph then.
The leading group of Efsa experts for geneticly modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and the other expert Efsa has already been associated with the lobbys of Illi for several years.
This is financed by a concert such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has participated in the EIF's control rules for genetic plants and thus stands in the centre of interests, then criticizes.
It appears that the EFSA provisions are in accordance with the whole paragraphs of the Illi documents and take the manuals of the industry which should be controlled by the Authority of the Italian Parm.
It's already based on what Testbiotech warns of interest.
Recently, a high manager from the Ephesus has passed without any time or transitional time to the Swiss Agricultural Concern Syngenta - and thus has changed the parties.
The vote for Central Germany (MDR) has also recently discovered the EU-Agency's personal connection to the control of industrial lobby, which has encouraged the interest of the Ministry of Life Affairs as well as the EU's commitments.
Meanwhile, the Ephesus can't solve interests.
It works with all series of data, thus those in the industry, if they are highly qualified, are listed in one statement.
Professors who work for the Ephesus do not require that they have no contact with the idea.
But he needs to put them in.
Kuiper recognizes his work for International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
Only it is marked as an neutral forum of professionals from ιea, industrial and policy - other than for the risk assessment of bio-e without the lobby.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that genetic plants are currently allowed to be modified in animals without any trial of feeding, and that genetic plants reactions on the effects of life-effect are not affected.
"We want to know what, for example, will make geneticly changed sugar on the field," he says.
The current practice is only testing isolated whites and not the entire genetic plant, which does not coherent results.
"If they don't look for risks, how would it be possible to find them?", she asked complaints then.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The scientist worker has examined a gender since 1994 and currently works at the Technical High School in Curych.
In this area, the industry is trying to be more influenced or discredited in Europe as well as in the United States.
That is why there are almost no people who would not be associated with concerts.
Most of them do not publish studies that are critical for companies.
"Intelligence controls security research," Hillbeck believes.
Stone Track
Uli Gsell also arranged the same, totally 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening, he stood in front of the shopping in Stuttgart, the tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It's snow.
The story is known: In September, the bags came and began to take a large north wheel.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21, a billion decreasing of injury.
When the building was stopped, the wings were lying in the traces.
Divorced by 6000, 7000 cuss.
The wave from the ́ilsheim, a mild groomed stone used in the years 1914 and 1920.
Gsell's a coach in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's trying to get a few of these bits.
"These stones are relics."
"He can't disappear."
"The poor and poor stone, simple and purple."
When one cut off, he smoked the cigarette smoke.
What's going to do with those bags, she doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
Stuttgart's stone track leads to the forest at Tübingen at the former deposit of the French Army municipious, where Manuel Rong built his stone roof.
44-year-old man's trading with old stones.
He bought all those who came up during the bouring in Stuttgart.
"It would be a disgrace if they were slaughtered or disappeared at the depony," she says in her office, a tree building, which was a previous guarding house.
They tell him that they gave him and threatened him when in September all newspapers he was buying the rest of the north wheel from the company who is carrying out democracy.
But he spoke all the days with S-21.
And he explained to them that the democracy can't be.
And when it comes, it's the most understanding when the stones continue to use.
Then it took about 200 S-21-contrasts each one of about 80 kilograms a heavy block, price for 6,50 to 14 euros.
As an eclipse, some of them also have the chance of returning it to the re-exposition.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a cost of 25 large cost cars.
Some half is still in the woods, the rest has been sold a long time.
Gardens, national gardens, housebuilders.
They came from all the angles and took away what happened to the cup and to the cup.
Stuttgart's spot stones have been changed to "wears" or as the border of the beaches.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't that political thing."
He's sitting in his territory car and walking on a walk after his 20th hectare kingdom.
He studied before the law, the study interrupted, posted the biologic, then asked for the computer and finally became a stone trademan.
And the lovers of stones.
There's 40,000 tons of stones.
He considers his stocks from all Germany.
He says he's the biggest businessman with old stones in the Republic.
Hurry.
The snow is located in the art.
"They looked at the Marien-most in the Guardians," he says.
The sand from Labe, yellow, heavy, heavy.
"My favorite stone."
Let's go on the way up through the woods.
It shows the chrome: the red sandwich, the first part of the railway in Karlsruhe.
Come on.
"Speak travertin."
Once the quarters were in the Neckarstadion court in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow is stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police president in Stuttgart, red playing from the temple of Sankt Blasien, the tuf from the hospital in Heilbron.
What a job, what a trip, how a road.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were broken manually and transported by simple ships and busy transports, it becomes totally honest.
"It would be a scandal if something like that had been lost."
He hasn't been rich, very rich no longer.
Today, however, a stone trademan employs 14 people, and besides the woods, stones have been placed in the woods, one rock, one board, one wooden and one jardin.
"We're working firmly, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the rest.
It's going to go to Collin at the watch time.
They'll save the stones there too.
Battle of talents for high potentials
There's a lot of people in the distress.
16 students are pressured in loss breads, race powder and sweetness.
The Technical University in Braunschweg and the manufacturers of the cars of Volkswagen invited students to workshop machinery and design.
Along with the VW developers here, you have to talk about the car of future - and just likewise to know Volkswagen.
Many fires are trying to work with the most intelligent heads, like the VW company, to succeed and work in cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: What may be the most hopeful solutions in the auditors before they get to the market work and other interests in them.
Since university does not issue any list of success of its students, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in projects oriented on practice and get them.
On TU Braunschweig, the car concert is trying to get talents on the second day.
One young lady from the personal division sells owns, gums and tables with VW logs.
It relates to young talents about practical programmes, student employment and indicates their ways to the concert.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of a project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both parties: "The students will get into contact with the industrial and get experience."
"WW can know students at the same time, draw closer to interesting candidates and think who would think of a partnership."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is that he's so busy fighting for students.
"It was rather a major professional project," says Selle.
The battle for fresh solvency is probably stronger.
In many sectors, firms cannot choose their employees from long-term representatives.
Instead, it must strive and try to deal with particularly highly disabled work.
A greater engineering resolution has a excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Engineers' Square, VDI remained in October 40,000 unincluded engineer positions.
And according to VDI, the lack of engineers is still growing.
The KPMG auditing and advisory company is a Roman Dy's chain of talents.
Organizes special recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a type of modern treasure for the treasure where the participants need to find the path according to GPS coordination.
The company plans to send these eight promised students to the United States next year.
Participants can, at the same time, watch KPMG-shops and contact the company.
Previously, two choice rounds will be decided who will be.
Only Crème de la Crème from a lot of interested people fly to the United States.
In the context of high potentials at universities, they will pay more laws according to Dykty.
"We want to distinguish our Race from the rest."
"It was very little for us. "
It seems that the hunter of the talents of Dy has happiness.
"We have stayed in contact with all the participants of the similar action last year."
"Some of us will finish the study soon, and they're planning to take care of our job," he says.
In addition to direct celebration on the campus with particularly small and medium-sized enterprises present classics on the work markets.
"We're trying to contact the resolutions on professional exhibitions."
"As for example, Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, leading the personal division of Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
Bonn's company works around 1500 employees in Germany.
She knows the problem with young jobs.
Currently, 35 places are written on the websites of the company.
"In the present time, it's just complicated to occupy free spaces."
"They're worth a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact through professionals at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with different high schools, such as the University of Freeberg.
"Professors inform us that we can do practice or write diplomatic work."
The solar specialist does not organize any dear advertising action.
Instead, the company is trying to make other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"The large concerts often can't offer it," says the leader of the Stübe's personal division.
In searching for work, money is no longer a major role.
Flexible work; time, children's care, or good options of procedure are other determining factors.
Solarworld was in a study of the Great Place Institute to Work 55. place between 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute shall set up an annual list of the best German employees.
Furthermore, the cooperation of the employees is asked about how they are satisfied with their work and their work and follow the workshops.
The leader of the Stübe personal division hopes that he will bring points on her location to the employees.
"I think the staff are particularly informed about the external assessments of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Re日 Warler from German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good news strategy as employee.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means primarily internal measures.
"The best way to be seen as an attractive employee leads through its own employees," he says.
This is professionally called the Internal Employer Branding, thus the marketing of employees in their own employees.
"The pleasure of employees is the best senders."
When the company cares well about his people and they identify themselves with the company, then they will make their employee advertising from themselves.
"It's like a game with a cargo," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new wheels
During the following years, they will not escape from the province of the United States of Florida in the Mexican valley of the new wild garden.
The government in Washington has issued a corresponding prohibition - and that has cancelled the previous plans with the end of validity.
Also before the Atlantic coast, new gardens are banned.
Inside Minister Ken Salazar told it in the middle.
D · a bitter prohibition to pay for at least five years is the explosion on the garden "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before this unfortunate trial, which was one-thousands of the employees' lives and led to the biggest disaster of life in the United States, President Barack Obama signed on the pressure of opposition and his willingness to allow new gardens in the eastern part of the Mexican valley.
This is why the staff are trying to reduce the United States dependencies on the supply of foreign pigs.
There is no significant explanation of who is responsible for the destruction of the oil tomb in the valley.
The middle of the criticism is the British Energy Concern BP, which is confronted with billion requests.
The investigation committee, which Obama has confidenced, should present outcomes during the conference.
In October, the inside minister Ken Salazar rejected the prohibition of returns that he paid since the explosion.
They subsequently delivered different farming concerts for new garden purposes.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters from severe controls and strike security rules.
At present, the control authority is mainly reformed, which has warned for many corruption accusations.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would distort the lucracy of the possibilities of tax outcome for the agricultural and gas concerts.
The industry now is openly warning that more heavy regulations are mainly reduced by the volume of the weight of the grid.
"Government plans are the biggest fresh for the growth of gas and electrical industry," the result of the current investigation in the BDO advisory company in the campaign - still before the prohibition of return to the centre.
The American Energy Alliance is still trying to do this for inconvenience in the district: "No one knows exactly what regulations will change."
Investment in new weight projects will be placed up to the revocation of growth.
The area of Ogoni was burned
The waters in the rivers are oil hedge, it is like pumps: billions of litres of sole rivers have destroyed the nature of Ogoni in Nigeria.
People live by stealing, corruption, and illegal covering of the floor.
Celestine Akpobari thinks that well.
"Don't touch," says the journalists of the ecological activist, "that's going to be done before the objectivity still enough of the bathroom."
The 37-year Nigerian followed the trying to photograph the boy who was shiping through the thick water that surrounded the snows: this scene acts in the watersheet with almost colors to be beautiful.
It's not that it's not to see under the blue wheat of the river.
Earlier, she gathered to us enough garnel, she told Esther Badom at the edge of Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slow flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large quantity of the floor was cut into a huge whale from the broken leadership.
Fisheries from the nearby town of Bodo must fall at least six hours to get into the water where fish are:• Ogoni, which is in the heart of the Niger River Delta, belongs to one of the worst dead in the world.
The road through the Mangro’s river with many side streams is just a famous whole range of starting.
The engine on the stone washs the place of the light water, and whose hand is thrown into the water, the fingerprints will be cut out.
The roots of the mangros are running out of the land as black dots of medicine, rarely providing palms allows its sheets to dream.
We are married to look for birds that are running in the walls: When the engine is quiet on the floor, it is deceived in the earliest place, where it burns as in the pumps, a terrible silence.
"What is playing here is the ecological leading of the war," Celestine Akpobari sadly says: "We live in constant health fear."
Comparison with war is authorised.
The area of occupation of Ogoni is the bite field where there is a few decades of fight: over 60 years ago, the first purchasers from Europe were included here, here in the 80s, the first decline was created by the Ken Saro-Wiwa writer, here Shell was to stop its production in 1993 because it was very dangerous for employees.
Today, the company must not return to Ogoni: while it is daily heavy from the whole delta with three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5000 weighty gardens and 7000 km leading more than two million black gold bars, the field is located in Ogoni with the boat, for the concern, this is very sustainable.
Each hundreds of meters are running out of the water of the ocean as the bizarre sockets: "Birthwoods", so that it is very nearly called the head of the garden opens.
They're 50 years old, they're incredible to the sea.
Each minute, the head of the garden opening will be broken, it reports to Akpobari, and then runs the constant pump of the river into the water.
According to the estimates of experts, the ecosome was in delta more than two billion litres in 50 years: Any year such quantity of rivers flowed into the sea at Alaska at the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" havier 21 years ago - one of the largest life disasters in the history of mankind.
They have a conflict that is responsible for the continuing environmental disaster.
While Shell's concern marks the sabotage and organized robbery for more than 90 percent of pollution, it speaks of life protectioners about the covering heads of gardens and unfortunate leaders as the main reason.
Shell requires in Nigeria much less security provisions than in the world's growth, called a concert in 2008, Richard Ste: Only a quantity of injury on leads is "no quantity of higher than any other".
On a place that looks out of the remote as abandoned, oil-speaked district under the wide sky, the ships are out of the mangros: they are completely called and up to the wheel of oil.
Under one of the many courts that are partially connected with the leading, partially libovolously spread through the land, fire burns: illegal small raffinery.
The roof is burning over the fire for a few hours, explains Michael, the leading group.
Before it goes out of the leading to a mysterious neck of benzine, puts the cap at the end of kerosin leading and finally of oil.
This means Michael and his four co-operators every day to four trials after 300 litres: "We're doing 34,000 Naira" -- about 22 dollars.
The population of Delta uses the chronic lack of weight of weight in the largest farming state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one raffination.
A mixed low price of EUR 40 cents per litre of oil can still be killed by illegal producers: because they have grace free.
It comes from "bunkers", which are bound to lead everywhere in Ogoni: according to experts, the Niger River Delta loses the country at least 16 million litres of the river daily.
But only a small part of temporaryly stored sugar is illegally advised: The largest part of the organized crime network, which also belongs to politics and high positions of military representatives, to dancers and sales it on the world market.
The debate of whether the populations have caused disasters and their injuries or a lax-like production, is considered that the Akpobari activist is a clear academic.
"If the fishing companies were not considered to be a farmer, and if they weren't perfectly destroying the fishermen's lifebase, it would not have been a sabotage or a stealing and illegal raffinery."
Meanwhile, the relationship of Ogoni is especially so disappointed with Shell that it seems to be only the decline of the concert: "There may be other nations as Chinese as better."
Michael is disappointed.
"The highest time to disappear," says the swallowed manufacturer.
"Every time the soldiers can come."
If a special military unit had found it, they were not threatened, but painful taxation.
Also, soldiers who come from the north of the country - like all the Nigerian - want to benefit from sugar.
"Then the damn thing got our land in all respects to the bottom," says Apobari.
The investigators discovered a dangerous building error in the A380 engines
A380 has apparently a great security force.
The investigators tried to watch a machine that has emerged, my building error, which could lead to "the disastrous accident of the engine".
The aircraft company Qantas wants to complain the engine manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, Qantas’ traveling airbus was apparently more happy than ever known: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority has discovered a big security force on certain machinery engines A380 in its investigations and now warns against my building error.
Perhaps the burden would have difficult results: on a single connection, the markets could be produced for the purpose of enforcement, this Thursday in the public declaration of the ATSB.
This could lead to the "catastrophical accident of the engine".
This is the engine made by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 flights.
Among them there is also a airbus from Qantas, who had to join nearly in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airport company now has committed legal steps against the British Turbine producer.
It revoked the complaint to the Australian Court of Justice in Sydney, which allows further legal measures against this company.
The leader of the company of Qantas Alan Joyce said his company would ask for an accident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released and the wearing areas were damaged.
Rolls-Royce marked because of the damage of burning.
After this event, it must be exchanged worldwide to 40 engines.
The Australian investigators notified that other aircraft safety tests were carried out, which are equipped with relevant engines.
The security recommendation is an outcome of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said speaker ATSB Martin Dolan.
The safety lack was considered sufficiently important to inform all of them about.
After the nuclear arrival, Qantas left the aircraft company in A380 for a few weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380 transitional land.
Airhansa changed in one A380 engine as security measures.
The biggest personal aircraft in the world.
The total dessert will lead to chaos in the transport
Germany overall in white: almost all the country had snow in the night.
In many streets, the chaos, the sticks and the aircraft are disrupted.
At least three people died in transport accidents.
Winter frozens Germany: Almost all the Republic fell on Thursday night at the winter temperatures of snow - which leads to transport chaos in many places.
On the north and east, it lies in some places up to 15 meters of snow.
A number of streets and a lot of roads are strongly about the movement.
At A7 in Flensburg, the road service was still in a plant, but it wasn't the new snow.
To that end, there was still a strong wind on the Baltic Sea.
The Society of Flood and Hydrography (BSH) expects to be at the Baltic Sea Coast of Shlesvik-Holština afternoon a swimming wind with the water condition of 1,2 metres above the normal.
The snow clusters have caused significant problems in Sasku on the streets and the state roads.
According to the Center of the bad weather Meteomedia, therefore, in Switzerland was the highest degree of plague on fibres - at all.
Of the part, there were 30 metres of the new snow, strong and fresh snow.
Some cost and personal vehicles remained there at night.
In Sasku-Anhalt, the police offices also reported great pressures on the streets.
A2 caused the wind and the snow to be slow and snow.
In Durynsk, there were snows on A4 and A9.
According to German roads, there is a large trend in Saska, Sasku-Anhalts, Duryn and North Bavorska.
Calls are the problems of snow on rows, turned trees on rows or broken top leading and avoidance.
In Saska, the remote operation from Lipska to Norimberk had to be stopped.
In the Dorian Saalfeld he had to stop one ICE in Mnich.
165 travelers got in the draft from the swimming and safe deck, food and drink.
Snow wind war over the road.
In the large German airports, the snows have been rejected for many years.
According to the speaking center for information about the years, Mnich's cancelled years have already been reported.
In Frankfurt to Mohan, the speaker Fraport has been canceled for 40 years.
The maintenance of roads is in constant saturation.
Although only a few travelers remained in the airport, 400 polar beds are prepared for them.
A lot of streets have occurred in the middle of the evening.
Last night, one cost car driver died at the train on the railway travel in Eastern Hollywood.
The driver was easily hurt.
Because of the snippet road, the Norimberk came near to a similar accident: the cost car was also captured here on the railway travel because the vehicle was whispered.
The leader died.
Four travelers were hurt in the tree - the way from Bayreuth to Norimberk, so it was closed until early hours.
And that's why a 30-year-old woman died after she returned to Aschaffenburg with her car.
However, the meteorological owner of the good news: the snow will remain in the form of easily breathing, and thus it will be reported in easily breaches.
But the wind is weak.
Only at the Baltic Sea will be the victories of the victory.
But it's going to be a big winter - locally to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for two-thirds
Deutsche Bank wants to disclose with his sign: According to one newsletter, the bank is looking for a buyer for two places with offices in the main seat in Frankfurt.
Incapacity could cost up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank just renewed its seat of the concert: the two-thirds of the France Bank have modernized; while the bankers have re-moving their old job.
But now, obviously, he wants the financial set of costs for renewation back - and he looks for buyers for both darknesses, as "Financial Times Germanland" reports with the call to the speaker.
The speaker wasn't designed by the planned sale.
"We continue to examine whether it is more meaningful incapacity to own or sell and then to recover," he said.
This is the biggest credit institution in Germany again, shortly after its fire seat.
The Bank took the two-thirds first in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of the own fund and then renewed them costly.
Energy conversion has been collected according to data about EUR 200 million.
The sales would probably bring a lot of money.
Experts from the workshop consider the value between renamed to Greentowers at a price of approximately 500 million euros.
The speaker said that it was not determined whether the building was sold again to the owner of the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of trucks for dead horns
More than 100,000 people have rejoiced in the memory of insulted horns in New Zealand, which were declared dead after several explosions in the bottom.
It has not yet been able to save the dead because security is still complicated in the shock.
Almost two weeks ago in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth to a strong explosion.
29 corners from 17 to 62 years have been thrown down.
In the shot where the accident occurred, the sondae was launched, not found any trace after life.
From high concentrations of eating gases and the following explosions, the salvation forces could not be reduced because of safety.
After the second strong detonators, the offices and experts have no chance of survival.
It hasn't yet been able to save the dead.
Now they've got the memory of the dead family and friends.
In Greymouth, on the southern island of New Zealand, ten thousands of people were saved in solar weather.
They've been silent for two minutes.
The memory of the insulted corners was placed on 29 tables, on which heals, lights, and names of corners.
The pictures and personal things, such as clothes and surfing pigs, also found their place here.
The state government buildings were putting flags on the half of the jail.
New Zealand hoped that the hornitors would return from the "deep country" to the surface, John Key said to the provinces of the provinces of the Ministry of New Zealand.
"But they never came home."
It can't be distracted with his son until he saw his dead man, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried down.
In addition to the Presidency and the family victims, the action was taken by a number of diplomates.
During the explosion of November 19, British and South African hornitors were also invaded.
Salvators started by making fire inside the coal valley on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the eating gas is released, it is combined with the deterioration of high temperatures inside, the police journalists said to the president Gary Knowles.
In the hell, warriors!
Is the horror coming to the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to get the old border again with his war epoch "Walhalla Rising".
What public would the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn mean when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
The hosted Viking fight with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be released from his torturers and in a great way kills almost with the overnatural force of their opposite - it sounds ideal for young ladies who seek blood action, because our herd helps with cruel killing methods and his enemies will even live inside when he has wrong injury.
On the other hand, as is called in the Property, the word will not be said during the whole movie, and the final terms will not exceed one or two of them or be allowed to strike towards a strastifully dead cries.
Otherwise, he silences and swims in a very beautiful land of Scotland, which offers a tour of Vikings the world about thousands of years ago.
The film is more ideal for adult films with interest in existency and very quiet cameras.
It's good if the movie has more target groups, it's only damage when they're dismissing each other.
Regisser Winding Refn, after he has struck his divorced and disabled triology on drug dealers "Pusher", is considered as a Danish version of Quentina Tarantina Regissor, but stoics are preventing to enhance his work with a more humor of the main flow or less brutal artistic public.
The majority of artistic cinematics are obviously allowed to be distributed to everywhere with brain and interiors.
The players of the action films will be removed at the latest at the time when the One is released from the freely explainable parts with a group of violent Christian missionaries ships in Jerusalem and remains a dream of whole equivalentity in unbelievable and milk than obviously putting a man into America and quiet there.
So there is no wonder that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" it wasn't in a cinema and now it was only issued on DVDs.
It is primarily damage because of beautiful claims, but also because it is a particular fasad, places to the collected blood, hiding an exciting movie, which has deserved a little attention.
This film doesn't refer to dialogue or exact , everything is an atmosphere, a hot dream that became a movie.
And it's not for a fucking man.
The ref doesn't allow him a minute of release and slowly breathes him with his fridge and cloud hypnotic sound track, especially the unwritable hatred that takes it from the heart of the position.
Only a little blonde boy who helps the One Ocean, keeps something like innocentness, all the rest are injured with evil.
Of all the most unified hero, whose motives will never be explained, which will become time for enemies and transitional warriors of the hell, perhaps by the devil.
It makes a destruction, but maybe only for the defects.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that is possible to hate and surprise, for disappointment, exciting and amazing.
The benefit.
Mystery of landwork
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Authority has a new warning on a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the earth prevents the exhibition, and it doesn't even allow controls.
About halfnoon from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli war airports F-15 I the mysterious quarter building in Syria.
They stand at the edge of Euphrata; the nearest city is 30 km away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Nuclear Energy Authority (IAEA) its name is revealed when it is a reacter that has dataly placed Syria using North Korea in this quarter hidden in the valley that turns away from the run.
On the basis of the reporting of the United States Secret Service, from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearby town of El Kibar, was well-speeded to the production of plutonians - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The technology of the fifty years is injured with nothing else.
She presented videos with unconcentred satellite photos.
The computer animation explained where the components of the reactive could be before the destruction should be decreased as a copy of the North Korea nuclear model of Yongbyon.
Furthermore, photos were presented that showed the building nearly or even inside.
The reacter was probably short before the start, but yet without fuel articles.
Today, after more than three years after bombing, it doesn't know much more than that time, even increasing deceit.
The former US president George W. Bush recently announced in his memories that she was very sure before an attack that Syria was building a reactor in el Kibar, but in fact she had no foundation that there was a "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some reporters of secret services in Europe are still more careful and are only talking about a "comprehensive reaction", although presentations are considered "trustful".
They miss evidence, like IAEA.
When the question is certain that he has a reacter before him, he answered the UN high diplomate in the summer, IAEA believes "a lack of material to ask questions".
The "non-used military buildings" is evidently rejected by Syrian, even though they were well equipped with the territory.
However, it was able to find the IAEA team in June 2008 under the leading of the former Main Inspector O ه ه Heinonen in el-Kibar of the uran trail, which was made by people.
Furthermore, IAEA received a satellite photograph of commercial sellers from nearly after an attack that should be greater than those she presented.
Unfortunately, these conclusions are not on the market because they have exclusively bought an unknown client - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA cannot therefore confirm their justice.
Syria said she had never had a secret nuclear program and even had a reactor.
Uran comes from the Israelites' weapons.
But it returned IAEA after the part analysis.
Since that time, Damasc has refused to discuss things - just as about satellite collections.
Furthermore, he prohibited the auditors of the second inspection in el Kibar and access to the concerns of a disbombed building.
But Israel will certainly be silent.
"We will never comment on it," confirmed the recent official statement at that time by the Governing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case is so directly drawn from June 2008 and "reached to a serious problem as regards the confidence of the Authority", as a high west diplomate in the IAEA seat in Vienna has admitted - it is, however, a serious violation of the nuclear weapons prohibited by IAEA.
IAEA considers a key to progress in matters other three equipment that are to be "in the ≥ connection" with a data reaction - and are still there.
However, the auditors did not have any effect on any equipment or any owner or why they were suspicious.
According to the news of Southdeutsche Zeitung, IAEA is internally marked as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, which has been brought back by nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite images of buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
The military base is obviously located inside or in the nearby - from this point, Syria refuses access to the IAEA to these three places.
In Wien, Syriane was afraid of fishing expedition - that IAEA would be sent before the United States to determine military bases.
Nuclear detectives were warned of the United States secret services.
IAEA has also foundations and satellite photos that the material was transported here and there between these three places and the fourth in Euphrata.
In Víden, a high west diplomat said at least one system should be "in relation to fuel production".
There are, however, "no evidence of sensitive activity", so the urane preservation and new processing; the processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reaction is driven by urination that is not rich.
Where, though, the uran comes from and where it should be recovered from poverty to a bomb, these central issues are only possible estimates.
It is also not known whether the concerns that could hide important tracks are hidden in these three places.
Jacobs disappeared from the surface of a hundred costs of costs of cars, no one seems to have information on where the road has reached.
Only a few kilometers away from el-Kibar and on the other hand Euphrat lying al-Tibni salt salt hall, which allowed Syria to check in 1998 as a suitable radioactive waste fund, IAEA considers unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley gave him a connection with an reactor in an analysis of satellite photos for the renamed newspaper Jane's Intelligence Review.
Photos from the universe, however, show that after IAEA requested access, Syria carried out in all suspicious landworks and removed large containers.
It could be the case, but it couldn't explain the suspicion.
Furthermore, the diplomatic circles are talking about the IAEA's commitment for many months to the creation of a review plan that would allow Syria to keep the case-like military secrets - only this shows how much the interest of the revisors is.
The lady also refused to do this.
If western diplomates in Vienna still have calmted a year ago that the reaction is destroyed, and therefore it doesn't burn, the USA's Officer Glyn Davies has spoken for several months of special inspections, which is one of the strongest architectures, which has the Visionian Nuclear Agency for Control.
Boss IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to inspecte, although he has already spoken of the "options to which he is in the future" while weighing.
This option is a high risk: On one hand, there is a need for the IAEA Council, and many of the 35 countries concerned are not absolutely interested in scaling.
On the other hand, one diplomat warns, "What happens if they finally don't find anything?"
Love in Wartime
Since Angelina Jolie began to work on still unnamed regimes in the summer, the moves arose.
She wrote a scenario, it's about the lovely story of a woman from Bosnia and the men from Serbia.
He doesn't know much more yet, but that's also causes unconfort.
They continued to talk about that the Muslim woman loved her during the war in Yugoslavia to the Serbian man who violated her.
Bosen's female associations protested immediately, so the planned trailing from Sarajevo to Hungary moved to Âro.
The film touched Hungary and was in the post-production, but in Bosnia still protested.
Bakira Hasecic from the Organization of Women's War victims wrote through the United Nations to help UNHCR Jolie and requested a meeting with herch, now the Bosnian newspapers - Jolie is also a high-scale UN Organization to help flights.
It's not just diplomatic - she offered women a week ago a meeting in Hungary, but they refused.
The meeting must be in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
In the camps where it was violated, loving stories were not lost, and Jolie’s position against the victim is expressing enough about the scenario.
Therefore, her organization recommended that the United Nations aid to flights be released by Jolie as a highlighting, informs Guardian.
What scripts did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has been reading its scenario, has allowed after small tachynies in Sara's tour -- not completely, why Jolie hasn't yet arrived.
The young author emphasizes that in her film, no political intentions have been followed by the conflict in Yugoslavia with a great effort to show the terrible consequences of war and to all parties involved in providing space.
Because of the range, it remains undetermined.
On the Internet, another version of the movie sounds really different: the lovers knew before the beginning of the war, and they meet again when it is as a Bosnian Muslim attached to the Serbian camp where he serves as a guardian.
The truth sounds pretty different than "the victim of violence is loved in his torture."
The fact that the Jolie film is actually starting before war is true.
Jolie suggests that there is a pressure on her, which "not right and is based on wrong information".
Now it can be released from Hollywood: By publicing it illegally on the Internet, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone
This evening it's good for Ira again.
Not a trace after the injury.
The home team dominates very clearly over his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Founders of joy for a sound of music, duped of feet.
Bailey-Pub in South Cork heat, because players are playing tennis bottles at three meters a distance to beer chemicals - and they embrace themselves.
"Pi" is called a bizarre division and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winner premium and to fly to Las Vegas to the world's mistership in the pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this crying pi's game and a sustainable information, it is not a lot together.
However, a 26-year-old man is trying to talk, to respond to the serious questions that will bring to the future.
His plan is not a playing game in Las Vegas, he goes to a conversation in January to New Zealand.
"I have such a wonderful feeling," he says.
"It's so far and I don't have a job there yet."
However, his girlfriend already waits in Auckland - "he immediately received her dreamed job as Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the wrong views of the house, they tried to make their happiness in the Tanner's two of the three birthdays.
His sister Yvonne, a social officer, is in Sydney, his brother Colin is now located as a IT adviser in London.
Boys leave: Like in Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
1000,000 Ireland will leave the country at the time of monitoring, foresee the experts of the Economy and Social Institute in Dublin.
They count up to 2015 with 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small land with only 4.5 million inhabitants, it is a fundamental loss.
If the statement is confirmed, it will take place a similar movement wall that Ireland suffered in the eighty years.
After the decades of the rebellion that has brought Ireland a great blessing, the disappointment is now re-extended.
The economic crisis is primarily increasing young, educated Ira, who have lived only a rebellion.
The loss of employment and social meeting has seemed absurd in these years of boom.
The need was everyone, the money was to buy.
Meanwhile, there are three of the ten women and men in 30 years without work.
In Irish Times, there are many letters of readers who tried to say, "In Ireland everything goes out of the cup."
"There should be the rise against politicians and bankers -- but who can, it goes away and our country loses the whole generation."
"Latter let him go."
Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future blackly because the government thinks only of claims and does not offer youths any views for the future.
"They reduce the minimum payment, but they have no strategy to create a new job," says 20-year-old.
She notes how her partners move from one unpaid practice to another.
Her greatest concern is that she'll have to move out in four years.
"This idea is mild and depressive."
Man like Stephen McLarnon is trying to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a total service on the theme of work in the starter.
"For starters on the work market, work in the workshop is a great chance, how to make the first steps on the career's ticket," says the manager.
On his web sites, there are photos of surfers in Australia and lingers on snowboard in Canada.
The message is: Working at the start is not gallery, but freedom and joy.
How it's to build somewhere else, he knows about half the year Sean O'Donovan.
Since 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues in building in Germany.
He's just putting a modern house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
The O'Donovan will rarely get home because he works in additional exchanges so he can pay a home loan on the house.
"The situation is sometimes really a little stupid," he says, when the first time after a long time, he's overcoming his own house's cup.
"I'm buying money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm not at all."
He laughs and runs cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good quarter with gardens maintained, parking large dear cars in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought a house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent financed by loan.
"It was a foolish time, simple money was without a lot of questions," he says.
He's afraid that it wouldn't be good with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks a little while, the hot tea down and says, "I have a kid I should live and I'm young; even if everything turns away, I can start again."
The building engineer has no crying that he hears so often.
"No one needs to hunger -- our ability is not even so dramatic as before on this island," he says.
"It's not the worst thing that can happen -- maybe we'll just feel like Ireland."
He laughs and then reports about his father who left for the last economic crisis to England.
"It was seven years ago, and life went on in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner has this idea.
Let the future be opened and just wait for life to be developed elsewhere.
He has also been working for a few years in London, and why should it not be good for New Zealand and his girlfriend too?
But there is another thing that makes him quite worried in these days: celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
They're afraid she could turn her back to divorce celebration.
"The mainly no emotion," he says, and he's drinking a little bird.
"Good, it sounds anxious."
"Let's call it the celebration of the department, totally simple, with some friends, a few drinks, a few hers."
Current practice of democracy
The support of democracy in Latin America grows as the support of private business.
Awareness is more fearful than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more influenced than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarometer investigation, which has been conducted in 18 countries and has been exclusively out of the magazine The Economyst.
Since the investigation has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can be followed by the changes in the positions of the whole area.
In the annual investigation of September and at beginning of October, two relating things are dominated.
It is that Latin America has a relatively joyful impact.
The second is to increase the stability of positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
The support of democracy in several countries in the South America area has grown significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth is average of 6% per year since 2002, the democracy support increased from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy was reduced after the deep reduction of production in the remote year.
But only about half of the questioned in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most popular ones, are the convictions of democracy, which downloads the regional prospect (see graph 2).
Approximately 44% of the respondents expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in their country in practice, the same number as in the latest year, but in comparison with the year 2001, when 25% worked, is a major growth (graph 3).
Approximately 34% indicated that they trusted the snow in their country and 45% trusted the government, again the same number as last year, but it was a large range compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis of the Democracy in Latin America was signed.
Support was probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries suffered only a short recess and enjoyed strong life.
Furthermore, the stronger social security network has helped the poor people to protect.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin Americans who lived in poverty only increased in 2009 and again increased to 32% in this year.)
We're still changing in a wide spectrum from the land to the land (see Graph 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its representative President Luize Inácia Luly da Silvy reflects in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recess was more serious and has deteriorated the state of violent criminal activity.
As soon as research has been started, more respondents than Latin America have seen as the most important problem of crime than unemployment (see graph 5).
Approximately 31% says that they or their nearby family have become victims of criminal action in the remote year, but it is a decrease compared to 38% of the past year and is also a lowest number since 1995.
The massive economic efficiency is reflected in growing support for private enterprises and market economy: approximately 71% of the respondents, in addition to the whole, say that private enterprises are necessary for development, this percentage increased from 56% of 2007 (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58% agree that market economy is the only system that allows developing their country, this percentage has increased from 47% of the past year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have the same view (and 80% are supporting private enterprises), although their left president Hugo Chavez has a lot of private fires.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in, as mentioned in 19% of respondents (approximately 18% in the remote year), followed by the United States (9%, over the low year without change) and Venezuela (9%, over 11% in the remote year)
However, the United States are considered the most influential countries in Mexico and in large part of Central America, whereas Venezuela enjoys success in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Nikaragu.
Critical options
No one expected the general choices of Haiti on 28 November.
But they were far worse than outsides who try to help the land getted to fear.
The elections represented the filling of urnes and repeated votes, the voting lists spread by channels, broken election rooms and fear.
Optional rooms opened after hours of late.
Many haitikans, including many moved from January landing, moved around and tried to see where they could go to choosing.
Some of them finally gave it.
More than ten presidents, including some of the assumed preliminars claimed that it was the subject of submission and calls after the removing of elections.
Protests, some of them of a violent nature, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, a highly established United Nations officer in Haiti, declared that "in many ways it was a very good choice."
The observers of the United States and the Caribbean community said carefully that "they do not believe that such inequalities, whether they were serious, did not have to cancel the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The election authority, whose opposition votes are committed to René Preval, shall notify the non-argumental President and his candidate to Jude Célestin the preliminary outcome on 7.
The expected decision-made is planned for ice.
All elections are not lost.
Two former opposition candidates, Michael Martelly, raper and Mirlande Manigat, former lady, departed from their p's calls to the vote to be declared invalid.
But it may be a problem if Mr Célestin, who has a small or delicate support between electors, will be designated to the electoral committee because he has reached a decision-making fight.
Because of a regular cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people who still live in the states after landing, feared that the election would be low.
Finally, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they were defensed from the deorganisation.
Approximately 250 000 demonstrations of identity that are necessary for voting have remained shortly before elections.
It's a lot in the ship.
The donors see the election of legitimate and arbitrary governments as a primary step in the Haiti reconstruction.
And then it's nice that the Haitians are going to do it alone.
In the middle of the puzzle
In the weeks when she suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, the argentin president, was heavy with the sympathy of the public when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since it was chosen in 2007.
Nevertheless, turning this success into a successful campaign for the second period of elections in the next year can depend on whether Ms. Fernández's trailer delivers the incompatibleness of her deceased husband, preacher and political partner Nestor Kirchner.
And all of these knowledge will be worth it.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued in economic policy, even after his wife succeeded to become a president, was increasing in the establishment of budgets under the tax income, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to lose further income for freedom.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost in the remote year in Congress.
But the opposition was divided and further destabilised by Mr. Kirchner's death on the infarct on October 27.
Some members of the governing political movement of Peronist have joined Mrs. Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (which affected the fax and accusation of the government from corruption), the Congress could not approve the budget for 2011.
"I don't agree to come," said the president.
It will also be paid for 2010 for the next year, while the President will have more space to lose for freedom.
Economy is overheating: this year is likely to grow up to 9%.
The official level of inflation is now up to 11.1%, but many private estimates and professionals are talking about numbers that are close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who entered the Office in 2003, when Argentina was sucking the economic colaps, set a priority for growth and decreasing poverty, rather than for inflation control.
He refused to operate with MMF, pressed the private sector and cleaned INDEC, the statistical agency, which had been accompanied to monitor the official inflation.
Can President Fernández now kill this policy?
She invited to negotiate between private undertakings and committees.
And her officers say they want to limit the growth of the feeds to 18% in the next year.
The economy was supported by the growth of world prices for the export of argentin agricultural products.
But the inflation caused the growth based on a big devalvation in 2002.
This may be the reason why Mrs. Fernández gives acknowledge that he wants to restore the argentin financial liaisons to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the Government has established an agreement with the debt holder who have previously refused to restructure the debt which Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Now Mrs. Fernández's agreement with the credentials of the governments in Paris's club, which deserves approximately $6.7 billion.
Kirchners' worked on not to have this MMF monitoring as used.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economics, announced that the Fund would provide a "technical assistance" to provide a new national user-value index, which will lead to the purification of INDEC.
There is no longer any idea whether Mrs. Fernández will want to stay in politics after the end of the period when the husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, he will obtain support for the central class, which is deceived by chirurgism.
At the time of the return of the Argentinas from the summer allowance, which has in March, the wall will fall into sympathy.
He will want to win further choices, he will have to decide whether there is a need for silence for many opinions that her husband has stopped in politics.
Semi-encouraging for China
The Taiwan electors are closer to the closer connection with peʹna.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother through the sea?
More than 7.5 billion elections, 70% of the authorised, chose on 27 November the city's age and advice in five cities, which may be considered as a larger evaluation of President Ma Ying Yeu.
Mr. President Has alone is a representative of feelings that have a strong set of business issues, including partially free trade agreements, in the largest comparison of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma has passed a test, but it's just very hard.
Although its side of Kuomintang (KMT) ended with three of the five of the ancestors, she could not win the vote.
According to the democratic progress of the Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is the most independent of Taiwan, obtained at least 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it was the president's election, President Ma should be able.
Since two years ago, the share of the votes of his side was decreased by approximately 8%.
First, the DPP party was together with the MTT in the town Councils.
The elections were played as a number of Taiwan elections that include sound choice cars and mass coverages with flags with covered girls.
In part, it was even a secret attempt to attend.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chana, the honest President of KMT, was aggressing for KMT candidates in the previous election evening.
The man from Dava shot the young Mr. Lien cleanly through his face, hurt him and killed a whistle.
It was not strangely determined whether the weapons were intended to hurt Mr. Liena or to cope with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, leader DPP, claims that the shooting has affected elections, suspicion falls on DPP and leads the elector to KMT.
I hope the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was watchful how she remained in the background of the question of the single peʹna.
Instead, the candidates have deployed plans for the public housing building and creation of jobs.
Taiwan usually enjoys his de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
Hence, the MTT has the trend to avoid the commitments to the Government in Peking.
But this time, DPP also left from the exhaustion of anti-Chinese positions.
It is a reaction to the relief and realization that Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. Ma, on his behalf, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable for Taiwan.
From the Government in Peking, it can be expected to continue in commercial payments, together with its strategy to take Taiwan back to the flood.
China did not spending time when sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize summits on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would also see political integration, but in order.
This will be better expected after the president's elections in 2012.
The DPP party in any case discovered herself.
Two years ago, it was wrong at the level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to the conclusion on the basis of a corruption accusation.
The president in 2000-08 was a bullshit and a station of independence.
But under the leading of Mrs. Tsai, a new generation developed, which is deadly, and DPP works firmly to join professionals and young people.
Mrs. Tsai was called as a DPP candidate at the president, such as Su Tseng-changem, who was the office under Mr. Chen.
Their sides are now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Peking.
Mrs. Tsai has published the research institutions' plans which serve as a contact place between DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can be conducted without the previous submission.
Mrs. Tsai reports to the Taiwan public that her side is a "trusted alternative" to the invasive access of Mr. Ma to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be disappointed by this movement.
In the statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would be better if they were to be Taiwan's own country.
He even commanded Mr. Su, the pleasure to be a president.
But even without the need of Mr. Chena, DPP will fight for the choice between potential candidates.
KMT is authorised to search for own people.
Mr. Ma's appreciation was bad, even though the excessive time of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign.
His disapproval seems to be based in particular on unemployment and to lose the loss between the rich and the poor.
The KMT speaker says he reorganizes his cabinet, as well as local switches.
The strongly advanced efforts for Taiwan's support for the association of friends are deteriorated.
At the same time, the number of Taiwan citizens considers an inevitable economic integration with China.
According to Antonia Chianga, a prominent publicist, "the way from which no return has come."
Grammy Price name: Esperanza Spalding song is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
The request of the president and the people must notice legally.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year jazz basic and singer, which President Obama chose to exhibit Nobel's price ceremonie for peace in 2009, is marked as one of the surprises of Grammy's prices in this year with nomination in the best new artist category.
Since Spalding was celebrated by the jazz scene since 2008, when its "Esperanza" album came out, the nomination came a little late, but it is in accordance with Grammy's rules when the artist cannot issue more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist has been set."
Its ambitional album of 2010 "Chamber Music Society" certainly mentioned a step forward and thanks to its unalmost vocal and dead hand with the elements of pop, function and latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success that in 2003 mentioned Norah Jones, the nearest equivalent for voters in Grammy, who are looking for similar jazz work in this category for the last years.
Other portions Grammy rightly appreciate the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historycy" in an instrumental album category, exciting, refreshing album box, which was a warm favorite in the remote year.
Iyer will competite against the album of the experimented saxofonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and John Beasley's keys "Positootly".
Thrombone Shorty, a famous favorite from New Orleans and a fair host in the HBO "Treme" order was assessed in the current jazz category, which is differently attached to Stanley Clark's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with the knowledge of steampunk has received a number of deserved recognition in a category of large files when the commoor jazz Childs En and still courageous Dave Holland, whose live album with the "Pathways" octe has created a beautiful example of how the base can have a free hand as a captain.

Planned mixture in Temecule is approved by the Planning Committee
The planned mixture in Temecule has obtained a single support for the local planning committee in more than five hours of frequency of public witnessing.
Critici attacked the project that promotes terrorism and will lead to the delay of trade.
However, the opposers decided about the middle night that the new religious centre is in accordance with local laws and will be effective.
"Several good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews you remember," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, said on Thursday.
"I'm very proud of it as a American citizen."
"It means that justice wins."
"Oposition is minimum" added.
"They who are opposers only speak voices."
"We have good people in our valley."
It started at six hours of evening and continued to the north of the time when the debate was taken with people who were for or against the center. These voices were divided equivalently, the Press-Enterprise.
Discussion continued on the web pages of newspapers.
"There is no longer America," appeared one comment.
"We're the Planet of Opia with Socho freedom fell into the sand."
"America has fallen."
The Planned Islamic Centre also called protests in other parts of the country, including the neighborhood of Ground Zero, the tragedy place that was held on 11 September 2001 when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley I have Mahmoud Harmoush a violent trial.
His religious province reading approximately 135 families lived in Riverside County after a year without an incident, but he wanted to be more and more appropriate than the funding space that he was borrowing together with the manufacturer of filtering systems.
The new mixture of 24 943 quarter stages in the Mediterranean will also have two minerals and grow up to 43 degrees.
She should take a place of 4,32 acres at Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometers eastward from Chaparral High School.
The opposers can still call to the town Council on the project.
Microblocks with distortion against arc increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
Finding a wonderful bacteria that can use arsen as one of its foods expands the space to search for new forms of life on Earth and maybe further.
The scientists discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claimed that it was a sign that life has the opportunities that stand outside the main elements that have been considered and found.
"This body has two powers."
"We can grow either by phosphor or arsen."
"That's very special, but it's not a evidence that it's a quality form of 'netherlands' life," he emphasized this fact Paul C. W. Davies from Ar ́na State, together with the reports that appeared on Thursday in the online publication of the Science magazine.
Longuho was considered necessary for life six main elements - carbon, hydrocarbon, sugar, acid, fosfor and sulphur.
However, scientists discovered that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake in California are able to continue growing after the replacement of the fosfor.
"Beginning to surprise what everything is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arına State, together reports.
This finding is important to look for life outside the Earth because researchers must be able to divorce life and think how life can seem, said Anbar.
He's focused on microbs found on Earth.
However, the report of this newspaper has been published to discuss it, which has not expressed the detail of finding, has called out a wide speculation on the Internet that the report is discovering the discovery of alien life.
It's not so.
Revelation "shows that other planetary organisms can be able to use other elements that lead to biochemia and that the elements we consider 'standard' must not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor on Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open, in Milton Keynes, Britain.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the substitution of one element by the elements of the basis biochemic and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a suitable finding.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, who conducted the study, went to Mono Lake because she shows a high coal of arzene.
Arzen and fosfor are chemicals very similar elements, so she thought that the microb, which is exposed to both elements, could be able to replace one another.
"Arzen's primarily driving because his chemical behaviour is very similar to phosphor."
"The result is that organisms can be very difficult to separate these elements from themselves."
"Now, the arzen is so different that it does not work as the fosfor. When it gets into the body, it begins to work in biochemical processes," explained Anbar.
Scientists shade the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exhibit the growing concentration of arse which are able to adjust and grow.
Microbs grow better in the action of fosfor, but because they can also survive with the replacement of arsen, it increases the possibility that the form of life that uses arzen can be discovered naturally, or anywhere else on the Earth or on another planet or month, where the arc is more running.
Jamie S. Foster, a professional microbiology assistant to Florida, announced that the idea of arzen that could be replaced by phosphor is not a new, but has never been found an example to be shown.
Arzen was more running in the past times on Earth, said, and so the people speculated that they could use it for the former form of life.
"This indicates that there could be other ways to create life, not only by the way he was created in the early period of the Earth," said Foster, which was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Institute
The rest of stealing dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower motel were found. He informed the sheriff of Los Angeles on Thursday.
Four exhibitional dogs - two assets and big pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, where they spent night at Bellflorer Motel 6, reported the offices.
Two dogs were discovered in the middle of the afternoon and there were two dogs in the middle of the evening, said Steve Whitmore, the speaker of the police office for Los Angeles.
"The good news is that dogs are all right," said Whitmore.
"They're in a good state."
"They were delivered to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where dogs were found, in which location, did not share the details about their finding.
"The research continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We keep the rules."
The dogs, Christina Rickard and David Peek, were not imprisoned to get out to the case.
They were greatly happy when their two actions were found in the middle of the afternoon in the prison in Downey.
Sheriff's representatives found out and two dogs separately in Compton.
Action Trace, 3-year-old dog Trace and 10-month phen, Didi, were without hurt, reported offices.
But Bunny and Peter, the people of Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were planning to take up competitions this week by the name of their Japanese owners, remained not found until they were late in the middle.
Peek and Rickard who live in Redding are this weekend in the city to attend AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they were to show Trace in the plan.
Other dogs had to competite in other competitions planned in days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, said Peek the Times journal in the middle.
South California is only once a delay for the monthly traveling couples by dogs of exhibitions.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard were registered in the motel.
Often they cross in motels and park their car before the room window.
They also took three dogs - boxer boxers, Parson's terrier and British boxes - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Actions and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where they should be cold.
They've got a little window to have a few dogs in the car enough fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported a car clothing at 6 hours on Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a recompense to anyone who is leading to the lost dogs, and the dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, the prices would be granted.
Lev is ready to go back now when restructuring MGM is obtained from the court of final approval
After 18 months of disturbance and inconvenience, MGM finally got green so that she could start again.
The Federal In-Jork Court of New York on Thursday officially blessed the "before the packaging" plan of believers to compensate about $5 billion and to clean the road for 86 years age company, which aims to produce and produce films and television shows.
The fourth result that the plan complies with the US competitive rule requirements does not have any legal obstacles to restart the Spayglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum founders who become the main leaders of the educational study.
The beginning of employees is about 320 of more than 400.
The MGM shall not depart immediately from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase is not agreed on the planned financial resources allowing $500 million to finance new operations and MGM production.
It is now a connection with the investment bank, which is expected to be $75 million and to finance around half of the bank.
The restructuring process started in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. investment bank was entrusted to advise the management of how to solve its funds, since the management was fighting to allow rate payments for $300 million per year.
In August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, the former Director-General of Enron and Professor for Awards, known for Crispy Kreme Doughnutts.
The study was longer than expected to solve the MGM financial movements and 140 believers.
After a few months, the parties agreed that they would be sold by the company until the end of 2009.
Although a few interesters were attractive, no one of them was willing to pay $2 billion plus the finance requested by the creditors.
At the year of the year, everything was back on the rice and the MGM team began to work on the plan of restructuring. After months of discussion and internal accidents, the plan was finally approved by the believer at the end of October.
When MGM in the following weeks is officially raised from the concurrence, Moelise and Cooper will receive multi-million bonuses in dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will be paid to $9.5 million.
Cooper firms who incase for their services running during the company, 375 000 dollars a monthly, will receive a recompense for success, e.g. 4 million dollars.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to renew production in MGM, which has issued only one movie in this year, and to give up on seven or eight movies that will come out at the beginning of 2012.
They are also planning to participate in the finance of two films whose proposals will be the Hobit book, and that together with Warner Bros.
It has a special loan between 265 million and 275 million dollars to finance its share in these two films that Peter Jackson will register.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owned approximately 18% of MGM debts, looked for the possibility of associating the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between both companies have not been established in the Agreement.
Technological games that will maintain your budget for gifts in balance
The leading candidate of the year is the most sensitive iPad game that follows the videoheral system. In both cases, however, it is an extraordinary principle for the budget of gifts.
Think that at the price of one iPadu you can buy five angles BMX for 99 dollars and one Kinect game is the same as 10 coral shoes or approximately 48 games Play-Doh.
But there is a way to maintain your budget for gifts in the balance.
Recently I visited three national players - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and followed what electronic games I could buy for less than 80 dollars.
It was instantly that Moore's law worked; annual players have much more energy, and it is at the same prices, if not lower, in comparison with the past years.
While relatively less new games with associated web games, two most famous games of this type, Webkinz and Penguin Club, offer more.
Increases the number of games with button battery, as the game with battery providers.
Here's some recommendations.
(All those prices are from Toys "R" Us, other than cases that are marked differently.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, from 3 years) are a flash animal that dwells when you press them.
On one pressure, the animal is released tone and the second press begins to create a song.
You're buying more than one, they'll sing together and harmonic.
Warning: When you get a cat, you can't stop.
The best choice in the combination of song and dance is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, since 2 years)
Last year, I spent on Elmo Live technology a 14-pained animation boy that can play the game Simon Says and also know monthly walks thanks to his innovation nice legs with blocking rounds.
Children test Mickey dance instructor game, although their parents are moving to the lack of volume control.
You're a 80-year-old child, maybe you remember Al Papa, one of the first computer educational games.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, 40 dollars, for children of 3 years), with a bathroom of full cheese cards that are designed so that the car changes into fun with a self-reparable, funny workshop.
You send a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the most important variance with simple use, with kwerts of keyboard, although games do not have such effects as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change in the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with elderly units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce her and e-books and has a SD card slot that allows family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children of 8 years) is a five-coats file which are not less than a box of fire, each of them has a LED screen.
The purpose is to create words by putting the coat into a row before it expires the time; it's great for competition in improvized form of words.
Still more games has at least a kind of online connection.
In the highest place, two webkinz and Penguin clubs were represented in play rooms.
You want to buy your child a online game from the Penguin Club, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, 5$, for children from 6 to 12 years), which contains mines with a characterized code.
When you activate the online code, your child will receive enough credits in the Penguin Club stores for two liberal items.
That might include a round-breed or a Puffle-animal.
About something smaller than the success of your teeth card is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children of 5 years), the latest of the microworks on the button battery.
Brook is moved to 12 vibrating silicon feet in adequate direction.
It's fun if you're doing a blast of the coat and watching if he can find the way out.
He's also very disappointed.
It was able to fall down from the kitchen table and even spending a time in our dog's ground.
Income of the more fair police control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked after the camp, he closely controled his orders and issued orders with the military authority.
He wanted female members - Chinese state winners of the city order, feared and repeated for their strong steps and pleasure in violence - to have a certain incidence on the covering.
"Stay right!"
"Speak!"
Show them, swimming silence, how beautiful girls look!
Four very young girls in white hands and the same olive cabs and bullets were watched.
Four pieces of black bottles are fitted as a line.
Four coverages of the head are perfectly sitting on hairs that are perfectly connected with blue and white stones.
"I personally think they look prominently," said Mr. Tang overseerly.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government tried to rescue the image of cities overseers in China.
One city ordered new students to have high school education.
Guangdong's province changed green-green uniforms in a more attractive blue.
Wuhan in the Middle China replaced strong weapon views: in 2009, a report indicated that 50 operators were surrounded inappropriately by a carrier with bottles and were able to look at the owner until the householder was packed and departed after half hour.
Xindu, a city period with 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu chose the operations for the main image.
Since 2003, he supplemented his city police with 13 women, which had been elected in accordance with their view, proportionality and youngness.
The goal is to show outside the gross side of the police also a more yellow, female side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson should have a challenge to get into the secret Chinese city groups.
They would argue critics from a good deal.
For the end of the police, these police are only allowed to promote the city statement, rebuke and other administration of the posts.
But Chinese communications run running to take a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the province of Hubei struck an unemployed wheel to die after he used his mobile to turn up, as they started in the process of protest against the square.
In the remote year, the schooling of police in Peking was stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual, there was no other description of how to break the pachater without a sign of blood.
This year, a householder with a melone in Shanghai has reached five cops and has suffered the damage of the left part of the brain.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded on the Internet shows Chinese police how they attack the street seller.
"Chengguan feared the government," China Daily, a national issue, cried out in the latest year after further discussion on taktics.
The paper was "really cleared".
The skeptics say that such access will be lost.
After the period in October, the leader of the Beijing Evening News asked whether women had a obligation or are only a dilution.
The answer seems to be from both.
The period requested women's attendees from 18 to 22 years with a good position and "five characters of faces in the right proportion."
Adeptics should have a height higher than the average - so higher than 1.6 meters.
The service in 26 is obligation.
Functionaries claim that work is too psychical for women over 25 years.
"Their image is an important thing," said one of the most designed police officers at Rednet.com, like government websites.
"Candidates must first show external quality, which then specify further, belong to the height, weight, faces, etc."
Then it comes to a series of honors and "internal quality".
Women are like flowers, he said and added, "Besides being bounds, they will also have other responsibility."
Zheng Lihua, director of the periodic city, does not agree with this description.
But he highlighted that high-level requests are also running in China for other jobs, both of them.
Like a demand for the corresponding face drawing.
What means that the question of good consideration is between China's subject to discussion.
Medicinal suspension or congelation shall certainly not be valid.
"You can't allow us to serve a chrome or crazy man," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps a guard in Baoguang near the cave, is 22 years old, faces as a jabble and a fucking sharked mouth.
She doesn't think she could have a sexist at her view, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with ironic view.
Her 21-year Xu Yang says, "Our task is to represent the image of the city."
They have no murder against their ambition, they said, because their career ambitions are more than just starting trademakers in the streets where they can do their activity.
Each group stands against more than ten marketers who run the sands or on the wheels and try to sell as much as the top and the mixture of tofu before they are scattered.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
"We have told you many times!" said Mr. Xu when he began to flee, and for a time left his road with a car with noise.
Policists describe their obligation as more monotonous than the dealer.
"Every day it's the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who's studying in his free marketing.
"Great Rutine."
One of them is that women's cops have no power as their men's prosecutors to be able to enjoy goods.
They can only be threatened that giving a message to their man's leader.
The tend to protect them then from the emergency public proofs of enemy against the official apparatus running throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the main town of Yunnan, were rebelled after false news that the police killed the sellers.
More than ten police officers or police officers were hurt at night hours; 14 government vehicles were reversed or revoked.
Xind's been removing such a violence.
But the calm can only be assured in the mood.
Only two blocks from Baoguang's quiet location, where the police guard had, were stored over 50 people on the round of the street.
Policies entered the motorcycle that was on the traveler instead of the sale within, as the rules require.
The owner of the car could weep as he wanted.
15 minutes away from the police officer, faced up, with locks against vehicles and goes away with the motocycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the man group, remained behind, his white mark turned around to leave his name.
Like female cops, the coordinators are men over 40 years who have only a help role.
They are not trained in the maintenance and embrace of images.
"We sometimes fight verbally."
"We sometimes fight physically," said Mr. Li things.
"The majority of this is a public who is concerned with it."
Prosecutors can accuse Senator Ensign
The Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign from the criminal accusation related to his case with the former campaign adviser and his efforts to make the lobbys in the middle of the Senator.
The most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, the Nevada Republican, had concluded with the decision, which had been considered as a potential Republican candidate for 2012 as a president for 2012. His affair was reached to national titles and harmed his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said that he was a decision that followed at the same time after the annual investigation, "really rejoiced".
The Senator could still lead to disciplinary management at the Ethical Committee of the Senate.
Mr. Ensign's workers said that the Ministry of Justice "informed us that Senator Ensign was already going to investigate and that it wasn't in plan to make another accusation against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to dismiss the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers other than the Ministry of Justice, who claimed that there were serious evidence that Mr Ensign had prepared a violation of the prohibition of federal lobby.
The conversations, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 in New York Times indicated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to ensure the lucracy of lobbys that would lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthie, about the senator relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton worked as a traveler in the Ensign campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr Hampton and supported their opinions after Mr Hampton was employed to work for them, so much he refers to documents and discussions.
Since Hampton was recently delivered by Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was removed from the law of his former employee's lobby or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts claim that Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hamptton, who were friends before, were in contrast with the prohibition of lobbying.
From the evidence that were published "is found that it is the case of law violation," Stanley Brand, a washington lawyer specialised for the deal of customers who are investigated by the government.
While the officers of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the decision in the case of Senator Ensign, Mr. Brand and other lawyers, specialising on the ethics, said that the Ministry is careful about political claims, after a large number of injuries, including the decision of the previous year to stop the complaint against the former Senator Ted Stevens with the accusation of the suspicion of the State representative.
The Federal Prosecutors "hissed the weapons clearly," said Melanie Sloan, the Executive Director of the Civil Organization for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Response and Ethics in Washington), a lawyer group, who has given a number of disputes against Mr. Ensign.
"It shows basically that the highly established government officers do not respect the laws," he added.
Paul Coggins, Master Lawyer of Mr. Ensign, in the discussion, reported that the State Representative of the Ministry of Justice called him on Monday and then the second day, and told him that the Ministry did not seek any accusation against his client.
Mr. Ensign's committee cooperates with the complainant in trying to convince it that the Senator, as his office repeated in the central declaration, "he acted in accordance with the law".
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he gave to the State representatives.
"I am not pleased to count the details of my debates with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they have made the right decisions," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Committee decided to stop investigating the private complaint, in which the ethical group charges that the payment of Ensign Hampton parents has violated the federal election law.
The election committee noticed that she had not enough evidence to demonstrate that money did not mean anything other than a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find a lobby work was NV Energy, the main non-governmental company which supported the Senator.
One e-mail from 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began to act as a lobbyist, leader of Mr. Ensigna - John Lopez, he communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "bushing" to the Ministry inside on the subject discussed.
Mr. Ensign also took a breakfast with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transport to make a meeting with the name of the aircraft company after what Mr. Hampton would find on the lobby work.
When the first year was revealed, Mr Ensign apologized his electors and rejected his own, as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After the multi-month stagnation, Mr Ensign informed reporters two weeks ago that it was planning to reach the third election period in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer aimed at investigating the criminal action of his speaker Jennifer Cooper, the senator hopes that the Ethical Commission will follow the Ministry of Justice and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is pleased to continue in his private work in the name of the Nevada people," she continued.
Cheshire foreign connection turns to Twitter
In the rows of the court court, half of them wrote.
A minute after a minute, they sent news about a terrible witness through Twitter.
Finally, the campaign says that more than 140 000 news on Twitter were made by violence and joining children to bed in a house that was left.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayese, who was sentenced to kill three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, families, and had to have an official end with the storage of the death penalty for which the portion voted.
But Mr. Hayese's lawyers have already made a revocation with requests and arguments that the court would probably work for years.
One of the most prospectual is that the intensity of reporting about the process - includedly extended use of Twitter's main reporters - created "circus atmosphere" and this extensive, unexpansive information with disturbing details, then reported to the decision in the sense of the public's influence.
This claim may cause the judge to question whether to also require new rules in the case of a new court.
"As I lived in this surface, I think there is a real danger that the attachment of new initiatives in the court affects the rights of the justice process for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayese's main deputy.
The Court of Justice of Jon C. Blue of the State's Supreme Court rejected strictly the statement on the expenditure of the last week, with the fact that the communications were "inspectively controlled" and that no evidence would indicate that the court acted under the public.
But it's probably not about the last word in this case.
In the past decades, the court recognised that the reporting of nottoricly known cases could cause questions on the justice of the process.
In the Court Regulation of 1966, the United States High Court revoked the sentence of the Cleveland chiropract, Dr. Sama Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when in his decision he said that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the process of communication was "carneval atmosphere".
Some are convinced that this criminal action was inspiring TV show and the "Uphlik".
Some lawyers said that the revocation courts that reviewed Hayes' sentence of half a century could be surprised by the argument that the new rules that determine the way of communication from the court courts, which was unrepresentable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general deal to concern the impact of new media," in highly followed cases, John J. Donohue III, professor of law Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was done freely.
Professor Donohue pointed out that some judges may be aware of the idea that without restriction of communication from the court courts, the process can be more justified.
The case of Twitter is only one of the many accused lawyers of Mr. Hayese who would be able to argument years to maintain the execution of the judgment.
For example, the complainants claim that in the case of Mr. Hayese, it may be a prejudice when the judge of Blue refused to test the reactions of potential portors by showing them a criminal photo of urgency in the choice of a portion.
Some of the opposers said that they were scared by the photographs of the victims that Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The complainants claim that the constitution of death is also rejected and claims that the judge has wrongly revoked the sentence that was critical against the state representatives and that he has wrongly put his decision on the verdict and directed the report to think about the weekend.
Parents weren't separated.
But their arguments on the impact of the process range can affect the greatest interest.
In a meeting against the verdict last month, the case was dominated by the reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign of the candidate to the Senate of the United States.
They argued that communications continued to breathe emotional flames in this case.
"The day of the media, cameras and reporters before the court," wrote the lawyer, " there was something that was not yet here in New Haven, and it may also be about a national distraction."
Their adjustment to Twitter's action is controversial.
In the discussions, some journalists claimed that without reporting, it was more embarrassing than the reports mentioned after and that the police should, in their view, conduct the field of other processes.
However, some lawyers requested revocation courts with often used arguments that social and social changes require adjustment of courts.
Mr. Hayese's workers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in the case of Dr. Sheppard's judgment, due to the wide effect of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell in the 21st century."
Can the lowliness overcome the ruin?
After a campaign that was careful of her vulnerability and negativism, this week was a small quantity of distress in Washington.
Is this the first entity of the real cooperation of two political parties or only an illusion of a moment before returning to a side fight in the main city?
The internal negotiation of President Obama and the leaders of the parliamentary leaders has not introduced any principles on the principles to be negotiated during the meeting.
In any case, however, there was a close debate on two parties' opinion differences, as well as the definition of their common responsibility, rather than the other empty episode of the page-making.
The Central Public Meeting of the President's Deficit Committee was also civilised, even through the political differences between the members.
It seems that the nearby competition has developed a mutual respect for a few months that exceeds the ideological ruin that the members still share.
And it's quite uncomfortable to claim that it has started a new era of cooperation.
Both parties are now in the experimental period - they investigate each other the mark of collegeality and compromise, trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and election patientness against the renewed side war.
Therefore, Wednesday's negotiations and its further evaluations were also carried out with minimum applications or accusations.
The philosophy differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to take place a change in proportions here for the last two years.
About the question of tax, expenditure, health care or rights, both sides are far away.
Nevertheless, the November elections were prepared for at least Washington.
"There is no question whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at Ethics and Public Policy Centre.
"They're inevitable by choices.
The choices made the emotions of the pages, and then they silenced.
It's good."
In some questions, particularly those who have to be discussed at the meetings, the Republican and the Democratic Little Chance to find a solution.
Bush's decreasing tax has expired at the end of the year, and no one considers it positive.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or everyone, and it's permanent or temporarily.
Similarly, as a probably compromise on unemployment doses only because the Republicans cannot see how they support the reduction of taxes for the property, while refusing unemployment support.
After Tuesday negotiations in the White House, it is already possible to see more optimism about the possible agreements in these issues, together with new starting with them.
But William Galston from the Brookings Institute warns that a successful cooperation on fundamental issues needs to lead to the relationship of two political parties when the 112th Congress is called on ice.
It's probably an accidental period, or it's even inevitable, he said.
"When things are done to be done, psychology will be in short perspective returned to one of the conflicts," he said.
Wohner also expressed skepticism - which is in a significant way extended - to bring to the integrity along with their cooperation.
"I am looking at all events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box when the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
D’s largely related to the construction of a new Republican house in the White House and the tea party electors who helped it to create it.
The Republican leaders now stand before the risk of increase, think that they must act in accordance with their promises and have to reduce the expenditure of the government and cancel the new health care law.
These proposal lines are held in initial reactions to recommendations on deficit, including reform of tax law and increase in certain taxes, increase in revenue and reduction of expenditure.
Society President Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles took one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and May, according to their opinion, to develop the pressure of deficit to a public programme of ways that cannot be ignored.
But 14 votes needed in the 18th Committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and thus fight to draw closer to this number as possible.
The biggest opposition is among the elected officers in the report, who claim that in the case of financial issues we have, at least today, small foundations or reasons for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in fighting between the White House and the Parliamentary Republics.
The next year will be in the form of side conflicts when the republians will call Obama to solve the budget, tax and health care for the periods of more lateral cooperation.
What will cause the move?
Public opinions.
There are many evidence that, despite the page of the last choices, the Americans still want to see two parties working together.
In 1995, both sides will be very carefully monitored by public reactions.
Anyone who will threaten the reduction of votes will probably change the course and seek compromise.
It may be optimistic view of things.
Parties and amendments are today more than in half the ninety-years and shows that a more ideological disaster has been created between Obama and the Parliamentary Republic than in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
In addition to activists on both sides, 2010 is a preliminary for more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the deepness that has been revealed this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will be a lot of effort on both sides to find common bases in issues that are still dividing them.
Exposed American document counts Moscow as an attack of corruption
The management of the city is in the hand of "cliptocracy" and it continues parts of taxes and taxes for protection that come to Kremlin, giving the American ambassador in Russia in magazines from February.
Police and the Federal Security of the service are largely maintaining protective wings that help explain high costs for life in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal trade but also from organised criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "vertical of the office" - will take his own when money turns up to the top.
The record sent to Washington under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle was published in the middle of WikiLeaks on their websites.
The record is based on resources that have been edited.
The record was written at the time when Yuri Luzhkov was still older and accused him of a large part of corruption.
He was revoked by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but since that time, we can only follow the minimum changes in cleanness.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who was owned by the prominent company, continued to complain about the corruption after many years, and wined a number of claims for cruel accusation for such orders.
In September he said to the Russian television station, when he was asked for a demonstrated testimony of corruption, "It's crazy, it's a spine, it's a swimming."
The Russians with absolute conviction that if their company is corrupt, it will be shown to vote.
However, it is unusual to meet such details in such a way, and it is in the ambassador report, and it is also unhearted that they would do so diplomates from other countries.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its associations with criminal lives led some to call her "discriminal," and confirm that the government works more as a claptocracy than a government," says the report.
"Criminal elements are enjoyed by the 'Crissha' (a term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'stream' or protection), which is provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the State Representative of the Government of Moscow, as well as the government of the city of Moscow.
"Analytics identified and triple structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov's on the top alone."
"F Security Service, Ministry of Inside and Miles are at the second degree."
"And finally at the lowest degree are normal criminals and corruption inspectors."
"It's an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty places in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report says that FSB takes money from the largest fires and the police focuses on smaller businesses.
One source said, "the owners of the trade in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Inside (so as from the organized criminal groups), because they have no more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"From this day, the protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the course."
The record says that while the choice of money is complex, the protection alone can already have difficulty; even those who pay can be arrested sometimes.
Those who don't pay enough, their trades are closed under different shops.
Medved was talking about the fight against corruption, but he admitted that he did only a little progress.
The ambassadic reports are talking about men of kitchen coffee, probably pressured with fullness, to Kremlin alone.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must be invoked to birocrates," he said in a recent conversation of Georgy Satarov, the director of the Moscow Research Team of India.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"There is no part of the political class because there are no more political classes in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
In other cases, it considers that Russia's corruption is over 300 billion dollars per year.
The land is set up to 154 places in recent investigations regarding the global consideration of the corruption of the non-governmental transparency Organization International (the land is ranged from at least to most corrupt).
The discovery of the report of the American ambassador, which has occurred in Moscow until the late dinner hours, has certainly not been invited to the Russian government of survival, although only in the measure that the Moscow lack may be accused of Luzhkov, it may be the opportunity for Kremlin to argument in the solution of the problem.
When the CNN talked with Larry King, Putin reported that the documents that WikiLeaks had published could be crafts and reacted irregularly on the statement that the American diplomatic name was Batman and Medvedeva Robin.
"The whole matter is about our mutual competition, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think that it would be done with such an arogancy, with such pressure, you understand, so nonetic."
The Veterans of the Red Khmers are required to compare with the past
In the puzzle of the light beton teacher with the walls split and stuck, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Red Khmers Ta Mok.
"All here love the Moka."
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "secretar" for his cruelness during the Rhode Khmers government, the leader remains in this remote country of Red Khmers in the northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, pounds and other infrastructures and still lives thousands of former soldiers in this organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers have delivered the governments, it is also obtained a persistent loyalty in Anlong Vengu.
In April, there was a victim in the forum of the truth and the peace has been enabled to face publicly with people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government presented a teacher who first explained the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers.
And in July, the United Nations and the Cambodge Court of First Judge of the former member of the Red Khmers, the sentence of a certain leader, the nottory of the known violent association of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years of age.
With each such progress, the disappointment has increased between the Red Khmer Veterans in Anlong Veng, which complicates the attempts to address and their attempts to join the Cambodia.
"After the former Red Khmers, there is anxiety and fear, but they are incapable of doing anything," said Chhang Youk, the leader of the documentation centre of Kambodja, independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them the life between the Red Khmer was beautiful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"He's doing it to the family."
During the Government of the Red Khmers in Kambodja, from 1975 to 1979, 1,7 million people were rectified or died in famine, disease or recycling.
When the Vietnamites attacked and with the Government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and his soldiers fled to the Cambodia border with Thailand.
There they started the resurrection that remained until the last movement in 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led party wars from their foundations in mountains and jungles in Western Kambodja, while the Mok cultivated stoupence in Anlong Vengu.
But in the middle of the ninety-years, after the peace agreement, sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. A large group of the Red Khmer fighting groups began to move to the government, which exhibited the Ieng Sary's in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died by a natural death in 1998, and the Mok, who endured, was captured by government forces in the Netherlands of Dangrek in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh Schedule in 2006 while waiting for the process.
Their machines have no longer been concerned about them, the majority of the former fights of the Red Khmers have fallen into the usual Cambodia's foreign life, and many of them are nostalgicly at the time of movement.
Although a number of elite Red Khmers have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as non-respected farmers.
"These people had only minimum benefits," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, leading the public fora throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They're circumcised by atopic agriculture ideology of the regime."
"They were growing without any idea of the consequence of trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who entered the Red Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fighted in jungle around Anlong Vengu before he was sitting as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmery was good," he said.
"That Mog enjoyed all."
"But now life is hard, because we have to make everything aware of ourselves."
The Promotional Court of Red Khmer also caused anxiety.
At the beginning of the next year, the court will come to investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of Red Khmers.
The Court has the mandate to cure the leaders of the criminals and the people responsible for crimes, but it was not said whether it would continue in the four cases.
It was just a little to relax the worries in Anlong Vengu.
Recent media speculations focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a leader of the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Government of the Red Khmers at the end of 70 years.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Centre of Documentation in Kambodja that she watched the construction of Trapeang Thma, a project that probably had lost thousands of vulnerable workers.
The recent couple of the evening, Im Chaem returned from work to the field to her wooden house on a spywayway outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to come up and the shadows appeared through the spreading grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past between the Red Khmer.
If the court would call her, she would refuse to go.
"In Kambodja, peace rules and is stable," she said.
"When other criminal trials are discovered, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who passed from the Red Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that it would come to stability if the court would search for further suspicious, even though the experts and historics did not agree.
"Cambodja has to put a deep cup and bury the past in it," said he.
But confrontation with the past is just what Kambodja needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation centre.
"The direction in the chemicals means the blinding of broken pieces," he said.
"It's our obligation to give these devastated docromades, and they could understand."
The Centre has issued the first teacher approved by the Rhode Khmer, who has 75 parties and the name of the "History of Democratic Kambodja".
It was distributed in Anlong Vengu in June as an addition to the student's history of the Ministry of School, which contains less than four parties on the Red Khmers.
Like many people in Kambodja, young people in Anlong Vengu knew only little details about the Red Khmers, even by connecting the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, student at the school in Anlong Veng said that the new school helps students understand the important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skepticly when he took the book to study home.
"My family rejects many parts of the teacher and courts," he said.
"They're suspecting because they're not sure how many people will be judged."
Such opposite makes the process of refreshment more difficult and more difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public fora, the teachers and the court begin to be influenced, and he continued.
The Red Khmer here's still a strong bowl.
Top in the Mountains Mountains, the road is grown up with a floor and wasted with a broken plastic cup that leads to a depth of black rate covered by a rear cup.
The body of Pol Pota here was burned on the pneumatic hole after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, the mobile seller on the road said that he didn't know much about the man who was in this place.
"It has a strong spirit, many local people go here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had birthdays and was planned to visit the place of the rest of Pol Pota, where a link of old bananas would bring happiness to her.
Belarus agrees that it seems to have its weapons based on uran
In a surprising victory in the campaign of President Obama on the security of nuclear material worldwide, the Belarus government announced in the middle of their resources of highly rich uran, which is the critical directory of nuclear weapons.
The Agreement was published in the joint declaration issued after the security sum of the ministerial office by Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarus Minister by Sergei Martyn.
After a year, the US government tried to convince Belarus to deliver a highly rich urane, and it seemed that the past jaw had been thrown into the rock.
But the American officials said the Washington Post that in the last two months with Belarus, a couple of firmed operations were carried out to remove 187 liberal weapons based on urane from the white-rush research facility.
This prepared the ground for the average agreement to remove the rest of the material - approximately 500 pounds, according to the officer who spoke under the submination of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The Agreement was shown to be one of the most important results of Obam's 47th national summit on nuclear security in April, which was organized in Belarus.
And it was obviously good to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place on a summit on nuclear security 2012."
"This proves that the process works," Ken Luongo, President of the Partnership for Global Security, a group supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called an agreement as "a very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that it would secure all emotional nuclear materials throughout the world to four years.
Since that time, the US government has helped six countries to avoid all its resources of highly rich uran.
Belarus will be the seventh.
Twelve countries did so for the administration of George W. Bushe.
At Obam's time, the Belarus president Alexander Lukašenko announced that his people would never give up their uran.
"We have a highly rich uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is fundamentally based on weapons and less rich uranium," said Luke.
"It's our coody... we're not going to make spinner bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're using it only for researchers, it's all."
However, Belarus reached the United States a few months ago and showed an interest in reaching the agreement.
With the obligation to remove the white-rush uran in October, he was particularly complicated because the material was easily observed, the officers reported.
He was placed on a special train that traveled more than 1 300 miles to Russian equipment for combination and liquidation, the officers said.
The second operation was closed on Monday, and it was carried out aircraft, said the officers.
The American Government for a programme spent 13 million dollars, a majority of them to deliver the Belarus Research Constitution a less rich uran that is uncomfortable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"All was very carefully coordinated and managed on the basis of confidence," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, officer of the Ministry of Energy Working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for a study on nuclear weapons non-expansion this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of urane used for the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the common declaration, seek to remove its resources until 2012.
The interruptions between Belarus and the United States have been spent throughout the years, especially because of Lucashenk's cruel repression of human rights.
But the medium declaration indicates the possibility of progressive weight.
"We welcome the progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that the effectiveness of democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is necessary for the development of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish Government did not work with years of dearness
The Spanish Government did not make delights about the airports of the carrying taxibans and the members of Al-Qaida to Guantanama through the Spanish territory, as the sender of the United States in Madrid in his telegram.
So it comes from the documents provided by the Wikileaks journal El País, where it is also written that the first representative of María Teresa Fernández de la Vegova requested to be informed by the Spanish executive and "is possible to show that he has a suitable supervision of foreign aircrafts on the Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, after the Council of Europe, where Twelve States were accused of participating in violations of human rights in Spain, a meeting was held between the United States prosecutor Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Vego.
The representative of the Prime Minister said that the European Council's communication "released the Zapater Government from the game" and that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De La Vegova stressed that Spain has no problem with the years of secret services throughout its territory.
"They only want to be informed," so that they don't "prepared," Aguirre reports in one of the documents.
Miguel Angel Moratinos also indicated to the American commander that the Spanish government "wreave to give this matter as far as possible the lowest burdens, but by being in the hands of the judges, it had a cabinet of the possibility of influence."
In January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González informed Velvyslanect that if it relates to it, he does not intend to block the initiative of the judge to ask for the disclosure of the documents of the National Secret Centre of Services (CNI) and the Defense Minister for the Years.
"This information does not contain any incriminated folder or sensible information," explained Velvyslanect after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the United States were more concerned about "a manifest coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than for the hiding of the CNI or the Defence Ministerial information.
"This coordination between independent scientists will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discretely between governments," Aguirre states.
In March 2007, on the occasion of eating the United States and the Ministry of the Interior of Alfred Pér Rubalcaby, he communicated that "although the Spanish judges are very anxious of their independence and do what they will be likely," he continued the instruction to their collaborators, "that they avoid disappointed comments with the intention of reducing pressure."
He also expresses his concerns regarding the political party of Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party, etc.) in this matter.
"In spite of its general broad orientation, our experience tells us that the Party of Popular will use any signs that the Government of Zapater has tolerated or intentionally ignored the United States negotiations that could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even if this discovery could have a negative impact on the Government of the United States," he notes.
Recognized mother-mademan's networked on the mother's "alerge"
A young woman talked about the child when she was dead, and had her blog, "Teror after Iceland"
Monica Juanatey Fernández on the Internet calls "Muki".
with this surroundings she used quickly, she communicated with her sister and at least one friend; both are from the foreign of Noia in La Coruña, from which the young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, a woman must know the emotional life that the ABC journal rebuilds with the testimony of her family members.
Thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered in 1998 in relation to Tunisia's industrialist Ivan.
They walked together one year.
Shortly after they lost, she found her pregnant.
The man wanted to know if he was his newborn child, but his former girlfriend never let her do DNA tests.
You've found a new knowledge.
Her chosen was Alberto, a young man from the nearby city of Lousam.
Their suffering was a long time.
The little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went on the Balear Islands to look for work, the little man stayed with her partner who even came to visit her to Palmy for a week.
However, because of its communication, it is evident that the relationship has fallen.
In March 2008, she's alone on Menorce and says, "Alberto is angry that I'm gone for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes that he must be with a small day and can't do what he wants."
Then she's talking about the sms report she just got, "I want you to come back this month, or give me the address to send you a child."
"If he doesn't like to leave the little man with my mother, I will take him when I come back," he says.
in May, he talks about my return to his apartment: "This week I'll go there, but I'll stay until 19, because 20 I have to go to work so that I don't get this place."
He explains that if everything's fine, he'll take his son to himself.
"It'll be with who to be with me, then with me, and I'm never gonna leave him with someone other than my mother," a doubtful intention regarding her bad relationships.
There's another contribution in July.
When he hit this report, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island of the first day of this month and was probably killed 10 is already dead.
"César's on the one side, but he's not on the other side."
"He's with me on the one side, and he likes it here, but on the other hand he walks almost every day."
They're talking about movement to Mallorc.
"It's gonna go to the summer school, so I'll take a little money for a walk."
17th salutation and complaints.
"The great mouth of Caesar who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent you no video to email, look how he wants to meet me, sex needs."
Thirty-five further report: "The boy's fine, he's going to the summer school to learn Catalanic."
There's also a report about Victor, the current partner: "He gives me money."
The Monics are on the Internet on the blows of animations and mans.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised where she let her call "Muki ex prisoner".
"Teror after it may have a motto."
The last man with whom she lived, the watchman expressed his compassion and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a free mother.
The Monica entered the province chamber yesterday in Palma, where she came from the town center to Menorce.
The companion, Carlos Maceda, noticed that the complainant doesn't remember what happened and "they hadn't got to hurt the small man."
Earlier, she admitted that Caesar was buried in the van and put his body into the bathroom.
Insurance and prosecutor require psychiatric investigations.
People would have received 4 chairs in Snave 4 and PSC (Socialist Party Catalan) would have lost 9 mandates
With the outcome of 28 November, the PP party could have the main word on the advocates in Lérida, Tarragon and Barcelona.
After the exciting growth of the votes obtained and the number of experienced missions during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalogue PP (Lid-Page Catalanska - pn.) already has an idea of the general elections, whether or not, its views are more than positive, since the number of votes in international elections is usually one of the cases of the catalyst elections.
In 2008, the Catholic people received 610.473 votes in general, while this number was only 316.222 in the 2006 autonomous elections.
Last Wednesday, the PPC (Catalonia Lid Side) has been obtained 384.091 votes.
If this visiting trend remains supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of PP electors, the analyses of this party calculated that if the PPC were to take the elections generally, the PPC could receive 12 cases from the existing 8, page CIA (Convergencia and Union, Czech Shoda and Union - etc.) would also receive 4 mandates (now they have 10) and PSC would lose at least 9 crucials (now is 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalan is essential for PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Working Party).
According to this analysis of humans, the ERC (Levic Republican Party Catalan) would have lost one rapporteur - now he has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalan) would continue to have one mandate, if possible, another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest supplier will be made in May 2011 at the opportunity of general elections, where people may also have a decision on the end of socialists' control in four main provinces and on changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputation de Barcelona), which is one of the administrative administrators with the largest estimated budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
As nationalists, people agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the Council in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive a variety and could not even turn to their traditional associations, ERC and ICV.
In view of the debate of the Republicans, it would not be impossible if this party lost its representation in the Barcelona representative, because at least 5% of votes should be obtained.
The PP party increased the number of votes obtained in four main cities and may have a determined impact in Barcelona, Lérida and Taragon.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in turning to Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party before the present age, Joseph Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP only received 500 voices more than PSC, whose senior Angel Ros has very good relationships with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met at several occasions.
People also gained other important advocates such as Badalona, Casteldels or Reus.
Currently, the PP has a representation of 34 employees in Catalonia and wants to create candidates in the most possible communities.
The Catalogue Cell has offered the Al-Qaida organisation thousands of passports
Further than the seven arrested in Barcelona, three were arrested in Thailand
Seven Pakistanians and one Nigerian who were arrested by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelone, made a jihadistick cell conducted from Thailand, which was organized by the path to the different groups of Al-Kaida, including "Tyggers of release of Tamil Ilamu" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", while the second group named atents were authors in Bombay, where 106 were killed in 2008.
The Ministry of the Inner Affairs brings an investigation of this issue of great importance, demanding to enhance the "Kampai Operation" with the weakness of the Al-Qaida pandeal camera at the international level and "limiting its operations and capacity".
Researchers believe that this cell could have been able during two years when it was active in Catalan, to send thousands of travel passengers to Thailand, where they were then passed and then added to the groups creating the criminal galaxie of the Al-Kaida Organization, so that their "fighters" could be able to travel without concern through the border in Europe and other western countries.
This diluted cell was not the only active network in Europe, and therefore these investigations other than Thai services have been made by other European police units, and it cannot be said that in the next days, there will be no difficulties in other European countries, such as the last Wednesday in Barcelona.
In relation to this operation (when the Pakistanians Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigeriac Babatunde Agunbiade) developed further in Thailand, where Pakistanians were captured Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thaijek Sir日laya Kijbum.
They were just those men who had driven the Bangkok cell sitting in Spain and other in other European countries.
The Catalogue network, whose part was deleted in 2009, stole, in particular, to the tourists the way of the pass that complied with Islamists' requirements.
This means that the documents had to be subject to men in 25 to 45 years of age, had to be valid for several years and to be without a specific view.
In the investigated documents, there is evidence that no facts that would be associated with a catalogue in Bombai, despite the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups who have accepted the passengers stolen in Spain and then identified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, a few days before this atent was sent from the Catalan Translation Agency, some thousand dollars, which were "inserted" to buy cards to mobile phones, which had been used by the members of the "command" who killed 106 people.
Police has already enjoyed a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) requires Mass to stop the fiscal agreement
The President of the PPC (Lid Party of Catalan) Alicia Sánchez-Camach had the opportunity to present it personally to Arthur Mas its submissions for which it is willing to support its introduction to President Generalitat; these submissions are compatible with those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is to rescue the economic life and risking undertakings such as the economic agreement that the leader of nationalists want to deal during their mandate.
The Chairman of the Catholic People has been held to meet Arture Mass with the certainty of 18 missionary chairs received in the elections of the last Sunday, which is more than satisfied to gain pleasure, thus candidate to the CIA to at least one of the former opposition forms remains the vote on its arrival to the office.
Perhaps the PP agrees with the future alliances that nationalists would want to keep in Snown when general elections are made, but the conversations that lead in these days with the rest of the political leaders are held in the Catholic spirit.
It is about President PP to obtain its support for the introduction to ́e, "he will have to associate with all overall and freedom of statements," as well as with the economic agreement - similar to the Baskick leader of the CIA, which he even wanted to make vote in the reference.
Both of the leaders would like to decrease the reliable political equipment of autonomous administrations and reduce the inheritance and gift taxes.
Detailed negotiations regarding Masov's introduction into Âe will be held in the PP PP Jordani Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mass has already met Joaquin Nadalem (PSC), who has promised a strong opposition, Joan Herrerou (ICV) and is today meeting Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Riverou (Ciutadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidaritat Catalana).
Director of the Geriatric Mechanism ensures that death has not occurred as a result of "the lack of measures"
The representation of the Olot center does not exclude that their career killed more than 11 clients
The leading of the Geriatric Centre of La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered pressure last night to determine what damage caused the crime behavior of Joan Vily Dilmé, a career who, while here he was employed, killed at least 11 elderly who had care.
The director of this house for the elders of Joan Sala has been delivered by the lawyer Joan Canady's lawyer, and told that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to bring an accusation against the vineyard" to the responsible for murder, but "the law and responsibility are forced to abandon this process to the competent authorities."
Besides the damage of the good name that this institution may suffer because it has not discovered sometimes criminal activities of the career, a huge threat to the home of La Caritat is now the requests for material damage, which the legal representatives of the rest of the family already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had occurred in August 2009 and that he did not stop killing since this time
The judge ordered the exhaustation of eight customers' body for elders with a doubt that in many cases, no personal doctor has been able to watch the dead, but - due to the health and the bad state of patients - everything was created on the phone.
La Caritat rejected the nationality yesterday by its director, and stressed that "the lack of measures could not be any reason for what happened."
Representative La Caritat added that "in the case there is no indication that any third person would have a doubt except the own guilty."
The man who was now surprised "The Angel of Death" admitted 11 deaths yesterday and said that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009, and about a month and a half after him killed the second age.
in this case, death caused too high dose of insulin to die, in a depth from the first case when the mixture of calm tablets was used.
Director La Caritat noted that it was complicated to control the access of the staff to medicines.
Inøjine and cocktail sedative were probably in six cases of nine, which the career used to kill patients in his efforts to defeat them from suffering.
However, the analysis currently running in the laboratory should show whether Vila is missing and seeking for his first victims less cruel death or, on the contrary, he killed them by giving a loud, as he already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat, they do not believe in the medical agency and do not exclude that the number of murderers may be higher than he was recognized, and justifie their behavior in different versions that Vila has sent to the Court with the view that he must change his acts when it appears that he killed eight people.
That is why they say that they want to be justified in order to be cleared all the areas of this matter.
The European Central Bank is threatened
Investors yesterday reacted to the threat of the President of the European Central Bank of Trichet yesterday, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to respond."
Border differences have been closed by force and the European Bank's action has decreased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, they should not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to fail - the euro just over the critical value.
What happened yesterday, it is typical for the non-liquid market that, even though it comes to decline, is rejected - but thanks to a short and very speculative position.
The investor will take a long time before he loses anxiety.
A month ago, the European Central Bank had sensed us to take back the liquidity rates today, and tomorrow it will have to be revoked for a quarter of two years.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan for the recovery of the State debt for inefficiency and the elimination of all exceptional liquidity measures within the period and to maintain unlimited access only for a week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect that the liquidity peace will be "minimum to March" and keep a three-month invitation with unlimited access to the end of this trimester to ensure the liquidity at least to June.
We also hope that they will continue to purchase debt and that they will even announce its intensity.
If he does not fill the expectation, he will create the reaction of markets from yesterday, and if they continue blindly to download the peace of liquidity, God is with us!
It was the same on the cheese in May, where they claimed that they didn't even think of the buying of debt, and it happened to the collapses of markets - the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be worthwhile and sustainable.
In May, she announced this on Monday, and in the middle she told them that she had already purchased many of them, with which she was called on the market.
The yesterday invitation was a change for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro sold only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous price.
Thus, the taxes in Portugal falled down by 30 points below, reflecting the change in the market change in Trichet.
The numbers were published in Ireland represent the losses of Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent approximately 10,000 million in short-scale value papers and other 15 000 potential, until February, they will have opportunities to be held with a privacy, otherwise they will be determined.
Although Ireland has no confidence, since the problem has not been discovered by stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable in the context of the assistance plan and will help to reduce incertitude.
However, on Friday next, the Government will need to receive the approval of the new budget by Parliament and has still no sufficient support, so it continues to rule in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has measured the tone of her statement to release the pressure in the face of the next meeting of the EU's pillars on the 14th, which is necessary to reach a political compromise that would show that we are Unions and all are on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the end of the Beethov's Hood would be joyful.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of measures that will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, employment rescue measures - it sounds like Vivaldi's four-year period.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapater explains why the Spanish storm increased by 4.5%, so doublely than the final European storms.
The reactions of the government and the Spanish National Banks have been convinced and convinced - we are obvious of the effect of surprise.
Today, we have a key invitation to a debt for three years, which will benefit from the effect of Trichet, for which we hope that there will be a big request that will help to spread doubts about our ability to refine.
A request for a salvation plan would be for Spain's self-offering.
They would give us the preparation we don't have -- in El Tesoro, there are 40,000 million in preparation, three times more than in March -- high taxes and market access would be closed to us sin day.
Nevertheless, we need to continue using the Caesar's wife's strategy - "not only to be it, but also to look like it."
We can do it.
The President of the Group of Eulen attacks the negotiations of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
Bourry in the opened conflict in the family of Alvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, does not need.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack after having taken it as "very unsignified", the legal act of El Enebro planned for 16 this month and the requested five of his seven descendants, which should try to exhaust and strengthen with the administrative authorities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia's prosecution.
David Álvarez and his sons, Jesus David and Mary José, have a legal group for the new actor of their dispute on the control of the part of the company.
The founder of the largest holding of business services does not seem to be willing to flight in his dispute on membership in the Governing Bodies of El Enebro Group.
from its Administrative Committee, five of its seven seeds, named preachers during the meeting of shareholders on 18 January of this year, and their meetings were placed in the Trade Register.
The Court of Justice of El Enebro planned for the sixteenth of this month, which was approved by the Officer of the Court of Justice No 2 in Madrid, renewed the reheavy in the Alvarez family hall.
Appeal to the Court shall be the only legal actor that guarantees the vote of the Commission.
The last step of Juan Carlose, Pabla, Emily, Marty and Elviry Alvarez's Mezquiriz David Álvarez considers "the loss of his five children served by the courtyard and the legal dumbness to strengthen and improve the deal of 18 January, which was completely invalid".
This argument will be used as a basis for the declaration of the legal attack of this action as "without meaningless".
Only the protagonists who are discretely silent have already tried to make the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group of owners near the other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls the seven descendants of David Alvarez 100%.
However, the founder of the group requires the right to use 51% by family protocols.
This matter is the key issue that the judge will have to decide when discussing the question of the court attack of the proceedings.
Red Bull triumphs in Form 1 with secret weapons from Siemens
Software is enabled to complete in vehicles in real time.
Since the time Red Bull entered the form 1 series in 2004, his history in this exceptional world is characterized by surprise and success.
In the beginning, no one took too seriously the possibility of this new neighboring team, and even in the emergency trends from recent times, all had a triumph of Ferrari Fernanda Alons.
Unless they wanted to reduce the horse capabilities of champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of Renault engine that drives his car, in the world Formule 1 was born a legend - "the secret weapons", which the multinational Siemens placed in the Red Bull hand to do so by the victory team.
In Vestista, the executive software simulating travels that the German company introduced to the market in 2007 for a very remote car sport.
Such PLM, this powerful software device, was used to monitor mounting lines throughout the world, energy carriers and high accuracy devices.
His goal is to reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, which can be avoided by unnecessary mistakes and expenditure.
PLM facilitated the development of the Canon camera, Sukhoi airport or the most flexible utility vehicles of Nissan tags.
Siegfried Russwurm, the leader of the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that use of this software device has enabled the Red Bull team to succeed "in a few hours, in the meaning of real time" amendments and performance, which are otherwise detected during trains and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992 employees were about 10 technicians who were able to perform maximally three or four perfections during one period.
in the Red Bull team today works on 180 young professionals highly identified by the executive information technology that analyses and supports every type of change in vehicles.
The leader of Siemens explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull vehicles with the exception of the engine that Renault is fully responsible for.
Materials, fuel, dynamic and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be transferred from the reality to the reality during less than 24 hours through advanced manufacturing systems using laser and highly growing car keys.
The only limit of this technical capacity is the amount of $40 million that represents the maximum that each team of Formula 1 can issue for each period of improvement of its competitiveness.
Red Bull built approximately 50 km from London the car rental of spices used to carry out and manufacture their cars.
It is about two buildings in which I have limited income - especially to journalists.
All that is playing here is considered "a great secret".
The list of participants in this project reads 580 people over two pilots - Vettela champion and Mark Webber.
The Red Bull is in Form 1 without doubt a fresh Shampion Sebastian Vettel.
Following the inconsistent energy beverages that the mark of energy beverages has placed in its own capacity in the travel areas, however, hiding other protagonists whose aid is inevaluable, and no one knows them.
Stephen Nevey said that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in research and development of vehicles contributed to 50% victory and the rest was the debt of drivers.
Currently this relationship has changed and is expected to succeed from 85% while the pilots contribute to 15%.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by calculating technology because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP shall make 20 own trades in cooperation with local distributors during two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with her business partner Pont Reyes yesterday opened her first exclusion of sales in Barcelona.
This undertaking will be the first of the 20 network of trades of 80 to 100 m2, which this transnational company plans to operate in Spain in the next two years.
These trades will also be placed in 16 already existing business houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte English.
The Vice-President of Spanish HP Helena Herrer presented as an example of a new suspended sale at the Barcelona Gran Via, which belongs to Pont Reyes, with which HP has cooperated for 30 years.
The North-Ame Employment adopted a plan for the establishment of 200 sales places in Europe until 2013, including 20 Spanish trades.
The sales were opened last week in Bukuresz (Roumania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the trade in Barcelona is the third.
Mr. Herrer didn't want to proclaim where other sales would be opened, however, admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Mr Herrer, who also leads the HP personal systems, stressed that the philosophy of trade discharge will still be the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North-Ame Company here consults the exclusive design of sales equipment (with products that are interactively tested) which will be identical in Europe.
Furthermore, HP is also involved in the assurance of the trade staff.
Helena Herrer pointed out that it would be about franchising, and she stressed that the network has been sold to "better the customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises in purchasing, service, restoration services, and even bills".
The trade in Barcelona is part of the worldly pilot pioneer programme, which aims to solve possible problems with computer devices in the guarantee.
Online service is connected to the technical centre in Maastricht, Netherlands.
"So we'll be able to solve problems that may be different to two days."
"This system is designed especially for small and medium-sized enterprises and for running customers, since large companies already have contracting technical assistance services," he stressed Helena Herrer yesterday.
Sabadell insists that he will "slade" for three years to his competitors million clients
More optimistic than the other boss, delegated member of the Bank Bank Bank Bank Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, are saying that 2011 will be an advantage for the bank, but reject the new liquidity crisis and predict the end of war.
However, it is calculated by decreasing rate rates that will be trying to compensate by covering bank taxes and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to get a million private customers for three years.
Sabadell found the way to use the next three years and could survive in unfair economic submissions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
The objective is, besides the survival without the need to return to public aid in FROB, to get a market share in a million of new private customers - respectively 700,000, if those who will eventually leave the bank - because until now and the establishment, the small and medium-sized business and large businesses were more than small customers.
This year, the bank has already obtained 250,000 private customers and 500,000 businesses.
Its market share does about private clients 3.5%, while it is more than 10% in fire customers.
The following basic ideas of the plan 2011-2013 are the obligation to produce, or is also to say frequency, to reduce the costs of the bank’s challenges when the results are presented for the period.
A few banking institutions are at this time encouraging to set their goals and publish them, since the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell this year will close its Optima program, set four years ago, although it was a three-year period, but the marketing requested an extension for the next period.
The clients who are going to leave the associated will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiol was on the fact that 2011 would be "heavy and very important".
It is thinking that the way from the crisis in Spain "will be deceived".
In addition, in two or three years, it will be "is very uncomfortable to create employment", which is added to the banking sector's survival.
And even though the passion of the war - which reduces the margin - occurs, the price of the price for the risk payable by the banks and the competitives for their own purposes to obtain liquidity is already moved to the loans prices which compensate the reduction of margins.
"The theme of liquidity and financing is structural and will represent a depth factor for credits."
"We haven't closed the couch yet, but they're very high," Guardiul admitted.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday orders to be decreased and increased prices of differences - see CincoDias of 22 and 27 November.
He also recognized that the trend in the banking company "now is a reduction of the provision", but there's a "concurrence mec".
The Sabadell Bank's plan is based on organic growth, but as a group usually does not exclude corporate operations.
It does not make sure that in Spain "the size will be demanded."
"The next year will not stay on a stone stone," he claimed.
It confirms that the needs of the ship is "decreased" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will enter between the red numbers.
And it indicates that FROB can supplie funds in the market before new measures.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive a temporary closure of markets, it continues to represent a serious problem with what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but in turn from what was in June, it is possible to get shortly financed by the repo rates, which reduces the crisis.
The CECA excludes the other wallet of fussion associated
The Director-General of the CECA refused yesterday that further furniture should be coherent, and it was again on the reorganization of the sector.
When the Spanish association process was restarted, there were several institutions that ensured that this first phase was not participating and waiting for the second round.
However, the Director-General of Spanish Confederation (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that there should be a new wall of these operations.
"I believe that the majority of the fuses has already been carried out, the integration of Cajasolu in the Banca Civica group cannot be considered a second round, which is a contract."
"The majority is completely implemented; it is possible that in place of 17 constitutions we go to 13 or 14, but all the large processes are already ready and protected by the Spanish National Bank, which was very well cooperating in this matter," noted the Director.
In its statements at ADEA's meeting (Association of leaders and Executive of Aragon - after.) Olavarrieta concluded that the concentration process is "the highest of my responsibility and we must be very peaceable, as shown in payments that at its time, not now, have been revealed in trade plans with the Spanish National Bank," he stressed.
"From 45 comparable with the average assets of 28,000 million to 17 to 75,500 million is a process that does not have comparison in the history, reducing the amount of institutions by 62%, so that these will be more and the fall in accordance with Basilea with the history," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that " there are a number of not too happy views on the slowness of the process", which indicate "a lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank does is to follow that we must be before the end of the year in term."
Director-General CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday noted that Spain has the most appropriate financial system in Europe and "probably" worldwide, and to those who doubt it, he condemned "the lack of knowledge".
The Director noted that, in the current positive economic ability, "we can be quiet" about financial institutions and compatibility and the system that has enabled "very important" concentration process and which continues "the highest of my responsibility".
He also reminded that the Spanish banking company was very good from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapater and Red German lines
Berlin decided to deploy the euro, however, set out submines for the whole Union.
The pressure on the market was due to two government responses.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero made a new adaptation measures, from decreasing taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of privacy agencies or 426 euros for unemployed unemployed, until 49% AENA (Spanish airports and aircraft management, etc.) airport manager Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgadova, with the support of the former Prime Minister Felipa Gonzál, on the other hand, joined criticisms to the office of Angela Merkel's account for its responsibility to resolve the current crisis.
How to interpret this movement?
Let us say that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
Instead, this is another point in the complex process of redefinition of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what his future should be, which suggests the idea of maintaining old traditions, which is maintained by a large part of the remaining members.
The face in the face of Europe's opposite in Germany begins to speculate about three possible ways from the crisis.
It represents a strong euro, which would be part of Germany, but also Russia or the Netherlands, while the southern States would leave the monetary zone.
The second is returning to March - although it can now appear as a shif, this version has a wide support for the public, nearly 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to the German restructuring of the euro with a more economic supervisory, the budgetary dignity, the consequences for prosecuted States, the possible payment charges for some of them, and with the extension of possible regulatory costs for the private sector.
The German position is ≥ and has already defined a period of time, so there is no space for the extracts now.
First of all, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission undertaken deficits in 2009, the German Government took up a constitutional reform from the hand to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of the dispute between what Germany considered the right (the plans of fiscal affairs and the stability of public finances) and its European partners, of course, practiced in France.
The second has shown this Central European country when Merkel was painfully protecting the decision on the salvation of Greece.
It was already the subject of a strong critical, but it is true that the political consensus in Germany and public opinions that were also published were strongly against the salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel revealed a statement when requested reform of the Convention of the European Union in order to be enabled to save a Member State and, in addition, to take part of the costs of private trustees.
This statement was interpreted as an anti-European, since the Irish crisis and all the final.
However, it was approved, although sometimes in a measured view, and during the next months, they should follow the reform process of the Union, which should be enabled since 2013.
Germany was a red line that would not be able to override.
And it tells us all that, even though it is now necessary to make measures that they obviously fail to agree too much, from this date it will end with the old operation of the euro.
In 2013, new monetary zones will be born in which States who violate the rules will be penalized firmly and may be required to report payment decharge, and the private sector will also have to take part of costs.
Germany points out that we need to take a close way of growth by increased levels of sustainability and investment, moderate needs, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and reserves.
Another option based on searches and buildings, with bitter areas in the payment budget, which was governed in Spain's growth years, simply does not intend to tolerate.
It's a offer.
And they made a mistake when they didn't understand it.
It is not only about renewal of the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want for us is much stronger.
And the worst thing is that for these submines, we might get to get out of myself.
I hope this current turbulence is going to make more calm.
And we'll use the opportunities we'll give until yard 2013.
The Prime Minister Zapatero also understood it and his two statements (the reforms promised after meeting with large companies from the last Sabbath and the yesterday announcement of new measures) believed that, through the criticism of Merkel's address, the way of thinking that things should be done right.
However, the red line that Germany took place is here, and it doesn't seem to want to move with her.
And from the options that can be considered, the release of the euro cannot be completely too serious.
Well, Germany's gonna be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sports and provisions
Finty, which Alonso and Ramos had in the campsite with Ajax, shows the consequence of never avoiding punishment.
The two players of Realu Madrid (Xabiho Alonsa and Sergia Ramose) in the Law Liga of Masters against Ajax of 23 November caused the inquisition sea to be written about whether this is not unportable and whether the EUFA should not be judged by both ballists.
As known, a few minutes before the end of the bathroom (which had their team gained) the names of players one after another were promptly lost time at the time when the faul was to play so that they could produce the court, and it showed them the other yellow card.
In this way, both players will fulfil the prescribed penalty in the next fight against Auxer - while Real Madrid ends in his group in the head - and they will be able to continue in the next phase.
Finally, the EUFA disciplinary committee granted a penalty to the trainer José Mourin's two charges and the prosecutors received money repeatedly.
The propulsion of the yellow card for obscured submines is not a new practice but is at least running in the ball.
It's so extensive that it's part of etosubal, so rules that are not written but followed.
A part of the debate in this case occurred because its team was Real Madrid (which in his hymnly glorifys beauty and honour, and who already repented for the actions of his player), and as it seems, also through the dramatization led by Mourin, which thus adds to his long history of the comedian and the provocator of another episode.
In any case, the debate is concerned about whether this type of negotiation, which is not expressly prohibited, is contrary to the sports principles, so whether such acts are to be held in law; it is, in fact, the action respecting sports rules which, however, are attempting to deal with the sense of such acts.
It decides what kind of damage such action affects the sport of the spirit.
One of the aspects of sports behavior is the physical inappropriacy of players who have not been violated in these cases, or has not reached a violent game.
Another of these features of pure games is to avoid players with their transgression against the team of advantage - which is also not here.
Then the paradox to the players of Real Madrid is the fact that it has not occurred that we are normally characterized as a forest or a detention of the rights, it has not reached a violation of the rules to avoid sanction, but this behavior should be the most clear to the purpose of the penalty.
They waited and they got the penalty.
However, another question is how the guilty of their intentional crime will benefit.
Here it is necessary to find that the concurrence is not in a disappointed position and that it does not achieve any benefit in the current stock, because the evident investigation is that the team will have less players.
And it's not even a useful strategy in another stock, because the club can count with these players.
The outcome obviously results in players' further phases of Master Liges without cards that could threaten their ability in the future stock.
However, it is the advantage of the perspectives and with a real degree of incertainty, so the team can be eliminated in the first view, and otherwise they will rebuild the penalty players, and they will go to the second road of the card, in which one card is less than in the first round.
So how the road will continue, it's totally worth it.
Soon and well, these acts are not contrary to the sports spirit, which is part of making a strategic decision that will enable maximal benefits in the rules.
In the case where we are here, the players were not intended to avoid the consequence of punishment (which would be the case of the detention of rules), but they chose more than when to deal with him.
They made strategic decisions without preventing punishment or fleeing from it.
Although there is no border between the reason and the detention of the rules, I believe that in this case it was a reasonable case.
It seems that the polemic is coming from two days: because it was two self-explications and because of the way the transfer of the instructions to their leadership.
The damage of sport principles by these actions is not so ethical as ethical as aestical.
Battle offers to organize Christmas Festivals in Barcelona
The calendar dictator concentrates the season of booking on 16 and 17.
The festival of the alone employees quickly comes to celebration, which wants to lose between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the Turkish mel or lottery, with the arrival of the coming, the pregnancy festivals, which still act as a oxygen bomb for restaurants and free time equipment in Barcelona, but because of the crisis, they have developed in the fight against customers' price decreasing: however, everyone wants to lose 20 to 30 euros for food, the questionnaires and associations of this sector are agreed.
In order to complete the number complication, the calendar concentrated this year (when Sweet Day falls on Friday) a request for a week from 13.
As it has been done since 2008, when the loss of years began, there is a lot of fires that the collective party from the budgets have cancelled.
To not leave traditions, many employees are paying a lot of feasures on their own caps.
Without prejudice, many request prices at the border of the rental, the president of the Gremi de Restauration de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
Representing the pattern of restaurant equipment is not expected to predict the celebrations of this month at this time.
"The people's going to think well before they make a booking."
"They want to go out, but if it's about the price theme, they're careful," he adds.
The trades will be good to those, "which offers quality and good service at a favorable price," he says and claims that through the crisis, customers have tendence to go down and the customer's degree now wants to lose about EUR 25.
Research in different equipment shows that the largest effort for booking is at evening 17.
The Soteras Group reports a booking boom on Friday, whereas most of the requests are to lose up to 30 euros, which have reached the offered menu, with total prices from 25 to 30 euros.
in another significant company, which Andilana, which reads 16 equipment in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and other), has brought the speciality of the annual calendar more timely booking from the beginning of November.
"We have made possible and impossible, and we have maintained prices from the remote year, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, move from 19.95 to 30 euros," he says.
In the ANS Group, which belongs to El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and all 23 businesses, it remains optimistic after the increase in profits from the second half of the year and has relatively solid views on the Christmas markets.
The sources of this company highlight that 18th hour will also be distressed on the day, since they will celebrate a pre-natural celebration between friends.
to their six group menus, they added a breakfast menu, with a budget of EUR 30 or more, as they mentioned in comparison with the remote year of the hosts' trend to lose 10% more exchange for additional items such as coffee (Spanish forest wine, etc.).
They also mentioned that firms are already discovered that they are called their employees again, and it seems that the size of the group is something more.
Vice-President of the company Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, restaurants and center of free time in Barcelon) En ♫ Goma’s starting to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the amount of booking has been "live", although the clients "shopping to the maximum".
He did not stop this income even during the Christmas celebration, to pay the payer.
Pakistan Nuclear Program was born a big disaster in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons "with more temper than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the United States of Pakistan and the Ministry of the United States, which has been published by Wikileaks, confirms an extraordinary disaster that excites the Pakistan nuclear program in Washington.
According to explaining and significant details that offer the volume of communication and the idea of the representatives of North-American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between both States in relation to nuclear security is in place to increase, and that the Asian stability country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other country".
The speciality of the Pakistan nuclear programme - that his weapons are not mounted, but are consistent with parts to disturb their destruction in the case of an attack - represents one of the main parts of Washington's attention.
This calculates highly in Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in one report before visiting the national security adviser James Jones: "Nearby certain nuclear equipment over the territory under the control of Taliban, information about the distribution of nuclear materials and the vulnerable transport of atom materials."
The increased number of persons associated with nuclear arsenales and the program of controlled shooters is not already observed only in the United States but also in Russia, as an extension and representative of being careful.
"Pakistan had to have a staff with a strong religious faith; given the incidence of the level of education and culture, the extremist organization had more opportunities to recruit people who would work in nuclear shooting programmes or shoot programmes," said Jurij Korolev from the Russian Ministry to meet their protestants from the United States.
The largest news documentation published by Julian Assange's server is the lower cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the issues of the spread of nuclear weapons and increased time for Pakistan's production of these weapons.
Depreciation issued to the ambassador in May, which communicates with Pakistan as "frustring", states: "Transparence often does not exist; offers of help remains without reply or are refused."
in the next report, Peter Lavoy, a national reporting service officer for South Asia, states that "and through economic disaster Pakistan will produce nuclear weapons as if no other country in the world."
Petterson also requests Washington that during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayaniho, "they very well explained" that "the Kyston Army has to have a quiet support for the terrorist groups".
Boss of Wikileaks
Obama names the highly established work of the responsible for the fight against the terrorism to avoid new outcomes of information.
Interpol issues a "red call" with the purpose of searching and determining where Assange could be.
All about Wikileaks and his founder of Julian Assange are a complex labyrinth where it is difficult to get real facts.
Interpol announced yesterday the "motoral call", that is, red note, to "localise and follow movement" Assangeho.
However, it is not a classic order to keep.
Furthermore, this call is not new, but dated on November 20th.
And there is nothing to do with the last outcome more than a fourth million diplomatic documents, but with accusations of sexual failure that Australian is in Sweden.
In addition, the legal representative of the Creator of Wikileaks Mark Stephens assures that "the police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assang".
It was on 20 November when the international police assembly with the seat in France Lyon issued this order to request Sweden, however, it was not published until yesterday when it received authorisation from the Swedish authorities.
For this operation, 188 countries of Interpol have instruction to identify or locate Assangeho "with the aim of allowing a temporary link and delivering it".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of persons relating to the red call, many Member States, as the organization explained, consider that the order of notes is to be enabled to carry out - this must be assured by a national police directory - especially in the case of the states of the detained issue agreement, such as in the case of Sweden and England, where, of course, Assange should be imposed.
This step was deteriorated by Assenge's lawyer, who published writings yesterday, where they declare that the ninety-year-old founder Wikileaks was willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities through video.
They also recognize that Assenge requested and then received the authorisation to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case compared to the Legendary Lavrence of Pavlovovic Berio, the Chef of Stalin's security.
"This is her, and not the legal investigation," says the letter.
While the whole world looks for him - and his mother from Australia hates the innocentness of his son - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he doesn't silence.
On Monday, he presented Skype from an unknown place of interview to the Shepherd Time magazine - in this conversation he requested the demission of the United States of Hillary Clinton.
"If it appears that it was responsible for the order of the US diplomats to conduct a spinner in the United Nations and violate the international conventions signed by the United States, it should leave," he said.
His opinion was rejected by the printing speaker of the White House yesterday by Robert Gibbs, who embraced the demand of demise as "smile and absurd".
"I'm not exactly why we should be interested in the opinion of the individual who operates the website," he announced for CNN.
Obama alone has confidenced the highly established work of responsible for the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, to restrict other documents.
The proposal of the speaking president Barack Obama to stop adding to Assange is contrary to the opinions that are proclaiming to preserve politics and comments in these days.
Peter King, a member of the Conference, who will be president of the National Security Committee since January in the Lower Room, asks the Ministership to examine the possibility to include the Wikileaks between the terrorist organization, "to be able to enter and cure everyone who would contribute financially or otherwise to help them."
Tom Flanagan, adviser of the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said Assange should be killed, and then he had to revoke.
"The two should write a recompense or use a pilot aircraft or something like that."
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a baptism priest, an ex-actor of Arkansas and a candidate to the president.
"Everyone in the government, who is responsible for the outcome of information, has been allowed to be betrayed and any other penalty than the correction would be too mild," said Fox station
Puigcercós looks for the ERC calm "smoking" on Caroda
The Republican leader will enable the party to vote secretly on its duration.
Huguet has more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós obviously found a recept to fight with a number of internal revolt in the series of ERC (Levic Republican Party Catalanska - in the case of the loss of 11 votes and half of votes).
The President of the Party is the fact that his gesture regarding demise seems to be inadequate to the proposals of the former leader Josepa Lluíse Caroda-Roviry, and also knows that the impact of this sector is now as weak as his own leader, and that he cannot absolutely make anxiety as he had with other disappointed runs.
That is why the leader of Levice will try to get new critics through the destruction that will help him to turn into the general choices.
First of all, Puigcercós told yesterday that more than 200 members of the Governing Board will be able to express secretly to his residence in Âia.
Helping the voting letters, I'm not taking up my hands.
Caroda's prosecutors will want to submit a criminal vote to the President, so they will be able to act without fear of the offences.
The boss wants to avoid divorce and details of his person.
in some discussions, he claimed that he would not be considered confirmed with half of the votes and one other, but added, without indicating the percentage that it would also not be a good outcome "by Bulgaria".
The representatives of Caroda ask for the President more than to give his own available - which they consider as a gesture that does not have any weight, since Puigcercos controls the greatest authority.
But because they do not have enough deficiency to be able to deploy demise, they will try to implement the plan from now to May.
It is therefore expected that the elaboration of a strategy reorientation document which leads to vote by the National Council on the day 18 of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercose's exchange for the promised movement of the Congress already on the sub-2011.
The leader ERC declared that "multifold voice" damages stability, and that his goal is that the organization once is able to work his spidery cover outside the closed doors.
in this context, it seems to be a significant article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After taking into consideration Puigcercos' ideology, this innovative adviser took the ready thing that the leader would be confirmed "by exchange for a few goals".
And he named them five, of whom two are.
The "composing" is an executive in order to represent at least 90% of members, which also means include new faces that are from the sector of Carod.
The second goal may be a big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should completely work with the meeting as functioning mechanism.
So it fights for the reform that it has been established to meet the conference by the delegates of the electoral votes.
With regard to the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish political system, is the aim of Puigcercos' team, which has already been fighting in this direction on the last two steps.
However, the 2008 critical meeting decided that the meeting should be considered at the special conference on reforms.
This matter is still not determined because the inside of the party has reflected the solution of this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors, it could be a moment that it would be appropriate to do this matter again and try to close it once again.

China keeps its goal to reduce glass gases
The representative of this country in the United Nations on climate changes, COP16, stressed that its country had developed exceptional efforts to reduce carbon rates, and stated that it was on its promise to reduce from 40 to 45% of glass gas until 2020.
China will comply with its promise of reducing the gas reduction by 40 to 45% in 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country in the United Nations on climate changes.
In its first public exhibition to the 16th Contracting Party of the United Nations Framework Convention on the change of climate, the Su Wei ensured that its country had developed an imminent effort to reduce carbon rates and to change its intention.
He said that his country has already invested $245 million in the last four years in the effort of reducing the gas gases.
However, he realized that China would not change its goal and will continue to work together with the international community.
He referred to that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institutional building and pilot programmes.
At all these points, he has already mentioned progress, including the low-approval of the new Energy Law, which includes the objectives of reducing the gas reduction.
He further highlighted that the Federal Authorities in China cooperated coordinatedly with the authorities of the provincial and local authorities to achieve their objectives regarding energy relief, energy efficiency and reduction.
The following, as he has communicated, are in progress or have already been completed by various several-yearly plans financed by both the Chinese government and the Governments of other States.
For example, it was, as he said, on the Energy Effect Programme, which was established in the past five years, which had received investments from the United Nations, governments and private initiatives.
The provinced project of climate changes is also running, further the draft exchange of rubber for sustainable rubbers and the mixing and adaptation projects, explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the professional adviser of this country for climate changes, said that China's efforts were more important than generally thinking.
For example, he calculated that the glass gases of one population represent 6 tons in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share in the areas.
It also has developed unprecedented efforts on energy use - for example, in the past five years, it has increased the energy efficiency of 20% and expects to have further progress in 2020.
Legal Exclusion Espina: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN (Partido Action National, Czech the National Action Party, etc.) said that the former president of this party was authorised to request the National Order Committee of its rights.
The National Chairman of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, noted that the exhibition of Manuel Espy Barrientose was lawful and that the former president of this party was authorised to return to the National Order Commission and request his rights.
in the discussion that was established before the introduction of a meeting by the State Gabin Cué Monteagud said that Espina's discharge is, in any case, a decision taken at the local level.
"This is the autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to return in his case with the complaint to the Order Committee of the National Council in order to act on the decision made by the competent authority."
He further explained that there is no time to think for 2012 and that it has never been at the negotiating table on the presidential alliance candidate.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that the PAN will come out of the internal elections of the following 4 and 5.
"This (aliance in 2012) is a theme that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not at the time, was a purpose for local elections that were successful and fulfilled its own election," he subsequently said.
President PAN said that there are 71 years of dialogue on his side, and therefore "We are not treated by the internal competition, but we are hard and strengthening it," he added.
He said that the Committee would be able to choose the best president or president for three years, which the PAN will deserve for the next three years, so he will send the staff to the "who the Committee is appointed".
"I'm therefore absolutely quiet and released, everyone of these five with pride, I'll give the president's office."
He said that the rebellion that the party mentioned in the last elections of July will be reflected in the future courses, although "not yet time to think for 2012".
"Now you need to carry out Gabine Cué in this job."
in this regard he stressed that these three governments, who have roots in the alians in Oaxace, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, 'they have been placed in them a lot of expectations and complaints, and I am sure that Gabino is able to do this.'
When we asked her about the criticisms of President Felipe Calderón from Pri (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech the Revolutional Institution Party, etc.) because of his statements in four years of government, César Nava invited the members of PRI to think about the six-year-old ex-Presidents Ernesto Zedilla and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
"When the governments of Zedilla and Salinase were better than the Government of Foxe and ́Derone, so let them turn back to them, let them go out of their street," he advised.
He stated that the Federal Executive Boss had the right to express himself as he acted during the event in the National Audit, since no roof or censure is used in this country.
Obama promotes on Twitter law to support students without documents
"If you assume that the approval of the Dream Act law is right, let your senators and advise them to approve this law," the American president of the social network twittered.
President Barack Obama has joined the national mobilisation to support Dream Act law, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you assume the approval of the Dream Act law is right, let your senators and find that they will approve this law," obama Twitter.
His short report warns on the Internet reference to a comprehensive document that requests the public to connect the senators immediately, since the vote on this law is close.
"Because it is expected that the vote will run soon, it's now a moment, let your opinion be stuck," she points out.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators had threatened the blocking of any legal approval, unless an extension of tax reduction from Bush's era and the financing of the government had been approved.
Such blocking, announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act law and other projects, such as the new relationship with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons called START.
When questioned about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other opinions, the President's speaker said that as soon as the fiscal subject is resolved, he would set up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe it's still enough time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax matter before the end of the year..."
I believe we can reach agreements in this matter at some time and then we will be able to plan a series of final issues," he said.
The leader of the Democratic Senate Harry Reid announced on Wednesday that he would request "the vote on the closed debate" on the Dream Act law, so that we could vote on the legalization of students without documents from the next Thursday, although it is more likely the next week.
The Senator approval of Dream Act or the law of "American dream" would legalize approximately 800 000 young people who have been in the United States before 16 years of adoption, lived in the country during the last five years and were adopted in the higher education institution or in the army.
However, the representatives are able to approve 60 votes, so they are helping some of the Republicans, so the organization of its proposals acts intensely in order to ensure the approval of this law.
Democracy, whose Dream Act supports, has 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, claimed to vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indian, expressed his support for this law.
Thus, the representatives of the draam Act will receive a number of republicans in the case that other democrats would decide to refuse us.
Among the Republican senators, with which the most negotiated staff, are Senators from Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as a resorting senator from Florida George Lemieux, who supplemented the mandate of Senator Mela Martínez.
Other republicians who have supported Dream Act in the past are Orrin Ha's of Utah and Kay Bailey Hu'ison from Texas, but they have told you that the next will not support it anymore.
The next republican who supported us, John Mccain, has not yet been expressed at this point.
Although the Sneam Representatives are attached to another version, according to the most of the analytics, Dream Act will lead to the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
with a finger inserted into ́na ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "input finger into ́na" is the period of the Czechish "eat a cup on the head - then overlook.)
The second round of the cycle of Rejoicing from the language was a change where the literary cycle of the representation was translated
"I understand the sex in the language, but... Finger in the language? What is expected from me?" asked the writer Louisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Rejoice from the language, the cycle that celebrates the written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used in this opportunity as a subtitle (on the other board they explained the theme of Sex in the language).
The finger to the "treat us to hard", the argentinian writer sent us to the public, especially of young people who meet at the International Caribbean Water in Guadalajar, to listen to this debate at the cowlet table, moderated Marisol Schultzo, and with Valenzuel, Sergia Ramír, Mayry Monter and Louise García Monter.
Louisa Valenzuel readed the text that Gonzalu Celori, which Schultz marked after a wonderful story in which Louisa was in the first person as a protagonist in search of the "worm" comes from the doctor, from which she is not answered, even if she stops the same history.
"Patience is not my strong page, maybe it'll be my."
Finally, after the frustration of a traumatologist who took her breathe on the road, but explained that it wasn't a deep termin, it is psychoanalytic that reveals the secret: "The morning represents it very distressed and symbolic is yesva".
The protagonist was distracted and came to the conclusion that "only it was able to know that it was so disappointed and that it doesn't exist", but it was convinced that joy and stress in the language must go together in the hands.
The writer of Valenzuel played a battle.
The Nikaragator Sergio Ramírez also came out with a pleasant story called Glory invention, in which the finger is not nominated in ́, but at a moment it will appear.
with the elements of the magical realism, the story of the glorious magic magician, which played darkness, brought people back who went far away, or held the honour that one girl lost, this story that then turned to speak to America, a big Roman, in which his own cronikers who told her from the beginning were missing, and here is quoted by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the relief in the report of the producers.
"Cervantes, who found us all (which writers), laughed with a finished witness that was presented as a story, but in other ways, it was never able to explain the story of America with such education that even had been acquired of the study."
However, he highlighted, "they are foolish and liars who have more fantasy" and just where it lies and where it doesn't know what the story belongs to one group and what the other, it reaches the fiktivity of its top.
It's actually called "cervanty tradition".
"By his link we have what we have."
Then Mayra Monter highlighted and appreciated the diversity of interpretation that the invitation of the International Renewable Commander has enabled with its word Finger to ́na.
The Cubaan-Portoric writer has shown her finger on a big social violence that passes through her country - and shares it in Latin America - and is a researcher of business disputes and drug sales.
"I think goodness, good poesi and good songs are closed by the silent compromises that are of course not intended," she said after she said that the reality of the reality is communication and dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction".
The Spanish boss Luis García Montero closed tonight, whose exhibition also was "at this finger to the writer's binding writer".
He said that in the world that lives fast, also in intellectual habits and controls that overcome dogmatisms, it is expected to "hide small none after every attachment, and after every interruption it is a small yes."
"And they were our gentlemen of thoughts and realities we have to color: and to color it means many times to put a finger into a ́na and to wear the only ones that are much more pleasing, because he thinks in carrier, black white, in fixed ideas and without color, and to wear the authorities that prefer this black white world," he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano follows his first title
Ruben Omar Romano reads three breaks in the final, during the career, he lived good and bad, but has already been able to reach at three opportunities for a decision-making series.
In Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, two different characteristics of their technicians, the teams that have a clear division between themselves in the outputs.
Ruben Omar Romano reads three infringements in the final, during the career, he lived good and bad, but has been able to reach at three opportunities for a decision-making series, but until now he has gone with a non-admissible, and this is why this chance is exceptional.
The Argentinan had to satisfy the silver medal, remained a step for the victory and played qualifiedly with the same team of the following finals.
As a trainer, the Santiago strategy reached its first final at the openturn 2002 tour, when he was in the hand of the Morelia club, with which he was in total 4-2 against Toluca; then in Turnship Others 2003, he replaced the decision-making course and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
With the Santos Laguna club in Torneo Bicentenario 2010 tour, again against "Devils" from Toluca, Ruben suffered a wound again, although his team was played against "Decenaries" (a further survival of the Deportivo Toluca club - after.) after 210 minutes of the game undecisively 2-2, after a series of criminal shoots, he had two opportunities to save the title, but finally his three players passed from 11 steps and thus suffered to turn on 4-3.
Ruben has already lost two finals against the Red Devils of Toluca and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would have dismissed the same condemnation and lost the curse, and he could first celebrate the title, although he says that it is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a victor, I don't want to lamatis, this is for the club, for the weight I've been binding, and the title would, of course, be for me, but the first is the most important," the trainer expressed himself when he was asked about the number that is speaking in the final against him.
in life memory has the previous finals, in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, "we have learned that until the decision is unscriptural, we cannot celebrate, we must be prepared for action, even players, because we were already ready to go out to celebrate, and I think we have learned in this until the stock ends, we cannot celebrate."
It doesn't care that this series could be decided in criminal shootings, they will say to their players: "You're never trying to reach a series of criminal coppers, trying to finish at normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and we should be prepared for it, in the past tour, we were prepared, despite all of this, but the judgment has taken a bad thing, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when the title was in our hands, but we've lost it, that's what we have left in us and hope that this time will not come to something like this."
Romano has to stop being the other one in his hand and try the first glory that the titles bring.

with a new procedure, the number of applicants will have to return to the Centre of Services for Visa Requests (reduction from English ASC) before talking to the Consular Division.
The staff from the ASC will remove the biometric information of the applicant and they will be evaluated by the Consular Division before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages between which the following are calculated:
The total expenditure for the establishment of visa shall be lower than the payment for the agreement of the meeting, the second for the processing of the application and other for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall only pay the only payment to cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to 140 dollars for tourism visa, 150 dollars for cases of demand (including for temporary work) and 390 dollars for visa for businessers and investors.
People who want to restore their vision must decide the conversation with the consular officer, but they only turn to the closest ASC where they will present their documents and will be rejected by their fingerprints.
Since biometric information will be deleted in the ASC, the applicants who will request a second meeting with the Consular Division, there will be a shorter time than in the past.
Similarly, those who will ask for visa on consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will already pay additional payment for the service of $26.

NASA will notify the discovery of alien life
The American Cosmic Agency called tomorrow pressure to present an outcome that could cause a disaster in searching for foreign life.
The National Aviation and University Authority (NASA) of the United States will notify tomorrow, Thursday, astrobiological discovery that could confirm the existence of alien life.
Revelation will be presented tomorrow at 13 hours of experts on astrobiology, and it will take place in a study of pê, evolution, spread and future of life in the universe, printing in the NASA seat in Washington.
When she invited the journalist, NASA noticed that she would represent "the discovery that causes a disaster in searching for foreign life", which raised the speculation of experts from other countries.
Revelation could confirm the theory that there are other creatures, other than us, living in unhostly submissions, which have been considered inhabitable, and who could imagine the possibility of one of them to become intelligent creatures, such as people, if the increasing submissions in which they live.
According to the opinion, a microbe found at the bottom of the Lake Mono in the Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in a ≥ that was considered too eating for any form of life, since the lake is rich to arsen.
The creation of arsen in a similar way uses his life, and it just increases the probability that a similar life could exist on other planets that have no atmosphere on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use in their metabolism arzen, it will be proved that " there is a different life form that is different from what we know."
The Cosmic Agency will announce the date of discoveries tomorrow.
Conference with Pamela Conradva, attending geobiolog, studying the possibility of life on Mars; the biologist Steven Benner, one of the doctors who examine Titan (the greatest month of Saturna) with the perspective that his chemical storage is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patron produce opposition block
Reforms of the Constitutional Conference Act lead to the arrival of bipartism.
The 60th parliamentary period has not yet been started when an opposition block was raised in Congress, the leader of the PRD party (Partido de la Revolution Democracy, Czech "Strana Democracy Revolution" - later, PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Strana Work" - after.), Convergencia (Cheesic "Sodium" etc.) and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalve, who was declared independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" to Snembalvna.
Before starting the 60th meeting of the 60th parliamentary period Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez from Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patrón Montalvo "inspired" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it rejects them.
This reform, repeatedly, starts the "bapartism" because it will now be two people from the same number of sides who will control the Congress.
These four lawyers, together with Gloria Margarito Santos Aquilar, the coordinator of PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Brits from the PAN (Partido Action, Czech National Action Party) and Luis Cárdenas Fonsecou in Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo noted that these reforms constitute institutionally political marginality from the Pri (Partido Revolutionary Institutional Party, Czech "Revolutional Institution Party") and PAN.
He noted that during the following days they will talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the schemes based on political will, and if they do not have it, these two parties will be detailed again with the end of the opposition coals.
"When she comes here, I'm looking at it because we're exhausted from any decision, they don't even want to consider the opinion of the finals."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez from Convergencia stated that they agree with PRD, PT and Patron, and therefore they will create a multilateral group.
It can't be allowed, he continued to be "double".
Aspiration reform of the law is not to be an unfair bipartism in Congress.
This group begins with five legislators and its members now discuss with other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes as added by Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that Kongres was currently "building" two - in the PAN and Pri's trailer.
"Earlier, only one side controlled her, two are divided today."
Patron Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the lawyer to give him a place at the acting table.
"In order to make us five deals that probably will be nine, but just now we are seen at five, we haven't remained for the sake of cloud agreements, each of us in another group, and we have found a place at the action table, because the problem is that in the reform that they have created and agreed, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform."
The additional 200 thousand weights are issued for "supplyer"
The workshops in Mazatlán will pay another check of the debated owner of the company delivering electrical.
Another check on something more than 200 thousand weights was sent to the advocate to Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
This amount is paid by the owner of the company who provides electrical material shall be exposed to 1.200,000 weights.
According to the board's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November this year, was exposed to a volume of 200.144,56 weights and as its subject was referred to as "equilibration of unreductional payments".
The poster Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the province would pay this supplier, followed by the Supreme State Revision Authority for sale at high prices, another interest.
What wasn't said, the total amount that was eating is still debt, and how many checks still will be sent in the benefits of Camach Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased now, it only applies what we have to eat, just as the final suppliers," he said in one conversation.
The final checks were "reopened" in the last fourth year: 24 September, 2 October 15, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this undertaking has not been published in the Governing Board, as it sets out the law in the case of the Superior State Revision Authority to avoid using other administrative authorities, the depositary has not reuse the services of the Board supplier.
In the past, after July 25, the journal of Noroeste published the check reviews of his suppliers, which discovered that in the period from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year old period of Jorge Abel López Sancheze, the city of Camach Palazuelelos paid over 10 million weights in 42 checks.
It also performed transactions with Jumapam, where she incased checks for more than 3 million weights.
Tourist places needed maintenance
Tourist managers are depressed in relation to the accident of the tourist's tourist because of the bad state of the Sanchez Taboady vicinity in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of the tourist to the seat of Sanchez Taboady, the tourist sector in Mazatlán requests the Authority to take attention and places that are in the wrong condition and do not show a presentation in the good light.
Salvador Barraz Rubio, President of the Trade Association of the Trade Zona Dorada, noted that they repeatedly requested to take care of the destination, and that is bad that the tourists call here to be replaced by new activities or roads.
He noted that the bad state of streets and travellers affects tourists who are coming here and see a disagreement, which unnecessaryly affects nearby businesses.
"The politicians don't know how to close the business for one day, and they don't have any idea of the markets they're avoiding, otherwise these matters would not solve so and without the correct planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused the lack of preventive measures and maintenance from the Council.
"The Council will have to take responsibility and avoid repeating something like this, to prevent maintenance, not only to comply with existing commitments," he expressed.
They wanted to enjoy a pure city because not only because we are tourists, to maintain, even as we are a people who deserve a clean dwelling, the adviser should change its town maintenance strategy."
There are also other places that look disappointed and poverty, noticed, for example, the Mazatlan Emblém and El Venadito (monument, jelena socha - later.).
"To come to the tourists today, not only to promote, it is necessary to offer a good product, so a city that is a cleanness of its beaches and streets where the continuous maintenance of tourist attacks is carried out," he said.
"There is not the needed attention here, and these facts highlight something that is well known to all, the maintenance is missing.
He spoke about a number of places that must be done in cooperation with the adviser, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and all right to be attractive because he has a tourist potential.
Raúl Ller Martínez, a subsecret of turism promotion, said that the salvation of tourist sites in Mazatlán is inappropriate because they are not correctly used and do not do good idea.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces, which, however, will need first to be corrected, and these places will be detained and could be introduced into the list that we have to promote."
IP requests the Congress outcome
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, would like to take great responsibility by the lawyers in searching for better Sinaloy, in different challenges to be addressed.
The European Parliament requires a business sector in Mazatlán, without agreement between the parties and the State's executive, because Sinaloa is dismissed in the crowds and faces of big problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period composed of seven political forces, 19th sentences Pri, 13th of PAN, three of the Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergencia and the last of the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of the Congress is to be able to carry out the right leadership, with the commitments to the company and the different obligations required by the responsible legislative work, and that they are able to repeat the same pages and parentalism patterns.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), has sought to take great responsibility from the recent 40 recently chosen Congress commitments and was an example of the way towards the better Sinaloa at different challenges to which he is concerned.
"We expect the lawyers to exercise their rights without agreement between the parties, because they are usually making measures to promote their own interests and are still the karnivals of governments and leaders of the Parliamentary Group."
Therefore, he said that it was necessary to confirm the obligation to establish the necessary claims that would move the Governing Board forward according to the order.
"We want them to carry out a lot of work and are primarily committed to companies and sectors because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloy who gave them their voice in the past options of confidence."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will collect all powers in trying to achieve the economic growth of the country because the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important is to encourage economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support the development of workplaces in a certain way."
It is about the road movement, requesting new legislators to give him more weight in the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I learned that this is the Ministry with another latest budget, which is inappropriate because it is a significant economic activity, a contributing currency and investment, which will also cohere directly with agriculture."
Furthermore, the Congress should help to add the State to security and help with the alcohol law that has not been able to be resolved in the previous parliamentary areas.
Three Kings are looking for.
Boys, cars and cars are together with other players in the list of children's desires in the family of the Coronad Valenzuel.
For their parents it will be difficult to fulfill their imaginations as their household reads exactly 12 people and one box.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not work on that Kašpar, Melichar and Balthazar will make them games and clothes that they want.
The family lives in a humiliated residence in the foreign of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, because the father has no longer work.
"We sometimes have it hard because the husband doesn't have happiness, but we're selling mandarins and brambores... afternoon I'm going out with "players" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetan Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of children.
Four-year Adelaida wants a girl or a round, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like Lady Barbie.
It's about the decades of José Alfred, he'd like to have a "monster" car for a while, and for his eight monthly brother Jesuse Cayetan would like a clothes in size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) "I'd like this monster car, but I told him, "We'll see the son" because he was very dear," he's waxed up with Cayetan's smuggling.
For older children who were just at school, there would be ideal clothes and bottles.
Maria Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a size of 12, 10 - year - old Isaiah size 10, where the eight - year - old Miguel has a size 8.
Jose Juan's 14-year-old missed tennis, so he'd have a couple of five and a half or six.
If you want to help fill the dreams of children from the family of the Coronads Valenzuel, you can participate in the campaign "Search for Three Kings", and at the receipt of the Noroeste journal to offer gifts or money in preparation.
14 Increasing drug trademakers arrested
Ten views were carried out in Estonia, in the middle of the elimination of the network for production and sale of Indian canopy.
Fourteen persons were arrested and headed with different accusations.
The reviews were running in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places that served to produce drugs.
"And approximately 750 ships of Indian canopy, four pounds of hash, money and equipment that served to produce was fun," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaker police in Quebec.
In general, eleven men and three women were arrested, both of them the heads of the whole network, two of Sherbrook's men.
The arrested persons had to be traveled into a legal palace in Sherbrook after their arrest.
They could be charged by the production of Indian canopy, its carrying with the purpose of negotiating with it, striking and stealing, among others.
These reviews were followed after an investigation, which continued in the year.
"The information we received from the public and allowed us to access these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
This police operation was held to 70 police officers of the regional investigation of the city of Estonia, the State police of Quebec, the State police in Sherbrook and the Police Government of Sherbrooku Memomagog.
Illegality will be able to continue without problems.
In view of the law of conservators that, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships imposed by illegal movers, it will be obviously powerful while all three opposition parties in the centre have notified that they cannot support it.
"It's an exciting measure that I'm upset on Chart."
"I'm directly on the side of the side that built a jungle under your feet, "affirmed the leader of the liberals Michael Ignativef, circumcised lawyers after the weekly meeting of the week du cacus.
The Liberal Market is on the fact that we are in law, as it is proposed, the law that would enable any person who is buriing from the ship, identified as a ship that transfers illegal mover, to violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
The Chef of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also pointed out that he can't support our law because he's thinking about the wrong goal.
"We are opposed and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed, so we will see what the government will do," Mr Duceppe said.
The NPD critical on the issue of the problem of the mobility, Olivia Chow, refused the criticisms that wanted her side to be not quite strong enough in the matter of illegal incentive.
"Neo-democracy agree with this, and they have adopted measures against the translators of illegal movers, and that is what we consider as a narrow part of the other law, C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We don't support the law of the conservators because it's throwing the wine on the flights and putting the child's income for at least one year," explained Mrs. Chow.
Jason Kenney's Immigration Minister has accused the opposition parties.
"Canada's sentences are not tolerating this kind of illegality, these criminal transactions that Canada takes on a man and acts with it as a patrol."
It expects Canada to take major measures, Minister Kenney responded.
The Government did not announce the vote on its confidence in law, which could lead the country to the elections leading to its refusal.
However, one conservator said to the QMI Agency that the Government would ask for vote to answer each Member who is opposed to his position before his electors.
New unit does not mean uniqueness
Even though it is possible to create a continuous unit for the fight against corruption and collusion, many observers continue to require the establishment of a public investigation commission for the issue.
The Ministry of Public Security, Robert Dutil, is attempting to not forget this idea: Quebec is going to do this problem with the Department of Investigation from New York already in January the next year.
Metropole has been available for a anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why the Tuesday announcement of no one of us was surprised.
It is necessary to notify that this measures were not negotiated at the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, it was not necessary that the public security criticism, PQ Stéphane Bergeron, examined this notification as "the king of the clouke" and "the amateur solution to the knee".
Minister Dutil himself replied to those fearing that political power has too big effect on my future of unit.
"They'll be satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the outcome when we announce it."
"We're thinking about this problem."
For the President CSQ, Rejeana Parenta, nothing can replace the establishment of witnesses in public transmission.
"In addition, Mr Charest claims that he does not want to create this investigation committee, and people think like you and me that he hid something," explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of the investigation committee is demise Jeana Charesta," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and policies in the Constitution for the Education of High State Officials.
In order to get out of this blind hall, he proposed Quebec to give special power to the general inspector to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the general inspector," he decided.
It also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same power as the Commissioners who are allowing people to witness.
The creation of a continuous work of the group is not the only idea in the Charest Government's records.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Treasury Law so that it would be better adapted to this type of criminal activity.
This requirement would be removed from the potential for the operation of Marteau (Cladivo), which informed the Minister for Justice Jean-Marca Fournier that the legality of this type of investigation is not explicit.
The Federal Ministry of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently undertaken by some amendments related to this writing.
In the Jaro 2001 operation, which reached a group of motorists, although the Treasury Law has not yet been modified, 131 were arrested.
The Ottawa followed the changes in the gangster Law.
The rivers are under a hard supervision.
Several water flows have been severely controlled from the depth of strong snakes falling from Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In the middle of the afternoon, in Shawinigan, Maurice, it came to the floor.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
Tonight the next season of the ground in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road is lost.
Since Tuesday to the midnight, several regions of a strong snake have been thrown from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 miles were not expected from today to Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The impacts on the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were most insected.
It could fall up to 100 miles.
If we count these snares with a snow-snake snow that is replaced in some sectors, we can be scared in some water flows.
Quebec's salvation service announced in the middle of the evening warning against the danger of the rivers of Ouareau and Achigan, Lanaudière.
The Greeks north, in Saint-Jerom, in the forests of Laurentides, and in Chéne, in Lotbinière, became the subject of the springs and continuous controls.
In Vinga de Lanaudière, some lakes divorced, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, one preliminary pool was observed by the follow-up of strong rain.
Two residues had to be evacuated preventively.
In Outaouais, some lakes from the sea caused the closure of some roads, especially in the foreign of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Reserve service is ready and supervised by the security adviser, Annik Bouchard.
The Quebeck Center for Preliminary Preliminary was issued in the middle of warning against the strong rivers, particularly Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
The Quebec Voice Moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a long disaster before the Canadian Council for the standards of vote and television (RRTV) due to contradictions relating to social assistance and Haitians and, as well as for a brutal expression during the sending.
The Board for Vote and Television judges that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98,1 FM should have the right to express their opinions, but some statements included "inaccurate information on social assistance and an inappropriate negative explanation of Haitian's brutal expression which does not correspond to the sentence of the day".
The Council also concluded that the debate on suicide, namely the sending of both persons who have taken life, did not violate the rules for voting.
The voting and television Council has received a number of comments made during the transmission sent between 2008 and 2010.
The decision was made after the complaint of the Common Fountain of Receivers of the Social Aid of Quebec.
The group claimed that the amounts listed in the sending were inexact.
The operators must provide adequate information, not false.
About suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont thought that suicide was a gate of disappointment.
The majority of the Commission members concluded that the transmission of the report was that suicide could not be chased as a solution to the issues of daily life.
"The majority of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of the Dupont Sea Notices have reached delicately and appropriately topics."
No expenditure has been brought to him.
The final dispute was about the statement followed after landing in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort went into the medical screen, which caused many reactions.
The CHOI reported that he did not send any gift to help the Haitians, because we can't be sure that the needs will get money.
The Commission believes that these comments were not illegal, but that their cumulatives constitute an inappropriately negative image of Haitian.
"I've already opened my three-day division of that thing."
"My list is no longer a half a year," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use to send brutal expressions.
Each CHOI-FM voting vote worked "on its duties".
For a station that will have to notify this decision once during the main transmission within three days, the investigations are minimum.

450 million free of public competition
Hydro-Quebec agreed after a mutual agreement of 450 million with engineering companies for Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this lavine, more than 100 contracts is the consortium created with the BPR, Dessau, the Group SM and Axor, which has obtained the most important contract, contract on the management of the whole project at a total of $295 million without public competition.
This consortium, named Energia Gerance, was completed in 2004 in conjunction with the choice of Hydro-Quebec to grant its responsibility to the private sector for the management of this significant hydroelectric project at $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Consortium "Energy gerance" obtained a lucracy contract without any public competition.
For Quebeck, the complaint to the consortium of companies is a serious ethical problem before us, which risks the distortion of competition and causes increased prices.
"It's a new way to carry out the collusion and to distort competition."
"It means that people, the side agreements no longer do secretly, do it openly today," reported yesterday PQ Sylvain Simard on printing.
About something earlier, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Conference, because he says that it is hard to wear how public interest can be sold so.
The Ministry of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, last afternoon, appealing to this Colesion Treaty.
"I have my own way," she crossed and claimed that PQ was "inconscient" and "reached accuracy".
She said "it would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recept for the creation of consortion is a running practice worldwide.
It is the customs of the alignment limited in time that allows two or several undertakings to buy their mutual expertise in order to respond to the challenge to provide proposals for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complicated with regard to the range of work.
The situation is already running and must be distributed until 2012.
However, it was recognised without competition; it was trade.
It is also necessary to admit that the formula of consortion is no longer a exception in Quebec, not even in relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir discovered last week, the formula of consortion in engineering advice is the subject of investigation in the government.
If we go through the chebec fires trade register, it will enable us to discover more than 200 consorties, while some seem to be created.
This company Dessau works in partnership with its main competitors; let's call CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are tens, leads to one and the same legal person, and it's Dessau.
It is about Energia gerance, ministerial Normandeau, in particular the fact that "the territory of La Baie James is a typical special dynamic of work forces and that Hydro-Quebec reacts to it since the 70s".
Gla's Patron of Eastmain's project, Real Laporte, from the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), made an explanation that will cause us to save the head of the overlining that the project management was closed after a mutual agreement.
"If you go to the public competition and if there are few competitors to offer a offer, your offered prices may be higher."
"You have two options to choose: that you collect people who figure in that prohibition as competitors, and that you say, "Let us close an agreement with a satisfying and with a good price."
"But the main idea is that the price is not important, but the competence of people," Mr Laporte confirmed.
This consortium granted to Energia gerance is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000, which has received the Quebec Party.
The contracts were closed by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification of Le Devoir, he calculated 109 engineering advisory contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with firms or their staff, in particular with the laborators, performing the analysis of ground samples.
SNC-Lavalin took 22 contracts, from which Genivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without a share in the "Energy Gearance".
All contracts were closed.
Dohromades read 449 783 344 dollars, in terms of the contract with the Energy Gerance company at 295 131 564 dollars.
Sylvain Simard noted that four companies who are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "very well known by the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau reported that PQ was also connected to companies that "finance it" before she said that it was more about its management work.
Barometer responsible needs - "Green" label does not excite confidence
More green, but increasingly skeptic.
The Quebec needs a very little confidence in the sustainable development actors, but also on the "unseen" marks and the environmental certificate, in order to handle it accordingly in the selection of products.
The worst thing is that, even though we buy ourselves in the Media Universe, which calls us for a socially responsibility consumer, this Media Universe calls over the lack of information, unfaithfulness of obligations, which even as fast for its commitment, states Barometer the responsible needs that the first article has gone out yesterday.
Although in 2010 the so-called Community responsible products increased, the Quebec people who tried to sell them, however, do not believe them too much
Two thirds of us say in the absence that they don't believe the promises of fire about life, just because the green public of the company finds a measurement tool that the Observator has developed the universal responsible needs in Sherbrooke.
Other discovery: half of the consumers doubts the ability of official certificates based on such fair products, but also the non-equivalentity of products and labels that are marked as an ecological responsibility indicates Barometre.
In the same way, the policy debate on this theme is adopted as a series of only 14.6% of Quebec's people.
However, the information on the responsibilities seems to be the primary basis for stimulating this page of needs currently lived at the third part of the Quebec consumers.
Actually, the vacuum and the suspicious nature of information would measure over 46% of the consumers.
This is the second raw that Barometer identified at the higher price of these products.
Lastly, the third inhabitant of Quebekuse puts incrediblely on the information given on the manufacturers or the "green" services we are looking for, and they have allowed them to pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, half of the consumers was willing to change their developments and, in particular, to change the label of one or several products that would respond to their convictions.
The total 61% of them prefered the purchases in trademakers from their quarter and gave the advantage of the purchase of food developed in their region, states Barometer.
More "red" and responsible - index responsible needs has reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Quebeku is presented as King of recycling, who is seeking the least impact on life by careing for the protection of animals.
But their social and environmental conscience obviously remained outside their car, states Barometer: In 2010, at least 28% of Quebec's people have noticed that they are using a hot transport or that they recommend the use of a car to drive at least two persons in respect of the protection of the nature.
The roof and round also supported 39.1% of those who were in this comprehensive behaviour, who used this.
State loan for eXcentris complication purchase
The Government of Quebec, which we have requested for the financial cost of purchasing the eXcentris Communication and Parallelle, agrees to participate, but only up to the loan.
The Persian company Angus et le Parallèle, who requested a gift of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to purchase a cinematographic complex on the Saint-Laurent bulvary and showed its sending as a lovers of film art, did not find what she demanded.
The government accepts that it will be included in the documentation, but for its own submissions.
In addition to the expected gift of Quebec’s government’s loan, which would finally be lower, it was an expectation that could establish a basis for life-capacity solutions for advantaged submins and resources from the country's funeral.
The action plan and request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebeke, but the requests were already revised for decrease.
Na· and the Action Plan sent to the Ministry of the Community for Development of Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, which is conducting a cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the opposite government came to SODEC on Wednesday.
Le Parallèle et日us has time until 31 years to answer.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the State must be truly rejected.
Remember that the Chinese and cinematographic centers association in Quebec was contrary to the direct investment of the State in order to support the eXcentris recovery, saying that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance projects relating to unnecessaryness when it did not do this for other cinema sales.
However, a number of the debates had been requested for primary economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his kine space during ten years of film art after he himself financed the building of a complex, which could be a result of changes from the State’s financial Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is crying in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to get a permanent client.
Company et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his head, leads a campaign to release financial employment into the private sector, in the faith that it is $700,000 for accommodation.
Since yar 2009, only one of the three film companies, Le Parallelle, continues to distribute movies for eXcentris.
The purpose of future purchasers is to reopen all three rooms on 27 February of the next year and to avoid the most beautiful movie Xavier Beauvois Man and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remember Le Devoir, and so he ignores, he thinks with his group of proposals for reduction that are done to him.
He's raised up to Canadian as a whole...
The new American diplomatic branches known by WikiLeaks discover what the United States consider as a complex minority of Canadians against the Americans, but thus express their feeling of supernaturality in the last named Canada.
The American diplomates therefore wonder that every Canadian elector is on the heart of the Canadian-American relations when it is going to vote, and that the visit to President Obama has helped the government to be kept in 2009!
Four new reports among which the American ambassador was in Ottawa and Washington, published yesterday on the public department, provide more sensitive details to get "under the skin".
The notice with date of 22 September 2008, i.e. the election campaign, detailedly indicates the point in which the United States are not part of the taxes discussed by political leaders.
To the great wonder of the American magician in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides for a few explanations.
"Canada's complex of minority, even increasingly, refers to possible political leaders to talking about internal efforts, rather than to realize that these options are related to the United States (as in the campaign on free trade in 1988). "
"The United States are therefore," he concluded, "a promising slone in these options: everywhere present, but potentially too dangerous than to talk about them."
This "reporting silence" understands less than that both countries maintain the intensity of political and economic relations.
"It's logical that the ability of the candidate, the parties or even better the boss of the party to conduct these important relations should be the key factor that has the electors to think when they go to the elections."
Other expressions of this feeling of importance can be read in the report he sent on 22 January 2009 Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for its first visit to Ottawy.
"Your road will help to enhance the maintenance of the government by voting on the confidence at the beginning of February, regarding the federal budget, which Canada is publicly recognizing its first deficit for more than ten years, due to the plan of renewal at $30 to $40 billion," says Mr Breese.
There is no amendment that the Government had to separate Parliament's pre-national meeting so that it could not be affected by the coalition and that the opposition parties mentioned their survival by the quality of the proposed renewal plan.
Other reports from January 2008 and signed by Wilkins, Washington warns the more negative image that is the dramatic series sent to the CBC to the United States.
Velvyslanic is concerned by sending Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not too fatal references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or to income for violent hearings in .
Another report refers to the fact that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe is ready to adopt some of Guantánams.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but based on the principle of the case.
At the end of the meeting, it is written here, "sends a paper about Omara Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Phoenix Muslim, a State Secret."
"The secrets accepted that the directory is revising."
Let's finally know that the persons who are related to WikiLeaks are going to go.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, announced on CBC waves that the person responsible for this mass should be "devastated".
It was reported and he heard of it, too, Mike Huckabee in the United States.
World Plan for the Resume of Lights
The United Nations yesterday had a plan for the renewal of domestic lighting, the lighting of trade and industrial space in 100 countries to achieve the limitation of the lighting effect (GES), which is at least one third of the further restrictions to target the climate stability of the planet from now to 2020.
This ambitional plan is located in the stage of large specific projects that the United Nations wants to carry out in Cancún to compensate the abstention of difficultly implementable commitments to reducing the priority of developing countries.
According to the yesterday proposed plan, if we are replaced by fluokompakt or, even better, with electrical diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the primary quantity of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES on the planet that appeared for lighting would be deteriorated.
Light is responsible for 8% of the world.
It's the equivalent of 70% from the car park on the whole planet.
In Codany, in the year of Lonne, large countries with a significant share in the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, participated in voluntary reduction plans that should enable global GES reductions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But there will be more than 5 Gt out of this balance to achieve the combustion of climate stabilization by 2020 to 2 degrees Celsia in order to make it clear that it will not be done out of control.
95% of energy is spread in the form of heat and residue, i.e. 5%, is a light product.
With fluocompakt fires, the energy need is reduced by 75% and with new deals with Del, we reduce this need two times again.
Fluocompakt fires shall be held in a meaning of 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new pieces with Del,takes that have introduced this week to Philips - this company has given up the United Nations study - , having a predicted life of 25,000 hours and have 80% less energy than the disturbed hole, which gives us an idea of the possible sustainment of the refund plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new wheels can also work with reostats and produce less warmness.
And they don't contain any mouth.
Several experts have expressed refunds against fluokompakt wheels because they include the mouth and they must be classified as a dangerous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries if the producers would create collections.
In addition, as the report states, the main source of growth on the planet is not a fluokompakt fire, but more heat corn electricity that allows many plants to produce electricity mixed in fired fires.
Only in the United States, these centres give up 25,000 tonnes per year.
The report also detailedly states the profits of each country from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would protect a billion dollars annually for electricity purchasing and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is 3.5 warm electricity building 2.5 billion
The slonovin coasts are not patiently expecting the results of electoral results.
The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, requested immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in the Slovenian Coast after the expiration of the specified periods.
"The Secretary-General emphasises the need to complete its work and subsequently announce the preliminary outcome, underlined by the Officer of the United Nations speaker."
"Requests all parties in the Slovenia and the institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to keep any initiatives until the report of provisional results."
Despite the pressures developed by some insurance governments, the electoral committee was allowed to take place the worst date - the middle-night - without publishing the results, three days after Sunday breakfast.
Nearly forty minutes before the date was expired, the President CEI on TV confirmed that the Commission was "continuing working" to be able to report the challenges.
In the middle of the world , the challenges were multiplied , for the CEI to finally announce the name of the second road winning, between Laurent Gbagbo and the member of Alasan Ouattar's opposition.
But the Gbagbo camp is to cancel the Constitutional Board for "duewater" voting north, managed by former rebels of the New Army (FN) from an insufficient state conversion in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Slovenia, confirmed that the manages of fearing the electors practiced by the United Nations (New Army) north of the country, were deployed by the president of the Slovenian branches from going to vote.
The options could be cancelled if the Constitutional Board observed the staff that Gbagbo has given.
Of course, the opposite to President Gbagbo is that the highest court of the country is not neutral because Paul Yao N'Dree, a very close political partner of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north, demending any connection to the former rebellious, condemned the detention in the announcement of outcomes as "inacceptable" and requested Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far that he would have won.
His associates confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of outcomes because he knows that he has suffered loss and that to give complaint to the Constitutional Board after he has prohibited the election committee to submit the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, running on Sunday, was considered a crowning of the process of reconciliation and reconciliation of the country, which has already been divided into two half years.
The United Nations warned in the Mediterranean Political Fraction of the Slovenian Bridge that it could be made responsible for the case of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round, 31 October, as a victory of 38% of votes over 32% for Alassan Ouattar, who received public support by former President Henri Konan Bedia (25% in the first round).
The unemployment measure remains stabil in the third quarter of France.
The unemployment measure in France in the meaning of the International Work Agency (BIT) remained stabil to 9.3% in the metropolitical France (9.7% in the maritime area), as indicated by the provisional data on the correction of the sessional derogations (CVS), published on Thursday in INSEE.
The beginning of the unemployed was 2,631 million in metropolis.
The data from the second quarter were confirmed by 9.3% of the active population in metropolis and 9.7% of the sea.
The unemployment measure shall be increased by 0.1 point for one year.
In a larger conclusion, 3.4 million people in metropolitical France are not working in the third quarter, but they would like to work, regardless of whether they are available for two weeks to work and whether they are looking for or not.
The situation of current young people on the labour market was still increasing the employment rate at 24.2% in the metropolitical France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points per year) and 25% in the maritime area.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people were in the meaning of the International Agency of Work without work from 15 to 24.
It is about elders, those mentioned in the metropolitical France a small increase in unemployment to 6.4% in metropolit France (+0.2 points in three months, as in the year), that is 482 000 people from 50 years old and 6.6% in the sea.
Only the population in 25-49 years of age was the benefit of unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolit France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points per year) and 8.8% in all France.
Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment rates since 2006, and it is after half of its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to work monthly and reported on Wednesday 9,8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and invoked
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the directors of waste processing and PS PS Governing Council Bouches-du-Rhône was accused and imprisoned in the street in Luynes, nearby Aix-en-Provence, in the investigation of public prohibitions, seemingly underly obtained.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of disuse of the company's property, public funds and public property, hiding, payment, receiving taxes for the effects of the office and shooting, indicates his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is warrior and continues to explain to the judge all the questions that he will ask, and not any of the overwhelming."
"It's easy to follow her because of many crimes, but another thing is to prove them," she declared for AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before listening to her client.
Mr. Guérini said by his lawyers that he sent the judges before his hearing a short notification to explain everything.
One of his neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and imprisoned in the middle of the evening.
According to his lawyer, Lucie Simona, his client never did anything else than to ensure the operation of the ships that he had to manage.
It is about the allocation of a prohibition or the destination of funds associated with their functioning, he never knew anything like that, Mr Simon said.
In this regard, Daniel Pinn, the former General Director of the Services of Aubagne, was charged in the middle of the misuse of public guards and complots, and allowed the freedom, under the judicial supervision of the prohibition of contact with the protagonists of all matters.
"My client has been able to make an explanation to all the hosts he has been exhausted."
"The investigative judge will watch and leave it in freedom," his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Other four persons were accused and released to freedom on the night from Tuesday to the middle, while they were under court oversight due to two of them, he introduced the representative of the State State Michael Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, representative of the Director-General with the Elegancy of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is empowered to accept taxes for the effect of the office and for the passion of corruption."
Two aglomerators from Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringier, are accused, one for "decision and disuse of the company's property", the other for "complot in the disuse of public guards".
Finally, the trade partner Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "hispering the misuse of the company's property".
Among those who have been confronted with Mr. Guérinim, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been accused of concurrence in the case of subhydrated public prohibitions relating to Korsica.
Researchers are suspicious of his company's helping money from a large gangstership.
The investigation shall be conducted in the context of several opened court investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters relating to the prospects of closing public prohibitions, in particular in the matter of waste.
From the source of close investigation, watching is focused, especially on the submins of allocation and functioning of the stock in La Ciotat, which breaks waste from Aubagne, as from some cities from the town of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: Elysian palace overcome Syria's mediation
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotilda Reiss, a young research office arrested in Iran for "spinage", simplified opinions in France, introduced diplomacy to war preparation and highlighted the relations between Paris and Teheran.
All of this has been stuckly followed by the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and with Le Monde reveal some of the results of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained his strategy to the Americans, while he went so far that he gave them the advice to control such cases in Iran (small group of exhibitors).
They indicate how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of young French was not a complaint against the release of freedom for the freedom of Kakavanda, the Iraker in France and the United States Justice for the underlying trade with material in the benefits of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they detail the light of the way the French presidentship tried to manipulate media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the release of Klotilda Reiss.
He didn't do anything for it at the Vatican.
The diplomatic telegram signed on August 12 2009 in Paris has a title: "Iran:France comments for the solution in the case of handicap".
The Adviser from the Elysian Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richer, delivered by Director Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Central East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the representative of the American diplomacy of Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They recommend the Americans to do so much to be brought back to their own national members by the violence detained in Iran.
"Give a sound," they say, "continue expressing "in the media the words "based human rights", "inviolence", "immediate release".
It is necessary to bring into the hatred of the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it more than what more they will ask you to stop."
Because trying to negotiate discrete channels, "it will not resolve anything quietly," Ireland's "mistress for avoiding maneuvres".
Mr. Richier says that the attack of foreigners is "Iranian family tactic: reading the hands for the "political exhibition".
It notes that the release of Klotildy Reiss (which will occur on 16 August, on the day when the French ambassador is presented) "requests the payment of high financial amounts to the Irish" (cauce 230 000 euros).
And he'll announce that the Elysian palace anticipates the cases of handy, the phenomenon that "will be thrown."
The Iranians could "in the future arrest about 1800 French living in Iran", says.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left the licence 12 days ago, but she remains blocked in Iran.
Information is extended: Iranian Kaukavand, of which the United States declare that it has been issued for illegal trade with electronic material sensitive in relation to Iran, is released in Paris on freedom based on the decision of the judge.
As many observers, the American Majesty asks for this anxious meeting.
For Washington, which tracks the illegal Iranian network to obtain the material designed for the nuclear program, is the spread of Khakavanda is a bad news.
France has come to the meeting?
Freedom of Ireland for freedom of young French?
In the next conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richer assures that it is not.
The Elysian palace, as it states, was not only "insomnised by this decision of the judge", but seeked the opportunity to stand against it.
"The discussions have been held between the Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "The French Government cannot change the decision of the court," comments.
Mr. Richer also wants to demonstrate that the Kakavand is under the "limited" supervision of the French reporting service.
The Council of the Palace of Elysia is enlarging the phone number, enlarging the phone listener, and then informing the American diplomatic that Iraq is currently in Paris's buildings managed by Iran's welfare."
At the time of Klotilda Reiss in Iran, the Elysian palace develops effort, negotiates, by means of communications and organized "unicians" in the media to convince that the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays "significant" and "effective" role of "mediator".
Americans note this activity without ironing and find that manipulation brings its fruit, since several articles in print reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evolves the media "blest" of French official factors.
On what the "gratitude", expressed against Mr. Assad, is questioned by the prominence of Paris.
"And through their declaration, the French officials in private recognize that they have only a weighty idea of what the Syrians have done."
The document is then concerned with the d·e·a's proposed by the Elyse Palace to pay in this fixe.
Intensity of communication "which aims to validate the policy of President Sarkozy's opening up to Syria", it analyses.
It was applied in 2008, "that was observed by many critical votes in France and in the opening and labelled as a preliminary and unservible."
The "some overcome the Syrian role", Paris tries to "demonstrate Syria, which slaves can serve when playing a role in ̈a".
The goal is also "the zero of unfairness between Syria and Iran".
The American ambassador knows it with a very good source.
On August 11, François Richer said to him, "We don't know whether the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is"
"But we thanked them yet."
"It should be at least to introduce fraud and uncleanness between Iraq."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy takes her in the Elysian palace.
In the communication, he thanks to the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the benefit of our country's release".
End on-line her after midnight for young Korea
The South Korean Government will accept the Law called "Pecival", which will prohibit adolescents to play online games after north, blocking access to them, introducing responsible government factors.
On the law it will be submitted to the Parliament in a position to ask for online games to block access to these games after midnight to younger than 16 years, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Family Ministry.
"Multium kids play these games all night and then have problems with school learning and are not able to live normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," he declared for AFP Jo Rin, the leader of the Ministry, which has a law on concern.
Online games will be new accessible from 6 hours.
The communities will have one year to prepare for the law.
The Government also assumes that it requires the company to limit the daily access to these games for young people whose parents ask for this.
It also provides free programs for people who ask for it to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "populated" countries and the daily print brings regularly different facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The Earth is equally an improper master in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea obtained four gold medails on World Cyber Games, which faces 58 other nations.
World Mistership in 2018-2022: Fifa establishes host countries.
The full distress for the suspicion of corruption establishes the Fifa executive committee on Thursday of the World Country Country in 2018 and 2022, highly motivated politically, where the fight against influence and lobbing risks that the technical criteria are preceding.
It is more certain that the king's competition of Fifa in 2018 will take place in Europe , the traditional garden of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgia).
Mystery in 2022 will be much more exotic, while the International Federation hopes that it will be able to obtain a new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the Premier of African continent in 2010, or to continue in the United States or in the Prolonged East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons involved in the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Princes from Katar, Governing Factories and Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The negotiation in the cluster leads to the risk that they will take up until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to set hierarchy according to candidates.
According to the evaluation report Fifa, the documentation of English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and the American (2022) includes the best arguments, as the documentation of their competitors.
However, these issues will have too large weight for 22 members of the Executive Commission at the hour for voting.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the discovery, leading to suspend two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Themeria et Amos Adam) may have destroyed the chance of its country, the buried coffee, which had yet a world champion only once in the year.
The BBC sent the crown on Monday, when she sent a document that "scapped on a spending" three influenced members of the EC (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayato.
How to do Fifa unfriendly and bring Ethiopian leaders to hatred with David Cameron first.
The President of the Government hopes that he will be able to repeat the one that his preachers told to Tony Blair, which was able to obtain in 2005 for London the Olympical Her Organization in 2012.
Should this intensity be sufficient for England to add a new league to its name to the EC (European Commission?)?
There is nothing less fair because two Spain-Portugal don't miss the tromps of already prepared stations, its welcome (World Shampionat in 1982 in Spain, Olympical Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their ball culture.
But the cloud economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitional cold powder.
Equipmental measures against the Englishmen and doubts on the payability of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia’s position, which was the outside of its documentation throughout its areas (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But the President of the Government Vladimir Poutin decided that the mastership would not move to Curich and publicly declare "a little competition in the preparation of voting", in the words, only the claims that were progressed to accuse English pressure against the members of the CE (European Commission).
"We'll put them in a floor, we'll try to compromise them," Mr. Poutin said.
For 2022, they appear to be a logical favorite of the United States with their significant experiences from 1994.
The highest economy in the world, the seat of Fifa's main sponsors, seems that this country has a big step towards Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have prepared a beautiful project.
But these candidatures seem to be preliminary for both countries that have made a "test" together in 2002.
Next threat: Awarding the monster of the world 2026 to China, which is horizonally desired by Fifa, has made Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Katar, who came out of the hands of a big ease in the form of future stadiums, and in Australia, Fifa would continue in its expansion to new countries, but these two countries represent more risks than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could be able to pay for chatting television payments (with time movement) payable to European countries, creating a mistake force for Fifa.
Second mandate: transparency (histority)
The Gaulle was really wrapped.
Mitterrand wake up the view that he weighs.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not bear in the least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than they.
The mandate to the Elysian palace calls someone else.
The current head of the State will therefore be candidate in 2012.
But obviously, it is not in a good agreement with the participation of the secrets associated with the President.
So it is necessary to do as if doubts continue to survive.
In the same way and in the other way.
In 2006, unless he wanted to believe that, friends of Jacques Chiraca made a claim that the third mandate would not be discharged.
On November 15, with a serious expression of Nicolas Sarkozy, he assured that "this will be decided at times on the submarine of 2011".
As the UMP members of the Parliament in the middle of the evening in the Elysian palace, the "two mandates" perspective has sent a little warm state.
Was that an official announcement of his candidature?
He wasn't far away from that.
The President only reminded that the adjustment of the Constitution in 2008 limited the amount of five-year-old periods to two.
It was only a notice, not a notice.
It's not the first time it's held at such meetings by a humor tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you have seven and a half years with me," he spent in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: "You don't think I'm not thinking about another stage."
His previous announcement will not make it as a candidate more than the last day; he will not make it as a candidate or less.
If he calls a comment, it's due to two truths.
At the way to the candidate to the PS, on the one side.
But this isn't the entrance of Segolèna Royal's cow, which presses Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
It is, however, because his candidature in 2012 is evident that many in PS want to organize the fighting buildings more early than the thoughts.
Bad investigation on the other side.
First, the rights electors would prefer Françoise Phillona's candidate from Nicolas Sarkozy's candidate (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we don't investigate that thing with UMP," replied immediately and looked at people from the nearest round of the government.
"If there's no chance of an injury, there's a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin reports.
"They will still believe that he can win," Alain Juppé, equipped with clearness.
Euro: The Central European Bank is forced to continue in its purchases of state titles.
The final meeting of the Central Council for the year should be the opportunity to determine the outcome of the crisis or, at least, the notification of the stoping of a large number of unnecessary monetary policy operations which must be completed until the end of this year.
The crisis of the above European views is committed to an institution for the delivery of value papers without doubt that it is possible to be so category-categoric under a threat of deterioration today, which is already so busy on European markets with precious papers.
The political price would be higher than that.
The French Ministry of Finance of Christine Lagarde has yesterday given an active role that the Central European Bank plays in the progress of the crisis of European States' views.
She didn't want to say if she thought that the bank could do more, for example by increased their purchase programme of obligations.
"I welcome my view of my European partners..."
On the evening before, in Brussels, when the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament hears, the President of the Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more explicit in relation to its purposes, and he agreed with the fact that the programme of purchase of state titles on the secondary market "continues" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting that is held on Thursday.
Only certainty: The Central European Bank will keep its basic unchanged rates of 1%, its historical lowest level since May 2009.
In terms of the purchasing of the obligations of the deposit of the Central European Bank have been doubled by EUR 1.35 billion last week.
And thanks to the inconscience of the market agreements, the new purchases of Irish and Portuguese obligations yesterday.
The total central banks of the euro have purchased 67 billion euros since May 2010.
There are no doubts between the market anticipation agreements (see page 29).
Even the economics don't expect any significant change in the course.
If the loan operations for more than three months have been lost from the Central Bank's arsenal, this finally designated bank shall access to the unlimited delivery of liquids according to large-scale submissions and for a period of duration from one week to three months.
The economics today expect this mechanism to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that she would change her program in significant way."
"If not, this would mean to take the risk of a short new pressure," says Michael Schubert, the Commerzbank economy.
"The progress of the east announced during the first Thursday 2011 seems likely more likely," Norbert Brams, the economy in Sal.
Uppenheim.
"The European Central Bank should keep the volume of the purchase of its obligations to survive a weak market," adds Norbert Brams.
In view of the exposure of the European banks on the markets, the debt in the euro has nothing to choose but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It is necessary for each price to replace the lack of investors on the market and to act in such a way to prevent the planning of the payable performances of the states belonging to the most crucial part of the market," confirmed the significant obligation manager yesterday.
Since if the rates arise, they will suffer more to reduce their duty rather than to stabilize it.
It's a salvation of the euro for this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi back
After the beginning of a week for Italy, she was a little released by the return to 10 years of obligatory rates.
Return to temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economics of the Regions, the presidents said that they heard Giulia Tremonti's comments as "unresoluble" and expected "unpredictable" weekend, which then participated in dementoval.
In any case, on Wednesday, a derogation from the long German rates reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of contracts against the risk of bankrotation (CDS) led to 263 points, which caused certain distortions in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi noted that the derogation with German rates was over 400 basic points in Spain.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said about himself that he was "too busy" "too busy" by "building market development" and my order by Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad report is that it is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, the economy of the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the absency of growth and unexpected fiscal income, which is in hands and puts it on the risk that it cannot cover its needs of financing.
The last predicts of Brussels were a cold puzzle for the government.
The Italian growth is expected from now on 1,1% in 2011 and on 1,4% in 2012... while calculating that the Senate is available to its analysis, 1.3% and 2%.
For these submissions, calculating the European Commission, the deficit of public funds will also represent 4.3% of the gross domestic product in the next year (contrast with 3.9% of the proposed government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
A new summary of additions to the state budget that could be established after the holidays at EUR 7 billion.
"When necessary, new serious measures will have to be taken," appreciates the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, O日 Rehn.
For this moment, Italy accepts support for international institutions.
"The basic stones of her economy are all right and its calculations are right, we repeat it already," assures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian Governing Council of the International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short or low, because through its significant debt (119.2% of the gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the efforts to stabilize the requested in Italy are less than the effort required from the rest countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, the main OCDE economy.
The issue of political instability remains.
14. Silvio Berlusconi will take the lead to the statement of the uncertainty of the Missionary, and then they may be able to organize the elections to which it is calculated at the end of March.
It would start such a period, as is not appropriate for decisions in the case of serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anticrisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde again stressed it last night in the printing of Paris: "I think the Europeans have demonstrated this on Sunday all day and night, they are obviously very solid decisions, engaging to defend their currency and their monetary zone."
Although all the related, yesterday-mentioned expansions relating to European State obligations have brought water to government monkeys and Central Europe.
But we can't talk about the start of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's notice office noted that it could degrade the debt record of Portugal, the objectives for which the most different speculations are affected.
"Because in May, a real policy is insufficiently transparent and clear, particularly based on banking systems," states the Economy Exane BNP Paris.
Moreover, "the political time runs less than the time of the market."
In the knowledge of this interrupted relationship and danger that hides, the European countries intensify debates aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
The informal coincidence between the Ministry of Finance, most affected by the problem, and in larger terms with their G20 opponents, is very well developed.
In view of the Euroscope (Eurogroup) meetings and the Ecofin group from the beginning of the next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is held today.
The programme has the sentence of non-conventional measures to support the euro country with market concentration (see above).
This is the European Finance Fund (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, invoked on Wednesday in Singapore to Asia to inform investments from the East of Europe on the development of crisis.
It is not the objective of this way to increase the funds, it is preparing its impact on the earth to achieve this objective.
The valuable papers of the FESF shall be assumed for the next month.
Yesterday, the American official representative informed the Agency Re日s that the United States would support the eventual increase in mobilised financial architectures by added direct engagement in the FMI.
The lands in the first range, Portugal and Spain, are prepared to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms which are attached to close measures to the ≥ actor.
Lissabon and Madrid other way than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid any price to ask for international assistance before they apply their own budget correctives and to decide on structural reforms necessary to restore their trust.
The capitalists in the European Funds finally talk about the generals for the process of normalization of markets with the binding obligations.
On its road to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came with a idea whether there would be 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not weigh to re-cover the resource of value papers.
Economys from Barclays Capital, which is the actor of the first trade plan with European supplies, judge that the appendix of approximately 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "ra" is the form of a direct provision of financial liquidity.
The average exists: it is the European financial stability mechanism, which has been awarded by 60 billion euros on this day.
The Council, which has all the opportunities to be tested in European main cities.
Especially when market submissions were worse.
Snow and findings: 24 countries have an oral ability.
The snow assignments will still be moved in the transport, especially on the roads of other classs in Britain, and there is a risk that some economic activities are disrupted.
Twenty-four periods have the current oral capacity for the risk of snow and consequences.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, have been connected to 20 periods that have already been published by the oranshood, 18 from middle afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, after night.
According to Météo France, snows are significantly affecting problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes and weaknesses in Ile-de-France.
The snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the periods concerned and is covered from 1 to 3 cm, places to 5 in the Paris region.
Periods of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and periods of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snows are enough to cause moves in the transport and break some economic activities, predices Météo France.
At the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some periods have prohibited to travel hard cost transport - cost cars over 7,5 tonnes with Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brie-Loudéac.
The road operation on the roadways of other classs in Britain is very difficult, and the police recommends to go out with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been canceled for this day.
In Pikardia, school connections were prohibited on Thursday.
In the middle of the evening, no special measures are presented to restrict cost transport.
The Periodic Authority "invites all car drivers to the highest care of the streets and to adapt the driver's weight."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested the aircraft company to cancel 25% of their flights on the Paris Airport Roissy on Thursday and 10% on Orly from the expected snowstorms.
The DGAC recommends a traveller using air transport services to connect to its company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick airports are closed to the quarter of the quarter in South London and airports in Edinburgh in Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: first finance after
Since the debate on the modernization of transport to Ile-de-France is in full run, a billion.
At least during the debate.
In particular, we have 23 billion billion at Grand Paris metro, which is to establish Société du Grand Paris.
In order to enable this building to be launched, he announced the State of a grant of EUR 4 billion.
It is just theoretically the amount that will allow SGP to use for the prohibition of a share of financing from its double resource.
We finally get to the first places today.
The 2010 Financial Rectification Act, which examines the Financial Committee of the National Research today, includes mechanisms set out to ensure this.
There are two: creation of special taxes from equipment and increased taxes from the office at Ile-de-France.
In the text of the law, article 15, it sounds "in the benefits of the public institution of the Societé du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The rent of this rate is 117 million euros per year."
The second is the reconstruction of taxes for offices already existing, therefore "to be modernized to increase the result of it and to increase the touch of Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take out?
Too crazy.
It's not digited in the text.
We've got 4 billion away.
"There is claimed that these fiscal resources are connected to 4 billion euros from the investment that will be mobilised by the State and are inserted into the Société du Grand Paris under the project," we can read in the interpretation of the debt.
This system doesn't seem shocking in us in the SGP company.
"From the time we have created incomes (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the study for three years and then shoot up to 4 billion, it's explained here."
"It will be put into the budget and used for the need."
The SGP has the fact that 4 billion will be assigned to 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which 4 billion promised are still inappropriate abonics, risks that it is sometimes a disappointed parliamentary debate.
At the public meeting, the 7th meeting will be.
Smoking hackers and accompanied publishers
The case of WikiLeaks has two significances.
On the one hand, an apparent scandal, a scandal, which seems to be a scandal only faced in the face of a decreativity that leads to relations between States, citizens and prints.
On the other hand, it refers to deep changes at international level and takes the future of the controlled return.
But let's do a schedule.
With regard to the aspect of WikiLeaks, it is confirming that each document consists of a secret service (whoever is a nation) consists exclusively of printing boxes.
The Americans of the way of Berlusconi's sexual life are told what everyone could read in any news (all other than these two Berlusconi's own) and the carrier profile of Kadafi was already read for the cabarot artist for the scenes.
The rule to which the secret documents can be collected only from the already known reports is essential in the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go into a bookbuilding that is ezoteric literature, you will see that each work is repeated (of Graal, mystery Rennes-le-Château, Templates or Zionaries) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And not only because the author of ocult texts doesn't like to follow new information (or he does not know where to find messages about non-existent) but because those who are observing ocultism are only what they already do and what confirms what they have learned before.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informator is lined, and the line (or the spirit) leader of secret services (and if not, he could, as I know, be a editor in the Libération newspapers), which constitutes the truth only what he admits himself.
The information on Berlusconim, sent by the American prominence to the state resort, was the same as Newsweek published a week ago.
Why, then, was the discovery of these documents so increasing?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, and even though the excellence, at least since the end of the second world war and since the time when the heads of the States can phone or fly on a joint dinner, have lost their diplomaticity and, except a few small exercises in representation, they have been transformed into the Spanish center.
Anyone who follows the research movies knows very well that only from licodirectity it seems to be ignored.
However, it repeat publicly, anonymous obligation to decrease, and brings it a bad light to the American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can get the most accurate information made by the most powerful country of the world represents a strong, unless it is impossible, for the prestigiation of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and his winners.
But let's go from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Sometimes, in Orwell's days, it was my mind to take all power, like a Big Brother, who controlled every movement of his people.
The Orvellov prophecy has been demonstrated since the opportunity to control every movement through the phone, every transaction, visited hotel, using the distance and so further, became citizens of the full sacrifice of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now that even "grooms" with the most secret information of the powerful can't deal with the hacker's injury, it's not going to be a control report directly and it's become a prosecutor.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - chosen as a citizen - can know all secrets of power.
How can it be able to keep power that has no longer the possibility to keep his own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the true secret is an absolute secret (and the absolute secret can never be discovered); it is also true that all information about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel is a secret inconsistent secret because it is extracted from public life; but to discover, as WikiLeaks did, that the secret of Hillary Clinton's was unintentional secrets, means to deny all power to him.
WikiLeaks did not make any mistake in Sarkozy or Merkel, but did something big to Clinton and Obam.
What results of the successful power will be so important?
It is obvious that in the future States they will be able to send on-line sensitive information - that would be equal to its publication on a placate that is blown on the round of the street.
But it is also obvious that it is unrequired to hope that it is possible to keep a message on the phone.
It's nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of the State traveled to the aircraft and connected to some of its colleagues.
How will it be able to be kept in the future in the promotion of private and sensitive messages?
I know that for this moment, the predict belongs to science-fiction, and then it's fantastic, but I have to imagine the governmental factors who are discretely carrying out the formality on non-controlable paths and brings only the reports that can remember or hide more rare information in the bottom.
The information will be stored in unique copies in keys closed: totally taken, the attempt to spying in Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that it now moves the side forward, that means a delay.
One centurie after the free telegraph signed revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated the telegraph based on roads (telephones).
Video cases (analogs) have enabled them to film the movie step after steps, to move it forward and up, and to discover all the secrets of the mount, while now CDs (numbers) are only allowed to go through the movies, it means after portions.
We're coming from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the road and transport, which includes three and half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that policy and communication technology return to the cars of the horse.
Last note.
On the other hand, the print tried to understand what was based on the secret of the promiscuity.
Now they're the gentlemen who ask for confidential information from printing.
Climate: how France hacked its promises on financing
The year after the Codec Agreement is time to test the compliance of the promises on the deblocated financing (subsequently financed with the start (fast start) or preliminary), carried out by developed countries.
And the large French hacks were discovered.
In the Codean Agreement, developing countries were committed to pay 30 billion dollars in 2010-2012.
The European Union promised 7.2 billion euros for three years and France 1.26 billion euros (420 billion per year).
At the beginning of the COP16 EU, it was very important to convince her partners that she was committed to financing fast start: a report that explains the actions of its Member States, pressure, large side events, distribution of the brochure...
Transparency operations are unvaluable and evaluated at their value: developed countries and civil society would like to make all developed countries and civil society the same and with the same measure of accuracy.
The EU notifies that in 2010 she released 2,2 billion euros, which leads it to the right way to comply with its promise of 7,2 billion in 2012.
But if we make details, we find out that things are much more complicated.
These financial provisions are "new and additional" according to the Codec Agreement to ensure that the increased burden has been carried out without the capture of Public Aid for Development.
Unfortunately, there is no match in what it means "new and additional".
While the European Commission did not harmonize, some Member States, among others and France, have locked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that makes him the best.
For example, the European Commission considered a reference in 2009: international financing has been maintained and is still added to 150 million for three years of fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references to annual payment terms or terms at the level of public aid for development.
Furthermore, France believes that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
Otherwise, there is no reference to the expenses of the previous period or to the global level of public assistance for the development of the Aideque au development.
In particular, France’s total support to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decreased) must comply with its commitment on the financing of new and additional...
Another decision-making element is dividing in gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet and everyone chooses its own way of calculation.
Some, such as France, believe that 1 bill is equal to 1 bill.
It is evidently hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of the loans can be added to certain investments that are rental (frequently related to projects associated with decreasing, delays in more income) it is to present one euro that we get as equivalent to one euro we give... they should not understand it from the title of their obligations but as the price of the loans for the trust country (e.g. the equivalent of the rates).
However, France can only give such a derogation: "He keeps" its obligation to 420 million euros, which does 91.5% of the loans (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of the gifts (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country of the Union that uses the loan in such a way.
Germany requested 46% from here, while Denmark, Netherlands or Slovenia (in other cases) complied with their commitments with 100% of gifts.
Otherwise, when the totality of the European Union gives 1 euro on the content of its promise, France only gives 10 centimeters and considers this effort comparable.
That's a nice keeklir cow!
For survey, France operates with two leaderships in its financing: on the one hand with the development of action in time and on the other hand with real financial burden.
Although it is only issued by 36.1 million euros, it can be convinced that it issues 420 million euros "new and additional" in relation to its promises.
Manipulation of the Minister for Finance (for it seems to be Bercy who made such a decision) could have two negative impacts, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to pay only?) and in the negotiation because the developing countries are not completely...
The capital of pre-financing is only a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to the series of climate discussions.
But she could be a screening sand, more in a huge machine, which is UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to learn from this first year of pre-financing.
First, France should notify the change in its way of leading an annual evidence for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations, compliance and justice against the final countries of the European Union.
But in particular, France should predict the discussion on contributions to financing (other main sales currently discussed): we should not address "additionality" or how to pay loans.
France should change its position in order to become as progressive in these contributions as in the last.
So everyone puts it into the new Ministry for Life Affairs, Mrs. Kosciusko-Moriset, which comes to Cancuna next week.
A surprising notice of the fast start of France and its view of "additionality" and the use of loans could result in increased international confidence, necessary to continue in discussions.
Alarms about pesticides that children will start.
The 10-year-old child will late on one day of 81 different chemicals, according to one study published in this centre, from the Building Generation Association (ex-Movement for Rights and Keeping of the Future Generation).
Associations, which note that its outcomes "require significant statistical value in view of the low level of samples analysed, but are characteristics for the processed problem," bought between July and the food sample currently consumed in four feeds and one easy food as a light feed for a child, about ten years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five cups of fresh fruit and greenine, three milk products and 1,5 litres of water daily - as sugars, were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, hard stones and other contaminating factors.
The balance of the taliers is decreasing: 81 chemicals, 42 are classified between carcinogenic, possibly or probably, and five substances belong to the carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that may be used as a disturbance for internal mixture (PE), according to the study of a number of institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although, in all cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance that is accepted are not separately exceeded, in our research we well see that the reality in the exposure of consumers with contaminant substances, maybe cancerogenic, and/or injury," states the association.
For dinners of oil and tea with milk, there are about 10 residues with potential carcinogenic and three shown as certain cancer genetics, just as it is in about 20 residues that could cause hormonal systems.
The jabble, introduced from Brazil, quoted as a small bowl, contains the tracks of six chemicals, other than in France, prohibited fungicide.
The same applies to green fascicles from Kenya included for dinner, in which the study has shown the rates of strong insecticides prohibited in the EU.
Furthermore, the bubbles of milk meat, the tunnel in the powder, and even the bowl and the powder were sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water of the couch analysis, the presence of dushnans and chloroforms discovered.
Steak from loss to dinner was "the richest" with 34 chemical residues and even the analysis of the plastic talent used to burn food in the microwave tube did not dismiss an analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this "contaminant cocktail" is probably underestimated," results from the study.
The Ecological Europe-Green (EE-LV) community proposed "fair in the face of an important" to establish a moratory for the use of pesticides to stop "the growth of civilization diseases".
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) studied the status of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and green consumed in Europe, from which 76 in cereals.
