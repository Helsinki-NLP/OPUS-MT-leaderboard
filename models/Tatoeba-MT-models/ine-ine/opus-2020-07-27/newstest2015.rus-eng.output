Scientists have found a way to discover family stars
Astrophics at the Californian University in Santa Cruz studied turbulent mixture and its impact on chemical unity in stars.
It is expected that the opening of specialists will allow to look for families among the stars, namely those from one class.
The results of their survey authors in the magazine Nature and can be found at the University site shortly.
The same composition of the composition of nearby stars is a turbulent mixture in the gas clouds before the education of the stars.
Even if a star-born star then leaves a star-classer, it is possible to determine the place of its birth and the area of the education of the stars.
Earlier, the scientists doubted that the evolution of the stars outside the class could lead to a decline in its chemical content.
The results of the astrophysics modeling are that such disasters should not occur.
In its investigation, the supercomputing specialist has made two flows of inter-star gas, which together form the cloud.
This object has been converted into a classic class for several million years under its own gravity.
The scientists added the gas flows at the beginning and found that the rapid turbulent mixture of the cloud reached a high level of unity.
As astrophysicians believe, their study shows that the chemical stars can be searched, as well as the definition of the areas of education of such objects.

Lavrov: Russia will not "sleep the door" in relation to new sanctions and will not go out of the WTO
Russia is not going to "sleep the door" in relation to new sanctions.
This has been stated today by head of MIDI RF Sergei Lawrow, speaking to the students and teachers of MIMO.
With regard to our responsibilities on the case of a new anti-rossian sanction wave, I will not even consider, question, because it must be calculated specifically, said he.
And when we realize what Peace and American partners will like this time, we will decide how to answer it.
This will not be with a kidnapping door, some misunderstood, the Minister underlined.
We will first turn away from our interests, the interests of protecting our economy, our area, our citizens, our business, and make conclusions of partners' partners in respect of their advantage, the compliance and confidence.
Following the steps under the sanctions, it can be very well judged what partners are achieved - the Chapter of MIDI RF continued.
If the whole vote says that "these sanctions will also be sick for us, but we have to go on this to punish Russia," it is probably not very appropriate."
The fact that the WTO's outcome of RF in response to new sanctions is not.
Instead, we want to gain the WTO instruments more actively, including when there is a matter of trade, said Lavrov.
We have already committed this tool to overcome, as we believe, the EU discrimination policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of demping and apply anti-dumping measures against the growth of the RF economy.
"We are ready to work with WTO mechanisms and to stop the position of inappropriateness to apply the EU's third energy package standards strictly," said Lavrov.
How is it proper to use the sick in the design of the garden?
Irena Okuneva answers the questions:
Since it loses its main attractiveness after the flower, it is willing to sit together with others.
It is associated with many cultures.
Along with the grain, it is possible and to be decorative for other periods, as well as the flowers with it.
Another plus sirena is that it provides a mass for creativity.
You can shape it with a different height, a improved coast, a cust with a wide range and even a jardin bonsey - a tree with an amazingly exhausted stone.
Just select the form that matches the design of your garden.

Remembering the very American ideal that work rights are human rights
Congressmen of Kit Ellison and John Lewis proposed a legislative draft to which the trade unions are protected as civil rights.
"Where are the Professionals, there are the Middle Class's slaves", says Ellison, a democracy from Minnesota, who is the Chairman of the Congress of the Progress Fraction.
That is why I am deeply presenting the Act of Enlargement of the Rights of the People's Rights, together with the symbol of the movement for Civil Rights of John Lewis.
This innovative legislative project will provide the same legal opportunities for the discrimination of professional organizations as in other forms of discrimination, remaining forces of professionals
Amendment of the Law on the Ruling of Workers in order to allow those who have discrimination to participate in the organization of professionals, to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damage and tragic payments - a and initiative.
However, this is, of course, not a radical initiative -- at least, in the American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Elison, Lewis and the colleagues of the law project are to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks in the recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country, the Americans have ever supported the countries of the world in taking, expanding and respecting the rights of work.
It was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country protected the democraty, the freedom of words, the freedom of printing and the right to the body.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Duglas and his assistants helped the country to accept the constitution that was established in order to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hideki Too was replaced by democracy.
With full acknowledgement that the employees and their professionals play a role in the form of new Japan, they included the text that directly recognised that "the right of the bodies to the body and to the negotiations and the collective assurance".
When the United States were occupied by Germany after World War II, General Duit David Azenhauer and his assistants helped Germans to write a constitution that guarantees that the Adolf Hitler Fashism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that actors would have to be organized and listened in the new State, Germans included an article that openly stated: "The right to train associations to protect and improve work and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each person and to each profession or activities.
The agreements that make or seek to violate this right will not have the right of power; the measures for these purposes will be recognised against law.
When the former Lady of Eleonar Roswellt was the President of the International Commission on Human Rights, which made a World Declaration on Human Rights, which would be adopted by the Organization of United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Ruswell and the constituents included the guarantee that " each has the right to organize and enter into the promotion of its interests."
The American generations adopted as a basic situation that work rights are human rights.
When this country consults other countries about how to create civil and democracy communities, the Americans explained that the right to the organizations - and that it should be protected as a partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions.
Now that these rights are subject to attacks in America, it is wise to return to the American ideal that the workers should have the right to the body and to hear their voices in a free and open society.
As the pregnant Martin Luther King said fifty years ago:
History is a big teacher.
Now everyone knows that the company's movement did not distort the nation's force, but increased them.
As a result of the live level of millions, the promotions have wonderfully created the industry market and have increased the whole N° to the unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack professionals forget these simple truths, but the story remembers them.
The story remembers how we should.
Official recognition of work rights as human rights - and enhancement of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trades - has been grown a long time.
Kit Ellison and John Lewis regenerate ideals that have historically extended America and made a promise of democracy to reality.
The Judge is temporarily blocking the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
The Federal Court of Justice in the United States on Sunday has temporarily blocked the law of Louisiana, about which his parties say that he will, mostly, close all five abort clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by Governor Louisian Bobby Ginadle in June and had to enter into force on 1 September, the doctors who are aborting would have the power of patients in the hospital in the radius of 30 miles from their affairs.
However, the judge's decision means that the doctors can continue to commit aborts at this time and continue to seek such powers.
"The islanders will be allowed to work fully, continuing to receive powers," wrote Judge John de Grevelz in his decision.
The debate will be appointed for a month in which the judge will make a more continuous decision under this law.
Protectors of the right to abortion have welcomed this decision, in the last way against similar measures, saying that it will give doctors more time to receive hospital powers.
"This further decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from the wrong law, seeking to lose their health and rights," said Nancy Nortap, President and runner of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, which requested the removal of the law from ≥ three of the five national clinics.
It was not obvious whether there would be a decision to doctors from two clinics who did not speak to the leaders and also made a statement on the responsibility of receipt.
Louisiana includes 11 states who have adopted such laws, and the courts have recently recognised such non-constitutional measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the rest of the clinic in this country, were locked by the federal judge on Friday.
Abortion laws, together with the American Acuchers and Genechogs College and the American Medical Association, state that the laws on the right to abort are placed on doctors who are not responsible for medical treatment.
Opponents of aborts express that such measures are addressed to the protection of women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive effect on closing the clinic.
Only one doctor who has aborted in Louisiana has the power of receiving in the hospital, reported the Reproductive Rights Centre.
If all other doctors in the state had to stop executing this procedure, the doctor, fearing its safety, would stop executing this procedure, informed the group.
When criticising this decision, Louisiana's officers said that they would not punish the doctors who are aborting until their statements of authority were waiting for decisions.
What will lead to the introduction of the quota to parental products
At least half of the products on each kind of goods in the asortiment of trade networks must be Russian production, the Deputy of the Hosdames from the Fraction " Justice of Russia" Oleg Nilov.
The parliamentary prepared a draft legislation aimed at introducing protection measures for parental producers, writes the report.
The document will be further detailed to avoid a possible discomfort for buyers.
This is the case of goods that are not produced in Russia.
However, the draft legislative amendments to the article " On the basis of public trade regulation in the RF" provides for amendments to the Tax Code, which determines a decreased rate of NDS by 10 per cent in the implementation of the products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing 50 per cent quota in trade networks includes a package of stimulating measures for Russian producers.
There will be several times more fatherly goods on the carriers.
However, the initiative may have both positive and negative effects, says experts.
According to the company Nalogovik, a member of the independent expert center of the Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy and for the fatherly agricultural and food plants, will have an effect on the nature and will lead to growth.
Moreover, agricultural producers, farmers, small stores will be shown.
They're going to sell more, and that means it's going to grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their conditions and prices to the leaders because they will be required to buy their goods.
The Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than earlier.
This will increase the income of the budget, create new slave places, some adults will begin to expand, somehow faster, and will contribute to the growth of the GDP.
Russia's dependence on foreign advances is decreased in several times, indeed, not in contrast," notes the expert.
The former Russian enterprises could not often try to join stores because of high competition by extraordinary analogues.
Now, after the introduction of the bargo, this weight has been released and can be easily relaxed.
However, it should not be forgotten that after all Russian sanitary checks, commercial products from the countries of Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be carried out.
In other words, there is now a "susting moment" when the former players have gone and the new ones are not yet coming.
After nearly a month, you can talk about the growing question of the fatherly serum and the growing prices for the prepared production," is the race of AIF.ru, the first Vice-President of the Russian Group of Financial Directors of the Russian Group, etc. Tamar Kassianov.
The idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian productive products in each category will allow the sector to be strengthened by producers.
In such cases, they will compete each other, not with goods that have been charged by the subsidy of another State.
In other words, the fight against the purchaser will be spread between companies who work under the single law.
On the other hand, Kazianov notes, Russian producers are able to satisfy 50% of the internal needs of partners far from all the articles.
In this situation, trade networks should be "attracted" from the part of Russian goods to the half of the assortiment.
As a result of this age, there is anxiety of the adjustment of goods.
It may be that in Russia, as produced, insurance products with broken labels will be placed," adds an expert.
Negative effects from the introduction of the quota will feel great trade networks, especially those who will be able to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that foreign providers are also suffering in such a situation, since the question of their production is decreased.
Lithuanianco does not exclude that the quota quota law may also be reflected on consumers.
The fact is that some Russian products can be imported as similars, while the magazines can raise prices on the second, as the deficit.
In the early 2000s, the idea of the import relocation of the economy was repeatedly discussed in February of this year because of the continuing disruption of the rubble.
The question of refusal from import products now becomes even more updated at the back of the west.
The law calls for the binding of the operators in the form of orders to provide for the suppliers to be considered parental producers.
Then we will go much faster and more securely on the road of imports, and the production planning system will be created in a shorter period," says Deputy Oleg Nilov.
A particular quotation mechanism will be for the agricultural sectors, where the potential is particularly high, for example in the milk growth, where the import share was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are actually able to cover a completely covering the rental of Russian magazines.
Moreover, a powerful impulse can also obtain flesh production.
As it is possible, the largest part of imports is maintained in the steel from 30% to 35%.
65-70% are still in Russian production," Casian's opinion.
Experts believe that the introduction of quotas for parental products is advanced by the replacement of imports and may have the process.
However, this initiative will not lead to imports itself, because it requires a comprehensive measure, certain Lithuania.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold by this initiative can still be brought outside the border, which means that the full-valued replacement of imports would not occur, but that means, steps in this direction will be made.
Moreover, there is no need to set out quotas, the production of parental products in the country should be made to carry out these quotas.
The quotas are as soon as these guarantees are provided," states the expert.
Non-temporary diagnosis and absence of access to optimal treatment means that egg cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Joly and her brother James op. Video of their resting mother, who died from the cancer of eggs in 2007.
Women in Australia's rural area are increasingly risked by the cancer of eggs than in the cities.
The analysers of the cart analysis of the diseases of more than 1100 Australian women with the diagnosis of egg cancer in 2005 discovered that only 35 per cent lived five years after diagnosis.
The leading investigations of the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Research reported that the possibility of death in 20 per cent above the people living in regions and remote state areas than those in urban areas.
MINIMUM EXPONDENT: New medicines may cause cancer of eggs and cancer
The researchers followed women's medical way in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of egg cancer, the presence of current diseases and the socioeconomic status also affected the possibility of survival.
Women of age and those who had cancer at a late stage at diagnosis diagnosis were the lowest coefficients of survival.
For those who lived in regions or remote state areas, the probability of death during the investigation was 20 per cent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although an investigation was not intended to determine why women in the middle of cities are more likely to die from the cancer of eggs, Dr. Jordan suggested that non-temporary diagnosis and the absence of access to optimal treatment were factors.
"This disease is best treated by chirurgs specialising the geneological oncology, and they are mainly in large cities," she said.
Despite increasing the quality of telemedicin services to reduce the impact of the distance, she suggested that the increase in the number of outcome services that would allow specialists to treat women closer to home, and the support programmes for people who are walking away from home could be helped.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of the geographical position, an investigation showed that the long-term life between women with egg cancer was rarely highlighting the need for more effective treatment and profile.
The study of Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in Medical Journal of日a.
In March 2012, 33 years of age, a young mother from the Golden Alish Nive said that she had an aggressive cancer of eggs.

The inflation is out of the release.
Should Russian grow rare prices
As a result of RF and Western sanctions, the inflation in Russia will be developed and will not be included in the prognoses of the authorities of the WTB Capital analysis.
According to experts, the consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, RBK Daily writes.
According to the latest proposal of the Mineconvolution, inflation was 6.5-7.5 per cent in 2014, and at least 6.5 per cent in the year.
However, the Commercent newspaper states that the MER must be "small but principles" in the macroeconomic prognoses until 2017.
According to the issue, science can reduce the inflation for 2015, which will allow the expected reduction of population income growth.
The prognoses suggested that the RF marketing sanctions would be the year before August 2015.
How could such a situation assume such a high inflation?
The current situation assumes a rare shock, but the humiliating inflation trend will not be changed, " said the source of the newspaper in Minfine.
Economys from the RTB Capitol do not share the expectations of the Government ' s financial-economic block of inflation and predict price growth in 2014 at 8%.
The basic effect of the product prohibitions will be in 2015, with the introduction in the RF regions of the sales tax (N); the experts have been acquired in 2015.
The inflation point of 9 per cent will come to the February, after which the price growth will be decreased by the experts.
Moreover, Rosstat led the first inflation results last week after the FF introduced "accurate sanctions".
AIF.ru asked experts and discovered their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, an analytic Department of FK AForex:
The price growth is already observed in the main sectors of goods.
Moreover, when a significant product was costed, the Government had to implement the measures of the system's price stability monitoring to prevent the risk of unbased price increase in a short-term perimeter.
Providers and leaders have already been reported on a daily basis before the regulatory bodies so that the authorities may know exactly who, for what reason and why, begins the increase of prices.
The key factors of the growth in consumer price index continue to remain a colossure, however, the capital flow, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megarial, the internal conversion for the escape of the population into the foreign currency, and the burden for the import of products from countries, are added to sanctions against Russia.
If the inflation pressure remained under control, the cost of the minimum set of products would not exceed 12 per cent for one quarter.
The prohibition of imports of products of producers' shock of proposals on the internal market and has led to a completely logical increase in the final value.
Since we are not able to completely launch the import mechanism and to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market on the basis of internal production, responsible sanctions continue to carry out the risk of growing inflation constituent.
If there is also a physical adjustment of reasons that have no confidence in the national currency, as well as the damage of economic growth, inflation can be over 8% at the end of this year.
Alexander Razwaev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
In the 90s, inflation at times reached 20-30 per cent per month, and at the zero, it was also higher than the current level, the second thing that the compensation was then a fast economic growth.
I think, at the end of the year, inflation is 8-8.5 per cent.
Platon Maguta, manager of assets of the Magotta Fond
The external factor with sanctions against Russia has been successfully sustained, but if further pressure occurs, primarily on the financial sector, it can lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflation expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally shown in the purchases of the cash currency to secure their detentions.
It may be suggested that the Government, the BC RF and the Ministry of Finance are attempted to reduce fluid weakness of the rubber and market methods and public regulations.
However, price growth begins traditionally after summer waste and may be more sensitive.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is at 7.5 per cent, mostly, as the RF is still financial.
Sadduceeous centres are decreased by decreasing the number of householders
Such a decreased decrease in the number of householders under 35 years may lead to that the garden centres will start to lose tens of millions of pounds per year when today's young consumers will have the "basic age of garden", the HTA study, which has reported Financial Times.
According to this report, the people who film the jail lose in average 55 per cent of the amount of their own households.
The increase in the number of people in high-urbanized areas without gardens is mentioned in the population of the assembly of courts in front of the house for parking and reducing the size of the garden as other factors that are threatening adults, the annual sale amount of £5 billion.
In Great London, where the number of householders fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest level in the United Kingdom for gardens for households.
HTA and the Royal Gardens Society reported that the arending and lack of space for garden does not mean that people cannot grow.
Gay Barter, the leader of the RHS Gardens adviser, said: "The management of containers, for example, is especially popular to the farmers who can carry out ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́
The HTA report determined the period between 1997 and 2005 as a "Gulden Age" different trade goods for garden as a result of increased number of householders and economic flows from the end of the 1980s to the middle of the 1990s.
It also predicts that the market will be improved this year by a better time after the unfortunate events in March and April last year.

Turkey calls for the American diploma in relation to the report on spionage
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey has called the highest American diploma in the country to explain the report on the American and British spionship in Turkey.
Prime Minister Bullent reported that the United States trusted in cases and Turkish offices had discussed a report on Monday.
The German Journal "Der Spiegel" and the "The Intercept" reported that the documents provided by the former analysis of the United States National Security Agency by Edward Snowden were a priority for the United States and the British Information Services.
According to the Turkish news agencies, the President of Turkey Redjep Tyip Erdogan understood the importance of this report, saying that all leading countries are spying each other.
In the previous reporting of the fact that Ankara was also informed by the German Major Intelligence Agency, the Turkish Government had a more wrath response.
The major Chinese companies were united against Alibaba
The Chinese companies, including the largest neighbourhood of the trade in China Dalian Wanda Group and the Internet Giants Tencent Holdings (sockets, mediators, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese searcher), create a company that will competite on the online market with Alibababa.
However, to find a wonder of the Chinese Internet, which left behind even its American opponents - eBay and Amazon.com, it will be not easy.
The Greatest Union
Companys are planning to include 5 billion Juan ($ 814 million), 70 per cent will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent of each of the Internet companies, as stated in Wanda Group.
The registration of the company is planned in Hong Kong.
○ Combines Baidu's search services with the WeChat's Pope (the most largest assembly in China, the number of users of approximately 438 million people), Tencent and Wanda's infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 flash hotels, the Wanda group is managed by at least 49 commercial insurance items throughout China and 40 trade centers.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion Yuani (more than 8 billion dollars) in the construction of China and the theme of a park of times in Singapore (town on Eastern China in the Green Sea).
The project is expected to attach more than 1 million visitors annually and offer $960 million.
Furthermore, Wanda belongs to the American AMC Entertainment Holdings movie network, which makes the company a major film operator worldwide.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its trade centres, hotels and locations with e-commerce services, which will take place as a concurrent of Alibaba.
According to Dun Ce, which will enhance the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of their e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million to the year.
The new area must be the largest form of the world online to offline, says Dun Ce.
The online-to-offline business office (O2O) is involved in purchasing the Internet buyers in order to make them available in normal offline stores or in other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O I'm being used for the sale of cookies like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the greatest "pyrog" on the online commercial," said Wanda Van Zhinhinlin's rue (cited by Bloomberg).
"The current O2O area in China does not exist, and in this situation the opportunities are about all," he considers.
The Chinese Internet Trade Market is the greatest in the world, and, according to McKinsey & Co., its amount will increase more than three times until 2015, compared to 2011, up to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese internet operators increased up to 632 million, and Bloomberg provides official statistics: more people of any world, except India.
And it is a predict that this number can grow up to 850 million people until 2015.
The Joint of the Richest
Chapter Tencent Ma Huattan was the most rich man of China, however, the index of the Bloomberg Agency of millions, based on Alibababa Jack Ma has already been charged with $ 5.5 billion.
Jack Ma is estimated at $21.8 billion, from which $11 billion come to its share in Alibaba.
Ru Baidu Robin Lee now takes the third place among the richest people of China, while Van Zhinhinhin from Wanda is the fourth range of rating.
"For this battle, it is very interesting to observe: three of the richest people are engaged in rejecting the calls more rich," said Bloomberg's Chinese Centre for Electronic Commerce in Hanchjou Cao Lay.
But he thinks that the new company would almost be able to compete with Alibaba after the creation: "Rome builds for one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not simply to resist not only new companies but also to the world trade leaders, it is evident that the report on the financial indicators of Alibaba has been repeated in the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something more average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company had more than both of its American competitors taken together.
The pure acquisition of Alibaba for almost twice exceeds the similar summary indicator of competitors - it has increased almost three times in the year calculation and was 1.99 billion dollars.
"Alibaba still has a great potential for generating money, in many ways thanks to its mobile applications," is the Bloomberg analysis report from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibababa on the US Value Paper and Birge Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, which is more than the March Indicator (163 million people).
In this case, 32.8 per cent of all Alibababa transactions in the past quarter came on the device mobies.
Alibaba should be called the value of its actions before the IPO.
According to the average evaluation of 11 analystes requested by Bloomberg, the company can be assessed at $187 billion after the sale of the shares.
According to Bloomberg's sources, Alibababa at New York Fund Barge (NYSE) may be held on 16 September.
Road-show company before this event starts on 3 September.
It is expected that the outcome of Alibababa to the IPO will be recorded in the NYSE history and allow the company to take about $20 billion.
Before this point, the record on the amount of resources in the United States borders belonged to the Visa-based system, which had made its prime allocation in 2008 for $17.9 billion.
At least half of the commercial products in trade networks must be Russian production, but the Hosdam deputats are deputed.
They had once a draft law on this subject.
References and - Amendments to Article 8 FZ " On the basis of the public trade regulation in the RF " and on the Tax Code.
The objective of the document is to introduce protection measures for Russian producers of productivity.
The significant adjustment of the legislation project must be at least 50 per cent of the product of the domestic production in the stores in each type of goods.
However, the document will consider that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as fruits and five winters, so they will be made a "skin" to avoid a possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends to the Tax Code RF, which establishes a decreased rate of NDS in 10 per cent in the implementation of all products of origin of Russia, reports the newspaper.
On 27 August, the draft draft Law on the introduction of changes to the FA on different markets, which would restore agricultural markets in Russia in which small producers of the figs would have to produce their production.
The Police Chef of Magalufa has made a conviction in corruption
It was evident that the police and officers of the Municipality of Calvia were required at the Office of the State Prosecutor Malorica on Friday.
The head of Calvia's police on the curriculum island of Mallork was arrested due to the corruption of businessmen and bar owners in the scandal center of the unexpected beverage of Magalufe.
The Master Inquireor Hose Antonio Navarro was replaced by the accusations of corruption against him by several businessmen with Punta Ballene, the streets in which the majority of the bars and the Night Clubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the annual online report of Mallorca Diario, the issues have demonstrated that the police and officers of Calvia's municipality at the Mallorca Prosecutor's office for the fight against corruption on Friday.
Two other police officers were arrested by the Guarantee of the National Garde of Spain for the convictions of corruption and were invited by the judge with Navarro.
Spanish everyday of the ABC reported that the Night Club owners said that protectionism from the authorities is seriously reflected in their business status.
"It is no longer to say about money, money and survival," one of the businessmen said to the court.
Without putting our sources in danger.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the heading of the international press this year after the pope of a video role on YouTube, in which a 18-year-old British relaxer had been shown to 24 men during the running of bars.
The authorities of the island are trying to interrupt humidity in uncircumcised state among the repairs of Magaluf, aware of the minimum quantity of scandal alcohol flows on bars.
Moreover, the Playhouse club, where an incident had occurred, was forced to close for a year while Playhouse and the Carnage bars were jointly traveled for $55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist currency of Magaluf, mainly, was the Pope among young British relaxants, also placed a number of accidents in the situation of alcohol-free drinking with a stupid fun, like "balconing", when people climb from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel base.
The first day of the festival is noted by mockery and wind conditions affecting flights at Adelaide Airport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise in south of South Australia by bringing rain and winds that affected the airport at Adelaide.
More five mm rain fell on the city at night to 9 night, after 6,6 mm, you're on Sunday night.
The latest rain was a couple of short wind-breaking winds, including the wind that started almost to eight nights and sprinkled nearly 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter had exposed the early weight portion last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to Ma'mum only 15.8C in the city.
The lowly conditions, likely, have served one of the reasons for delaying the Virgin Airlines travel from Melbourne in Adelaide.
The airplane had to be landed after 7:30 a.m., but it was in the wind movement zone, suddenly changed speed or wind direction, and it was required to get the height.
Wind breaks reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to get the height during the second landing, and the flight finally landed about 8:40 dinner.
The delay of this flight caused the next delay of several other flights, including Emirates from Dubai and Qantas from Sidney.
16C is presented in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two lines.
The calculation of building objects in the RF will take place again
Questions of censure, building growth management, as well as the problems of connecting to networks, the Federal Antimonopholic Service will be controlled.
FAS has been established by an expert board on the development of competition in the building area.
At its meeting, the Chairman of Control of ICH, Building and Natural Resources of FAS Watdim Soluvius stated that "the current accounting of structural objects is absolutely incomprehensible."
The North Base makes prices intransparency and can lead to an unbased building price, which is considered in the FAS.
And the valuable cost of the construction of hostility objects at the drafting stage is to determine the market prices to the active solutions that are applied in place of today's accounting standards and unique assessments for technological operations.
These proposals are "to the map" and are currently discussed in the minery.
" The replacement of the traditional accounting documentation in the building of accounts to active elements should lead to smaller corruption in adults," explained the GBB's Watdim Soluvia.
Since every ball and hair is now counted, and it is not always likely to check everything, sometimes in the documentation, non-conscious buildings of the company can be buried by "the entire tractor".
In the FASS mines.
"The first of the estimates of the values for the active elements already exists: once the cost calculation methods for the co-active decisions, the calculation of these indicators, the race of the GBB, the head of the Department of Department of Department of Department of Department of Department of Department of Department of Department of Department of Department of Department of Department of Department of Department of Department of Elena Jukov.
As a pilot, the road building area is selected.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the GBB's head of the Profi-Invest Anatolio Demianko, the estimated standards have been old, but the other business mechanism has not been proposed yet.
"Where the accounts are related to the active elements, it is difficult to make it difficult, since in the building of the opinions, often different technologies are used," he considers.
It is not a secret that the building is developed in many ways through the hostage.
According to the PR Chairman of the NP " The Expert Professional Affairs Community" of the Ecaterines of Lesina, the State is today the most payable commander.
The Engineering Director of the Rossatomo Vladimir Malachov's capital building center noted that the market is currently divided into companies with access to contract portfolio and companies owning monopoly competences and not allowing competitors in this field.
He believes that the establishment of a transparency market is possible only when the access to contracts will be maximally threatened by any manager's effect.
The expert Council was proposed to form the hostage system so that one of the same artists would not be able to receive more than one contract of more than one billion rubs or a few contracts for more than one billion rubs.
In the mines, this approach should be identified as a view of the impact of business and the effectiveness of building management.
As Helena Jukov explained, in this case, it will be necessary to provide a geno-distributor for the functions that will lead to an increase in the public number of engineers and the budgetary expenditure for its content.
In this context, the guardian specialists will have knowledge to evaluate the quantity of subordinates and their safety.
At the same time, it will often be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the object.
Furthermore, this approach may be eligible by high-qualified hosts in relation to the independence of the receipt of an incomplete State prohibition and a small amount of the contract.
The contracts of the Expert-Consultation Centre of the University of Buyers Alexander believe that the guest procedure has now become a business game to the deputy's attention.
And he introduced such example: "Part on the compliance of the application must specify "specific indicators" without indicating the words: "or equivalent", "better", "mire", " analogue", "or" "type", "only type", "not below", "before", "before", "before", "not before", "not above", "not above", "not allowed" or "before".
Thus, the complainants often misuse their right to establish the requests for the content of the application provided by the subordinate.
Another problem of 44-FZ, as a result, was needed to be assessed at the stage of the application of quality of work through the "bound" proposal of the participant.
As a result of the request of the participant, only a debt can be evaluated, but not the quality of which they have not yet been implemented, the expert states.
The amount of the amount is only to be evaluated when they are receipt.
The expert Council was also proposed to transfer marginal income from the below asheol to the extent that intermediate subsequents could be disappeared.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, the Secretary of the Secretary of the FAS Andrew Carikovski, considers that it is not worth, since the geno-subordinator must be responsible for the order.
And otherwise, the Arcadia Raikin's reprise "Atelle" will be done: "There's a claim to the pigs?"
Israeli children return to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israelites in the territory near the Gaza sector returned to school on Monday after having passed a summer in bombs, when rackets and mines fell on their habitation during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza sector remained closed when the territory was restored after war.
The beginning of school jobs brought the joy and anxiety to those suffering from the racket of the South Israel residents, but the tracks of fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the "Pash" garden, in which the racket came, was removed from the wall and the mountains before the disciples came.
"We're a little afraid but we're happy to get in the future," said Ronit Bart, Kibuz Saad inhabitant and English teacher at his school.
Many people in our area really need to return to a large life.
She's 11-year-old daughter, Shanny Bart, said that she suddenly started to go to school "nearly strange."
"There was a difficult time, and we're not really you're from your homes," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibuz that is situated near the border of Gaza to express its support.
Before the Fire ' s agreement stopped war last week, thousands of residents of border villages such as Saad, you did not hold on the street or leave your homes, walking to more safe areas from the Gaza sector to be saved from the racket and mineral fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, near the border of Gaza, where the Palestinian mine was killed by a four-year-old boy, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a decade of families were not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for that time.
The Premier Minister Benjamin Nathaniahu visited the school in Sderote, the city of the border of Gaza, which was very excited from the Palestinian fire.
He advised the students to learn diligently and said, "We will do all that is possible to give you knowledge and security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on a timely reconciliation on the last Tuesday.
The agreement on the end of the war, however, remained key issues, such as Hamas' request for the landing of the Egyptian block of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza sector.
Israel wants Hamas to put a weapon and return the body of two Israeli soldiers who were destroyed in the war.
It is expected that the new stage of immediate negotiations will begin later in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2100 Palestinians, among whom three quarters were peaceful citizens, and at least 494 children, under the assessments of the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel discharges these numbers and claims that at least half of the killed were warriors; yet, he does not prejudice the evidence of the evidence that it is confirmed.
From Israel, 66 soldiers and six peaceful inhabitants, including one Thai.
During the fighting of Hamas and other Gaza warriors, 4591 racket units and mines were released in Israel's cities, primarily southern country.
Israel’s army, then, had committed more than 5000 aircraft and other attacks.
As a result of Israel ' s attacks, thousands of houses in the Gaza sector were hurt and disrupted, and, according to estimates, 250,000 people found a refuge in more than 100 schools, converted into premises.
Because the tens of thousands of people were still in vacation, and the fights continued, the leaders who were responsible for education took the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be opened so that we can finish our education as children of the world and the Jewish children," Mohammed Amar, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a Gaza school.
According to the Pope's criteria, the prices for inevitability showed the maximum winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic price prices in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reported RP data on Monday.
This increase has led to a total increase in June, July and August to 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth of 10.9 per cent, more than two more than 12 months to August 2013, but the increase was not equally distributed by the country.
The RP Data Data Research Director Tim Loules reported that Sidney and Melbourne were two-level markets.
The RP Data figures are that in Sydney, the prices on the jail increased by 16,1 per cent in the last year, while in Melbourne are 11.7 per cent.
The following markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where average prices increased from five to six per cent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which requested government reductions in expenditure, increased only by 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lowess said that when the weight was started, the increase in the number of insurance objects for sale will be observed in the next few months, which will be the "actual trial" for the market.
"As regarding the current high level of auktion speed, the general sale speed and the current conditions with low rate, it is likely that the value of the rail will grow in the following three months," he said.
How people in the oldest house of Uphh
In the former house of golden industry and forests, Ivan Demid and his son, on the street of October Revolution, 57/1 (ex-Great Casana) are 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has been unchanged from the time of the building.
Foreign people are going here, as for the excursion, and the walls suffer more than they rejoice, because of their privilege, the right to live in the older Ufim house, which the walls of Alexander Suvorov's half.
The date of the building of the house is inaccurate, the historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But, in any case, it is found that the view of a few 300 years of age.
An old court, always open door, screwing the stairs.
The doors in the apartment are divorced near each other, the walls were cut down, and in the lights of the flashing places are seen by the places.
It seems to be honest.
And the inhabitants assured, "It is not yours."
It is very difficult to live in the tree house of the 18th century, says Tatian Lukianov, a resident of the apartment No. 3.
The object is on the holiday, but the money for its content is not distributed for decades, but we feel musical exposures that the authorities simply forgot.
The last reparation was 40 years ago.
The walls are still safe, but the fountain has lost it.
Many kitchens go to the street toilet until this time, and moving once a week in the public bathroom.
How can we be satisfied in such conditions?
The road is running right under windows, there isn't even a preliminary area.
Tatiana's covering the tissue.
Now, it is evident that there was only a hearing before: the car flow is under the windows.
See, the glasses are slow, the windows can't be opened, but they've been used to the sound.
But a man is used to all things, to good and bad.
Our apartment is still a model, thanks to the husband, his hands are golden.
Moreover, two camels we have, we live in the second way with his son.
And other families have much worse conditions, at the second stage half a half meters higher.
For the opposite of Tatian, he will go to a neighbor from the apartment No. 6 of Ludmile of the Age.
A pleasant hostile woman has a coffee coffee and with a huge smile, says:
We have a single apartment, 14,5 m2 per four persons, so we live: we and our husband and daughter with a grandson.
I've been here since my birth, and there's never been any other residence -- Ludmila's sight of the comma: antresols, two divan letters "g"; on one of them, a teenager was divided with a laptop.
Very hard and little is different from the ordinary parental interview: only a half of beautiful, "historic".
However, the rule is running: the water supply system is nowhere.
Ludmila speaks of her apartment dinner and amazingly at the same time as the Italian house in Rome's ruins.
It is a very old and recent, daily and annual:
Water drives about 40 years ago during the last reparation.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the cotton and a toilet from the former hearing.
We live just where the quarter of Demida and the family lived on the second stage.
Our apartment is not private, and why?
The Centre of Innovation states that privatisation does not have any meaning.
Still, we'll only get a single apartment, we can't have any more.
Four months ago, we have been promised to displace us, but the promised thing has not gone further.
I'm not used to complain or I'm not.
In this apartment, my grandmother and my dad, I and my husband and my daughter with my grandmother.
Everything was for that time.
For example, healthy crosses were running through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the floor, they're a metro wall!
They say the solution was injected on the eggs, so it's so long.
The house is built basically, thanks to Demida!
It may be that it is why no one has murdered with a deceitful or his own.
Only the building still dies slowly in our eyes: the boards and the houses are wounded, the fields have fallen once, we've wrapped the cement, but the devil's all -- the solution goes to the ground like a cow.
They say, so is, under our coming secret laz and walking to the White River, which has been specially made by older men here so that they can be hidden from the danger, in the case of what.
Their persecution.
Ludmila Starstyn tells them how some historian came to them, asked him to let him start in the apartment.
And then he won them to give them a residence in exchange for its one on October.
Ludmila historic from:
Where are we four in one?
And here, at least, there's a hope that they'll give you more space.
We agreed to exchange, we wouldn't win anything anymore.
Nevertheless, the Ancient's family did not win anything.
The biggest worry of Ludmila to displace them, and the daughter of 16-year-old child gave her a council.
To two families, two families have assigned a double apartment instead of the greatest ruins in which two generations will now be.
The Simpatic, Miniature of Olesse Karsakov from apartment No. 11 and 12 shows the second stage of home.
There are two deep places of a total area of 23 m2, named apartments, its large family lives.
We're seven people, two children.
You're seeing the conditions.
It is rejected by cups, as well as the frames, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rocks.
Water in the corner is only cold.
During the apartments of Ufa's oldest house, you can be sure that more happier than all Lawrenti's wives from the apartment No. 4.
They take the most space comms of the first stage.
You're right, a lot of places!
A room of 75 squares, three people were assigned.
We live just in the camels where Subors remained at the end, while they lived in Ufe, says Alexander Dmitrievich Lawrentiev's family head.
They're very high, space.
One bad thing is that it's all around, it's broken, it's crazy.
The neighbors may have already told them!
Most of the torture we have with the fields: the tree tables were cut down, the earth was literally departed from the foot.
I'm on my hands, kidneys; there's nothing yet in the room, and in the other camel, as we're walking on the rocks, so much is the cup.
The house of the buyer, Demid, Alexander Dmitrievich, can be told better than any exhaustion.
The golden industrialist is like a family, and he is exciting.
In fact, the person was uncontrolled: the Master of the Kagine and the Uzian Travels built houses, broke guns and colloque, holded Ural rounds.
The inheritants of the purchasing inevitability are in front of them, but they do not want to live under one cover of the story.
I lived here as a child in the 40s of the 20s, says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wood places around for the caret, the horse, and the buildings, and then the buildings.
In 1968, we wanted to remove our house, but something hindered...
The story was repeated in 2014: it was rebuilt with a new jealousy.
As the team, we collected all documents, we had the needed institutions and suddenly learned that the transfer to the apartment was transferred to 2015 or 2016.
Something we don't believe it anymore...
Two years ago, Lawrenti went to the Ministry of Culture of the Resp of Baskhortostan to learn about the judgment of the house.
The factors of the wheel haven't accepted.
They sent from one table to another and then, as a smile, issued a paper without signing and printing: "The Ministry of Culture doesn't reflect on the division of bullets."
I even felt that our house was not in the city for a long time, because the dream was under number 57, then 57 A and now 57/1.
It's like he's been taken down in the 70s.
The "Russian Planet" was referring to the inhibiting sector of the Agricultural Resources Management Working Affairs of Vladimir Barabbash.
The Road House of October Revolution 57/1 is included in the Old Yellow Disassembly Programme.
I can't answer the actions of the 70s, but I know that the plan was at that time for all old houses, despite historical importance.
Fortunately, this has not occurred, and the decision of modern authorities - to restore all the old houses in the street of October Revolution, which represent the valuable value, is successfully implemented.
The railways are soon planned to move on new apartments.
According to Barabbash, the restoration of Demida's House will be Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of comments in Venice.
It is now in Italy that is a community, and the "Old Upha" project is represented there among others.
I hope that all ancient Kazanians will be restored to 2016, says the leader.
The house will be obtained a suitable species corresponding to those who were before, three centuries ago.
Demida's house, mostly, will be a museum open for all who want.
Moreover, at the Government level, it was decided to make the street at the outcome of the past.
Unfortunately, there will be too big threats in the city.
The future Museum of Vladimir Barabbas promised in 2015.
Yet, they will not be sufficient, but their new apartments will be the same area as the present.
Just from the other time.
Forest fire started in Primoria
The dry hair was the cause of the emergency of forest fire in the Territorium of the Forest Others in the Fire Country of the Prize-Sea.
The promotion of the grouping of forces and resources is carried out on the compensation.
According to the KGSBU Guideline of the Prize Aviation Aviation, the conditions established on fire are required for the aviation forces.
Basiley Medvedev, Vice-President of the Aviation:
The fire in difficult access has been found by an aircraft-service from the board of the aircraft An-2 at the border of 3 hectares.
The wood residues are burning on the old burner.
Strengthening of the territory and a crucial decline of more than 45 degrees, the lack of advantages to the dessenders of fire areas creates a meaning of complexity in the dust.
We need a Mi-8 hot.
The delivery of forces available to the Mi-2 hotel and An-2 airport is very difficult.
After the fire was found on the dust place, four fire-parasuites were operatively set up.
The main task of specialists is to burn fire and to prepare areas for additional forces and fuel resources.
In the village of the village of O, there were additional 3 fire designers in the village.
As soon as the hostel is prepared for placing the fire area, specialists will be transferred to the dust, reported on the Prize-Sea administration site.
Lenny Henry: My father never met me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the seven children born in the Imigrant family from Jamaica in Dadley in Midland in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked on the factory, and they were worthwhile.
Henry repeated the "Red Plastics of Rudy", which is partly on his father and has grown from a series of transfers to Radio 4.
Soundtrack is a mix of reggs and repa, and the melodies are life-free.
However, Henry was supposed to go through some difficult memories.
After his mother's death, he was "much" treatment, and Henry often thinks about her father's ambition.
He was very inappropriate.
You never saw him. You just heard his voice, "Stop sounding.
Get away from your sister.
Shit!
I want to look at the cricket.
My elderly brothers, Simur and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, talked with him in pabs and talked about things like the beer, the beauty of a cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an insulting guy in the corner, who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a league mastership in Dadley, and although the conditions were better than in his father's days, he could look at what his life must have been.
There's a little better, but it's dark, smooth, the depth of labyrinths in the bottom of fire and smoke and dogs.
My father went into the bathroom and was just lying there, and you heard him start slowly sing about himself because he wanted to get away from the league master.
When I came there, I understood that he did this for years and years to make us a question, and I was more appreciating it.
Nevertheless, Henry went out of the existence of parental love.
My dad never took up, he never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom was bad at the end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love he had not enough.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop taking me!
Dad, I have 22!
With Don Frank.
Why don't I come with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with Frank whose 25 years he was married.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I go with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had a diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So when I was very corrected and I had the symptoms of the diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take a radical measure.
Then I started serious jobs with fitness, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get out of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And that's pretty.
No one eats a marble.
The exchange of carrier tractory of Henry is probably reflected in his nice, shortly supported degree.
Since he received the critics of his Otello, he was fully carrying out the theater.
It followed the "Feeled Commit" and then "Forgets" of August Wilson.
This work is different from sickcomes and comedies that were an incomplete attribute of its nutritional life.
He started his career when he was 16 years old and worked on the factory.
Didgey noticed how he's pardoning on the scene, and wrote about it in "News".
His television career started in the middle of the seventy years: "I was the only black patrol/comic on TV for a long time."
He's learned at the school.
I didn't only have to grow in the eyes of p.a., but I had to learn to be an effective machine for the delivery of shots between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in "News" in 1975
Since his manager had the right to the Black and white shooting show, he broke the program in which the people had "sharpened their face", Henry discovered what it was in it for five years.
My family didn't like it.
I think I want it never to be with me, but I don't regret what I did.
Although this was a strange, worth of judgment, I worked in large areas and learned to work with a crowd.
But what was "the easily recompense of a classic division on the British TV of years and years," it was also "the great family of black people".
In representation of the persons who were also understood by the culture of black boys in the United Kingdom and who had been sing it, Henry worked at an alternative comedian project in the eighteen.
The first season of Shaw Lenny Henry was translated in 1984, and at the nineteenth, he was like, among other things, Geret Blacklock's head of the comedian series of "Chef!".
Advertising roles, documents of films, teleseries and roles in the movie took the ten years of his life, but after it seized on the BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv", he thought, "What are you going to do, Len, because you're a little bit of time or relaxing to the side."
There's been a series of documental transfers to Radio 4 called "What's Good to...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy on Shakespeare.
Without saying that I'm so learned at school, and I think this is, in many ways, the prerogation of white people in the middle class with cocktails and the throat downwards.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone with whom we had an interview to transfer, Peter Hall, Trevor Nan, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't worry about it until you know what you're talking about.
Make some of these words listen, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from the last monolog of Otello for documental transfer, and he was arrested.
I felt that I could do it.
It's like it's been corrected.
"This is a serious matter, it's serious, learning your text, conducting a little study.
The repetition process was hard, and I read this pesce for months and months before we set it up.
She had a success too.
It seemed that they were waiting for disasters and it wasn't happening.
We started the "Mistake Commitment".
I was suddenly in the National Theater, and I couldn't believe that until the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
A technical failure occurred, and Henry's instinct felt that his business was once.
"The voice inside me said, "You'll have to work 10 minutes until they make a computer."
Instead, the register assistant declared that the presentation would be renewed as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene and something in me said, "Oh, praise God."
It's not my obligation.
I can let someone else get out of it.
"You're playing a pice, stay in the role."
Henry in "Forget" in the Dacess theater
It was hard to learn the text for the "Boots".
Panica is quite useful, she's strengthening the muscle.
She was also accepted well, so it was like a sign above, saying, "This is what you have to do."
He's saying this, of course, by the GROMEV.
So I'm keeping it.
I really like that.
I like to be in the repetitive room.
In fact, Henry's still thinking of comic -- all the way -- talks break his humor's insults when he starts it, it's going to end up.
I just decided not to work at the stand, because this thing with a timely recompense from the entire community of strangers, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you're trying to do this all the time, it can lead to a crap.
I'm sometimes working at the Right Ether in Apollo when I want, but in general, I don't get such a pleasure as before.
I'm asking if he's going to give a turn on a stain.
The pleasure to sit in the room with a register that helps to give the form of start, middle and end of the road - I don't think I would never want to refuse it.
So that's his new place?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's a pleasant fun.
You always tell some story, and here's a great place for it.
I like stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public servants to find " invisible invisibles"
Kenya started a biometric register of all public servants in trying to remove the " invisibles" from the government ' s famous knowledge.
Co-operators who are not registered during two weeks will no longer be reported in the Government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive payments after abandoning the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyata has promised to reduce corruption in public structures after reaching the authority in 2013.
The audit check of the previous year found that at least 1 million dollars ($700000) per month are lost by the payment of " invisibles" and other financial offences.
The Government suspects that payments continue to work on bank accounts, even after a person dies or remains in the public service, reporter BBC Vanjam Chebusi from the capital, Nairobi.
All State officers must appear within two weeks of identity to ensure that their data are collected by a biometer of registration procedure, reported in the Government statement.
Anyone who doesn't do this without a reason of respect will be drawn out from awareness, it will be reported in it.
"This procedure is rationalized by determining a real number of public servants, and will also be used to cleanse the knowledge at both levels of the Government - thus ending the issue of " Invisible Invisibles", said Anne Waygur, the secretary of the Ministry of Planning and structuring of the Authority.
Decades of Turkish police are arrested for the " contract" against the Government
At the total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey for suspicion in the " negotiation against Government" reported by the in-contracting agencies.
Police representatives do not have a commitment to this information.
Among the arrested were 14 highly posted officers, reported by Hurrieth Daily News.
They participated in the outcome of corruption in the past December, including four Governing Ministers.
In July, several of the Turkish police were arrested by suspect in the establishment of organized crime grouping and telephone audience.
The Turkish president Redzep Tayip Erdogan (which was at that time a Prime Minister) determined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and other authorities, the Islamian Clinician Pethulah Gulen.
Not all the children returned to school in Ukraine.
Schools in most of Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer canicles.
This day is traditionally a big event for the family, and, as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, the Prime Minister Arsenia Jacenuk took his daughter to school.
There he said to the expected journalists that not all schools were opened again, but that he would do all possible to protect the country for future generations:
In September 1, the ceremonie passed not at every school.
There is no peaceful heaven over every part of Ukraine.
We have to go to the peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, a great Ukrainian people's front, must be at peaceful heavens.
Alexan Pastuchov, the director of the school in Slovenia, where the daughter of Jacenuka went, spoke Russianly.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be in their life.
The first day of learning are traditionally noted by the hope that children hope up to the high-scale, keep air-scale in their hands, and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an emergency rue that she needs
There is a sleep of glory from the world of banking business, MME management and Tory's internal partial circles.
In fact, she has her own experience of work on the roads of staff.
Her career started in a consulting company on the global Bain and Co management, and then continued to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and in the Pearsons world.
She was a financial timer for seven years, leaving a vacation when a high post in the Pearson's company took a colleague with a lower job.
They say that it approaches £1 million.
Its political assessment is also ready.
She was recommended to David K’eron Lord Brown, the ex chapter of the BP, when he tried to bring special experts from the private sector to Whitehall: she became a adviser of the office of ministers.
Her husband's former adviser Tory.
Earlier in May, I called the president with a stuck cow.
BBC is not only a big and complex in the heart of the public, but there is a internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two directions: inside as a level of management of the same BBC, but I will also outside as a voice of public concern and anxiety when something is wrong.
This is almost an inappropriate duopoly, which is a full radical series.
However, what new chairman will risk the arrival of the Institute as difficult as the Chinese dynamic if he loses his own work in this process.
It's a difficult solution.
It would not be so difficult that many people would be happy to see how BBC will be reduced, after reviewing its powers, financial and status.
Since competitors suffocate circulation and new output technologies, unsafely negotiations on the value of the licence constitute a danger for BBC.
For a small amount of £145,50 per year, britains will have a share in the world's largest media undertakings.
The BBC tells the good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of homeholds and cost each of them only 40p daily.
Moreover, it is evident that the population of Beeb is: 53 per cent support it today against 31 per cent of 10 years ago.
BBC's models have changed: I now get news headers on a phone and see iPlayer's missing programs.
However, it remains very popular and inexcusable.
He needs an exciting president-- I hope it found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating twitter was written to someone else
The Twitter from the account of the Governor of Texas rep, Rick Perry, on Sunday evening contained a criminal representation of the democracy prosecutor of the democracy, which is in the centre of a voting persecution in the misuse of authority.
The Twitter was later removed and followed another of the Perry accounts in which the record was discovered.
Only from my account, the twitter was repeated, which was written to someone outside.
"I don't approve this twitter and I have removed it," reports a later record.
Perry's assistants did not respond to the requested comments.
Although the records were threatened by the Perry account, it was unexpected who actually worked in this band.
More early twitter contained an unleavened carrier on the prosecutor of Travis Rosmery Lemberg, who recognized the guest in the situation of the surgery in April 2013.
Perry has prohibited her knowledge when she has been leaving to a delay that led to the course of a large jury in Austin this month against Perry, which is a potential candidate in the elections of the presidents in 2016.
The signature in yours says, "I'm not always driving a car in the condition of drinking, three times above the allowable level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do this, I'm proclaiming the guvernor Perry's accusations for his talk to me about it."
I'm the most drunk democrate in Texas.
Lemberg's science did not carry out research with a large jury against Perry.
Michael Crum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by judge-resp.
Perry did not recognize himself as a guilty and called a political claim.
His powerful legal team requested the judge who had the case, to reject the accusation act, stated that the law used to pursue the Governing Board, who exercised its obligations for all over the whole history of Texas, would deceive that the constitution would be contrary.
Perry stopped $7.5 million from the State of Public Control Division, which is based in the Travis area, and followed corruption in the public sector of Texas when Lemberg was released.
Vito has made an official complaint from the public control group with left views.
The Lenta under the Perry account is often updated - and sometimes become known.
When the fifth party arrived in Iowa during its presidential campaign in 2012, Perry answered that he could go out of the game with a twitter with the picture of himself running near the lake, and said, "There are we, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the insurance market returned to "normal status"
One of the most of Londra's maintenants warned that the market of immobility in South-East England was "returned" to the normal level of activity.
The house in the capital was the subject of a survived question and an effortful price, and the fear that the credit puzzle would undermine the Bank of England in order to establish hypothetical interests in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgeley, the designer and president of the Berkeley Elite Building Company, said, "The market has returned to the normal level of 2013 transition," adding that it has guaranteed the "stable slave environment".
The London insurance market succeeded during the fall, since foreign buyers went to the capital.
The prices in the city were decreased by 18,5 per cent in one year only, according to the landquarters given, with an average indicator of 6.7 per cent in England and Wales in total.
The average market prices for private, accessible and student schemes of Berkeley increased to approximately one fifth year last, with £423000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in the past months has reduced London's impairment to foreign purchasers, some of which have also stopped the introduction of new taxes for insurance and political ritories around the potential " tax on ́a' tax" before the general elections in May.
The London Insurance Agency of Foxtons last week had warned that the April re-market of the Hypothetic Market, which introduced more heavy supply conditions, would also lead to the decrease of market growth as the sales of unnecessary and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England showed the fall of the number of approved hypotetic loans in June, assuming further refrigeration on the rail market.
Hamptons International, another insurance agency, has reduced its prediction of the growth of prices for London involving for 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis of the deterioration of prices.
The amount of transactions at the same time has fourth comparison to the previous year in the most decent regions of London, such as Chelsea, Mayer and Kencington, according to WA Ellis' information.
Nevertheless, the question at the chair was very beneficial for Berkeley, taking up the sale amount of £2,2 billion.
Mr. Pidgeley added: "The question of the goods needed with a good design and better location remained old and, reflecting this, the sales for a time period were maintained."
In June, the company reported that 3742 new houses had been sold in this year until the end of April - almost a third more than in the 2007 Docryz point.
The annual income to tax payment was 40 per cent compared to £380 million last year, and the income was $18 per cent to €1,6 billion.
By speaking on Monday before the annual company assembly, Mr. Pidgeley reported that Berkeley's estimated income would comply with the current market expectations for this year.
According to the single analysis, an annual arrival is expected for £450 million before tax payment.
The value of Berkeley's action was $23,96 in the second half day on the London branch.
The photographs of Jennifer Lawrence op are made on the Internet by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence comes to the 85th ceremonie of the annual premium of the American cinema.
The photographs of Jennifer Lawrence's accommodated actor, received by Oscar Prince, were made on the Internet by hacker, which assures that the "catalog" of 100 other upcoming stars is holding.
The representative of the "Fearly Games" star confirmed that Lawrence's graphics were true and condemned the hacker for the "appeal income into the private space".
It has been conducted by the legal protection authorities, and they will pursue any person who is being stolen by Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally placed on the 4chan exchange site were probably obtained by the lack of Apple iCloud's online storage system, and the proposed "catalog" of inflamming victims includes the names of a decade of women-names, including Rianna, Kim Cardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary Cate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
It is not clear how many of these figures are true, although the "Scott Pilgrim" star against all" Winsted in Your owner also condemned the disgrace.
"The one who looks at the graphs we've made with his husband a few years ago, getting out of the house -- I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winsted in Your owner.
However, Victoria Justis from the Nickolodeon "iCarly" series and "Victoria Victoria Victory" rejected it in your graphs, wrote: "These are so called me FALSHYWKY, people.
Let's stop it in the rock.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of the pop-stars of Arian Grande rejected what it would like to be true.
Exclusive exhibition from the new Roman Howard Jacobson on love and letter "J", calling for critics
They were dissolved, best to say exactly so, they gradually disappeared as the carton box left under the rain.
Only sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, difficult in society, stressed, closed and perhaps a little disappointed.
And then she pressed his hand.
He's seen anxiety in himself.
He's been stuck like a kid, yes.
The latest sacrifice of this cup was a small role from which he waited more than usually, deliverance from the single and difficult life and perhaps even any satisfaction.
Aline Solomons was a tremendous cup of beautifulness with horsed hair and the heart of the north town of the island, even more remote and harder than Port Royben.
She came to the south with an older partner, which Kevern had considered her tea, and then received her home in the sure, but seemed to be a paradise valley called the “Ray valley”.
No one lived in the house for a few years.
The fucking woods, in the bags, had a powder, left their tracks on all windows that are confident that the house belongs to them; the garden has grown up as a bullet like the giant cups.
It looked like a cottage from the book of the book, that was at the same time terrified and marvelous, with a full secret garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose "J" romance is included in the Long List of the Buker Prince in 2014.
Shortlist will be published on the week
Kevern and Eilin were sitting at hands, in broken shoes among the high grass, enjoying unexpectedly the warm hot hot day; they were both fully joined to a rain console that defeated the country of peaceful and calm news when, looking at its baptized root feet, he remembered the old song of a forgot black artist, who loved listening to his father, leaving the stones in the house.
You have too big feet.
Because of their aggressiveness, such songs on the console were no longer lost.
They were not prohibited, nothing was forbidden, but they were no longer lost.
They were helped to become archaetic, just as the word "faculty".
The Community Worship did what could never be done by orders and provisions, and as among the books people chose the poor memories of poverty, cultural books and loving romans, they chose ballades.
At this day, Kevern began to play in a fortepiano and a comic voice to sing the big foots of Eilin.
Aline didn't understand.
"This was a pope's song of a jazz pyanyer named Fats Waller," he said to her, with two fingers on the mouths.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she goes out of his mouth.
It started with the game they played when he was a little.
His father played in her with his father as he told him.
Start the word with "J", forgetting to apply two fingers to your mouth, and it's gonna be your penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew he was waiting for it, that's all.
He had to explain what the jazz is.
Eilin never heard him.
Jaz wasn't playing, even though he wasn't openly prohibited.
Improvization out of the mode.
There's only one place in life if.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
That's exactly the same thing with the ostroum.
His inappropriateness was a snare for people.
And jaz was an ostroum expressed by the help.
Although he reached 10 years of age and had not heard about David Youth, Kevern knew about jaze from a father's half secret collection of CDs.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eilin that Fats Waller was black.
Considering her age, she almost remembered the time when the pope songs were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
The Community was obedient, and this means that each of its sections agreed with thanks to those who had been judged with the principle of the group's prevention.
People of Afro-Karib origin on temperature and physical characteristics well understood for divorce and divorce - and they sing and flee.
Indostan's outcome, as if they were talenting from nature in all of the electronic cashs, were taking into account that no family remained without a worker phone.
What remained from the Poland diaspore was working in the sane-technical work; what remained from the Greek was the tarel.
Exiles from the Persian Lake and Levant, whose grandparents did not strive to leave the country when THAT, IF THE PROVISION, had occurred, feared that they would be accused of burning the flame, in fear, in particular saying that the flame would consume them, opened the restaurants with the labs and the cattles, and they were not exhausted and cut off.
Everyone by ability.
Since she had heard only the balls before, Eilin was hard to understand how about the words that Kevern had just spoken to her could be put on.
Music is the expression of love.
"They're actually not about the Property," said Kevern.
Except for people who have a big feet.
My father never told anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the running garden gave him an illusion of security.
No word could be passed through the sound isolation of giant papers similar to cave.
Aline didn't understand anyway.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say that it was a shit, but he didn't want to press two fingers on her mouth again.
She's already considered it strange.
"It seemed funny," he said instead.
She's unbelievable until she's closed Kever's review.
There was nothing throughout the world except the cave of its black-wheat.
Nothing he wants to look at.
"Well, if you say that," she said, staying at her opinion.
But that doesn't explain why you eat it to me.
She seemed really disappointed.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
I can't say, no.
The ships maybe almost...
And you're saying you hate me because my legs are too deep?
Did I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early.
"I like you just because you've got a stomach," he tried to say instead.
I've got such an extortion.
It sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
The trials of shaking often led him into anxiety because, like his father, he lacked the calm injury that could mix the cruelness of the shoes.
Maybe his father wanted to be violent.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to.
Although good eyes.
Aline Solomons rose up from the chessling, broke the console and smoke the wine that they drinked.
The wine from the bag, so the drinking couldn't serve him as a correction.
In her anxiety, she seemed to be driving like palm sheets in the uragan.
"And I like you just because you're stupid," she said...
Although you don't like it.
He was sorry for her and for the greater deepness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her view when she gave him a rebellion.
Did she think he would hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in a cold northern architecture where she was growing, but he didn't doubt that in the main parts she looked like a rain.
The same great ice ocean was broken on both of them.
The same faced with such men, even more feelings and caprize after that, IF THIS PROVISION FROM their forefathers, contrabandists and destructionlers, were shiped in anger from pab in pabs, ready to lift up the hand to any woman who was laughing to refuse or disappoint them.
You stupid?
They would have shown her a stupid bitch if she wasn't worthwhile!
The dream would be boiled by the most usual expression of the injury between man and woman; against the pressed ballades that the console had sent to kiss it and then to hit it.
More accurately, Kevern's opinion, because the kissing was already a fucking guilty.
Aline Solomonz's coast that he needs to leave.
He rose up from the cheeselon, as an old man.
She felt tough, but the weight of her worse surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the light.
They'd know each other.
She looks at how he goes, and out of the window, she looks like he goes, her partner is a man who has a burden on herself.
Adam, who left the garden, thought about it.
She felt compassionate with him and men, even though some of them had taken her hands on her.
The man who turned away from her with a sorrowful snake, confused, confused, all the ability to fight him - why did she think she knew that so well if she could not remember any case until today she had seen that?
Again, Ealyn Solomonz looked at his feet.
In the twenty years before the events described above, or about the Esme Nusbaum, a smart and energy-based 32-year investigation that worked in Offnau, the neof official control of the Community, prepared a small report on the preservation of low and medium-term violence in the parts of the country where it was expected to be reduced if it was not completely, taking into account the means and forces that had been granted to it.
"A lot has been done, and many things are done," she wrote, "to mix the expected aggressiveness of people who were fighting in thousands of wars, and won most of them, especially among these satted flows and rare divisions, where, despite the harvests of the churches, the breathing of the goodness of the churches was rarely feeling about the whole history.
However, some of the qualities appear that they are.
More than the spider seems to be, the lower of the things he produces.
The people slipped traps over sensible ballades, broke the stories of overcoming obstacles and announced its long faith in the well-being of marriage and family life, but not only the old deepness keeps its strong amount both in rural communities and in urban villages, but there are data that new and bad injury in homes, in slavery, in roads, and even in playplaces.
"You have a bad custom to write too much," said her scientist, reading the whole report.
I think you should read less romans.
Esme Nusbaum was missing.
I should also ask you: Are you atheist?
"I think it's not obligation to answer," Esme Nusbaum answered.
Are you lesbian?
Asme reacted on his right to private life and silence.
Feminist?
Now silence.
"I'm asking," Luther Rabinovic finally said, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbian or feminism.
We're not sure here.
We are society without prejudice.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and appealable, may sometimes deteriorate the results, such as what you showed me.
Obviously, you are the most prejudiced against the church and what you call "mal" and "brown", others would be interpreted as a expression of natural life and energy.
Continue to offer about what has been done, if it's been done, as if it happened, yesterday, it means to lose the country of its life force.
Esme Nusbaum looked on the sides while Rabinovic spoke.
His roses, like flamingo, repeated lightdiade letters, repeated the advice that "Ophnau" gave to the country in the last fourth century or more.
Smile your neighbor, appreciate your wife, listen to the ballades,• on the music, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, hear, agree, excuse.
The conversation is better silence, the word of song is better than the words written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you want to say," Esme Nusbaum replied quietly when she confirmed that her scientist's ruling has finished to say, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been treated so effectively as we're winning ourselves.
I'm worried that if we are not ready, we'll find that we repeat the mistakes that originally brought to that that which has been done, if it's done.
Only this time, we will cast out our anger and disbelief to others.
Luther Rabinovic joined the fingers in the piramid.
This gesture had to mean infinite patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "that is called "errors" of action that our grandparents did or did not.
You're going too far, and when you're talking about their wrath and disloyalty.
You should not need a person to remember that by understanding the past, we do not speak of "as" and "this".
There were no "we" and no other."
It was the time of the devil -- that's all we know.
"For which, if you are honest with yourself," Esme was encouraged to insert, "no one of the society can be justified well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what was done, it was done.
Then it was.
There's nothing to say anymore -- we're here.
And as we don't have to be guilty, we should not be justified if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why is the past, if not for learning?
The past is to forget him.
If I can add one word to this--
The Pyramidca Luther Rabbinova is broken down.
"I'll consider your report," he said leaveing it.
On the next day, on the road, it was broken by a moto, who went out on the trottoir, as described in the "worry of evil".
Coincidences occur.
The Army of Lesoto states that the turn is not a plan; the Prime Minister remains in South
The military representatives of Lesoto denied the preparation of a turn to the government's commitment by claiming that they were against the police that were suspicious to enhance political actors.
Premier Minister Thomas Tabane left the country by declared that the country ' s army was surrounded by its official residence and took Government's opinions at the capital of Maser.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the neighborhood of the South, stated that he had been threatened with temptation for his life.
The military representative of Major Ntlele Ntoi stated that there was actually no turn, but that the army reacted to the threats of the "political" policies, whom the police tried to invade.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Armed Powers Lesoto has taken measures by receiving several reports on the fact that among the police forces some elements are actually planning to promote some political, young political parties who were ready to build a chaos," he reported to the vote of America.
The representative of the South African Government of Clayson Mong said that military action was like a turnover.
"When no one has made a claim to take the authority by power, according to all information, the action of the forces of Lesoto has the main signs of the turn," he said.
The military representatives of Lesoto reported that the soldiers returned to the charm on Sunday and that it was quiet at the chair.
Meanwhile, Vice-Minister Motejoa Metsing managed by the Government in the absence of Taban.
Tabane said that it believed that attacks were subjected to the attempt to cope with corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesoto was completely stressed since June when Tabane stopped the Parliamentary sessions due to a divergence in its common government.
He stated that his actions were not violated by the Government, despite the reckoning in return.
Marko Van Ginkel's half defense will take a present season on the rights of the rent in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
21-year-old Netherlands will come to Italy in the next hour for medical investigation.

Production in the range of the lowest indicator in 13 months
The growth of production in the area was quiet until the lowest indicator of 13 months in August, according to the population of the investigation.
The latest value of the business activity index (MME) of the Markit production area has fallen to the note 50.7 in August from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates the growth.
The new orders were detained and undertakings suffered from the pressure between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
The values were made before the assembly of the Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The bank will wait for a clear plan to cope with the rest of the zone recovery and with a threat to deflate inflation, which consists of only 0.3%.
There is an assumption that the ECB-Ru Mario Dragy may later give the signs that he considers a quantity mixture scheme similar to those who have spent in the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than any growth, the efficacy of economic and geopolite insurance on producers becomes more evident," said the older economy Markit, Rob Dobson.
SMEs of Germany's productive sector, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, fell to the lowest than 11 months of comments 51.4.
However, in the second part of the economy of the block, France, the MMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause true concern as well as the weakness of Italy from stabilising to stagnation.
The marks that the impulse of growth of gas in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, does not add confidence, " said Mr. Dobson.
The delay of industry, most likely, will still increase oil in the fire to analytical analysis expecting to introduce additional monetary or budgetary stimulation.
One local news was from Ireland, where SMEs grew up to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight's main economy, said: "The best thing you can say about the August Business Activity Index of the Industrial Sector is that it shows that the sector is still.
He added: "The producers of the zones are obviously finding a very difficult life at this time, since the current growing geophylite stress - especially the Russia/Ukrainian - adds undetermined conditions still complex in many countries.
This increased tension, obviously, has hit the business - especially the consumer ' s confidence, and probably leads to some orders to be detained or even cancelled, especially major orders.
He said that "all more likes" that the ECB, of course, would have to make a variety of quantity of weight, "with a doubt that it would be possible."
Inhabitants of Mariupol will expose a street against the soldiers
In Mariupol was quiet before the week -- no one was struggling to organize the Mariupolis people's resistance, the city lived and worked on the Asian Sea.
Now the people with fear are waiting for the coming of the "folds".
According to Politologists, separatists are running to Mariupol to go to the Asian Sea - the city of Novoazsk has recently been taken, which had not yet been income of self-proclaimed replies.
The Mariopolis decided that the Ukrainian army would protect them, but it had a little power against extremely armed representatives of the DNA-LNR, and were gathered to help the military.
They're looking around, building blocks and strengthening.
On Saturday evening, a few thousand people came to the east border of the city, and they arose there in a pitch with the Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in the case of the situation.
The volunteers collect and carry up and carry out the dishes and products, collect medicines, issue the newspaper.
In the city, stores are gradually closed, banks and bankomates are stopped.
Ten years of cold for Beslan: Ten years of a worst school, like children who were in it, suffering
Ten years ago, more than 1000 people were taken in Chech warriors in the Beslan School, South Russia
More than 330 people, half of whom the children were killed during this three-day trial of the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who lied to death during the beast in school.
About 10 years after a terrible receipt of the Belanda school, 334 people died, including 186 children, herotic disasters warned about the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When terrorists, islamians, arrested and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new fourth, it seemed to be an extremely possible degree.
The tragedy united the east and the west in the reverse, which then marvelously increased into the future and hope of the greater distress.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan south of Russia to find some of the victims who lied to death during the beast at school.
We found wonderful young people who opposed evil, though the memories of terrorism will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that now disturbs Ukraine, where children like them are lost, will now stop.
A girl who is trying to go back to the shooting room
It was printed on the picture of the Russian Dmitria Belakov's photo when she tried to go back to the shooting hall after the mine's explosion.
Ida was desperately looking for her mother, Larisus, who now was 40.
There were fears that both of them were dead, but they were actually survived.
"The woman told me to flee from all powers, but I couldn't," said Ida.
My feet were covered with blood.
I got up and went back in to find my mother.
The soldiers chose her and took her to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely restored, but yesterday she said, "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I can need more operations.
There's a couple of shoes left in my knee.
Her goal is now to be a danist, to help people as the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed life, but she, of course, doesn't break it," she calls.
"This happened to me, and it was to change this fact.
Once a year, I'm always going to this elective room to remember all those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too much.
My best friend who had to become my classmates, Dera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and we thought we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I'll finish my teaching and start working.
I'll be under family later.
She says that the arrest remains with her, although the memories are a little sharp every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people from the United Kingdom and from all over here.
When I see on the Internet, where I go into the school window, I think many people will see it for the first time, know about our tragedy and do so that it doesn't happen anymore.
The boy running through the town of a powder, thinking his mother's dead
It was his first day at school (Russians begin to learn at school in 7 years) and survived three days of arrest, covering their mother Tamar.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mammy said to me to cure if he was explosed, and to keep her in his hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Return."
As he feared that she was dead, he fled and saw a crying little boy, and he had the baby for his hand and fled through the city of a poultry.
His father Vladimir, who put his son outside, said, "Damir said to me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamar went out for freedom and was in the hospital with noise on his feet, thinking that her son was dead.
After their reconciliation, she said, "I was crying out of joy.
I couldn't believe that.
He went in and covered me.
Damira later brought to London (now not-reporting news of the World), where he was recompensed as the Protector of Children from Barnardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Sheri.
"This fear comes back to you every day, but I would like to stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
Still, I can say he's in my memory.
I remember the fight after that, I put out all my game weapons.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and it's not a problem for me.
"I don't be afraid to return to that spectacular room, but I don't think of myself.
I remember the kids with whom I played in the court that didn't even choose.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they've stayed in the elective room.
I remember the driving in London so well, especially the game store, where I have been allowed to choose everything I want and to drive in the car with open ability.
But now he fears places such as Ukraine, where wars lead to a calamity that he and his friends have survived.
This fear comes back to you every day, but I would like to stop remembering him.
"I am so sorry for all those suffering from these terribles," said Damier, who was a volunteer in a woman's monastery last week.
That's how I want to help.
I want to serve in the police once and I hope that I will be counted in a school academy in the year.
His mother Tamar, 48 years old, said, "37 children were killed in our quarter, can you do yourself?
I remember the yellow silence after the arrest, but there were only no children who would cry and run around, and this silence continued for many months.
She's gonna remember her easily with Damire in London.
People in London wept when I told the story.
I realized that people at the other end of the earth could understand our feelings, and they could support them.
She was grateful to Sherry Blair and her fund for the reward and the opportunity to go to London on the east of 2004.
I'd like to call Sheri and just tell her that she's spent 10 years, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped Damire and me.
I remember when Damier wanted to eat a board, they called all the Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with officers in the restaurant, Damier shot them out of his water gun, and they fled and played with him.
And it's been a month after our cosmar then.
I was thinking that the British were so ready to share the pain and support us.
She said, "I think this world isn't better than these 10 years.
Now in Ukraine and war, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and they will be killed.
They're just the same children as ours.
I think for many people the war is a new report that they hear when they are stumbled or when they are busy.
I just know these people feel, fear of it.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so bad.
Damir has grown up and faced a very mild and quiet boy, he is not agressive and not bad.
He doesn't look for places, for example, he's not for this past cowmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they're going to a timely room and burning the lights there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it, and I remember how he was lying on the wheel, turning away from us for hours.
I didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he put out all his weapons and other military games, and now Damire 17, he's above me, sympathic, intelligent and healthy.
I'm trying to believe that a few hours I was so sure he died and that I'm never seeing him anymore.
When I was thrown up from the explosion and stood up on my feet, I looked at, and I saw parts of the body around me.
I was absolutely sure that it wasn't easy that my little boy might survive in this hell.
"I remember I'm crying to him, "Damir, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and fled.
So life continues to be for us, despite so many others.
Georgia Ilin, 17 years old
The boy whose shocking graph has been determined for the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: Beslan George Illin and his mother Fatima after arrest in 2004, and Georgia's case today
His blamed face was a print of fear when he was saved from death when the Czech terrorists shot his fellow classmates.
His graphy was one of the most shocking symbols of warfare in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54 years old, led him to school on the first day of training before taking the older son of Vladimir to the university.
"I left in two minutes before the terrorists entered the court, so my little boy remained one on three days of cosmar," she remembered.
Not alone, there was the family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only Georgia has survived.
The more closer to this date, the more difficult to think and talk about it.
There's no day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We haven't seen what it was a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time I have in my eyes.
No one will never forget, I promise you.
The graph of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking pictures of attack and was always increasing in sculpture (right)
I remember that George wanted to go to school on that day that he said he wanted to take a student.
I just knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
Now there's even a sculpture of Georgia weeping in San Marino.
Georgia doesn't like to look at this picture, and she's hidden in the bookshop we have home.
I understand, but I also believe that through this graph, people worldwide feel pain.
George says now, "It is important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never recognize the truth.
Now they're going to investigate this Boing broke in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what she was called?
This world and something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, no one wants war, as it happens?
Ten years are nothing for such a pain.
We need to go for decades to forget her a little.
She affected my health, and I still feel her.
About three or four years, I dreamed of cosmars because of the arrest, but now it's been better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was very careful every day.
I'm about my friends and colleagues who were killed.
That's why I continue to go to this elective room before 1 September.
I want to give the memory to my old friends.
I'm hard to enter the employment room, but I have to do that.
I don't feel a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget that, but I'm not trying to regret myself.
My life continues.
I went to school this year and went to the Medical University in Vladikakaza.
I'm gonna learn to become a cardiochirurg.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a military, but the health didn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for the country, but that won't happen.
Georgia Farneyev, 20 years old
The boy who survived, despite the foot of a terrorist killer
Incredible: Georgia Farney was at the feet of a terrorist killer during the arrest, but he could still survive.
When he was arrested, he was photographed in a employment room sitting near a bomb at the foot of a terrorist murderer.
Actually, it's a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We have said that it was still yesterday," says George, who wanted to learn at the Officer of Discovery at the FSB, but did not bear it because of the damage caused by his health during the arrest.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children are easy to cope with bad events -- I have to say that it's wrong.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, it was the first and last time I entered this spectacular hall again.
I lost my conscience.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show me where I was sitting on this picture.
Survival: Georgia Farneyov today with the phone graph of himself in the hospital after arrest
My pain is awesome, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
I'm healthy.
I need to be careful about the gentle that was hurt, but now I'm okay.
But the health did not allow me to learn at the FSB academy in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical conclusions, and they replied that it was not.
My second intention was animals, so I went to the veterinary institution.
I've been studying there two years.
He's learning to treat all animals from the cattle to the cattle.
He said, "I know that I will never tell my speech about my speech.
This is not what children should know, and of course not what they should survive.
His 42-year-old mother Marina said, "This pain never left me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes.
I'll go and attend the ceremonies that will be carried out to note it.
I know George doesn't eat.
For him she must be even more spectacular because he was there, and I don't.
I was waiting for him home and I couldn't help.
I'm so grateful that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgia is now adult, but this cosmar still with him.
It's hard to accept when something is so terrible injustice happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sport, but he can't work for them because of their gentlemen.
He had a few operations, he could walk, but he couldn't work.
I would say he's over 50% of the cosmar, but it's not absolutely to overcome and forget it.
This bitter experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed when they were arrested, and this only strengthens pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were my ways.
My son with me, and this is the best gift that God could do to me, but my heart is painful for those who were killed.
I know the family where new children were born, but I know the widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't.
I'm never gonna forget how the heart of an excitement was with me from my breast when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what happens in the world, wars in different regions.
Why are these people fighting?
Why are they killing one another?
War is very close to our country now, and I'm trying to believe that.
We were a friendly country in the past, how did we fight now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure a lot of children have already been killed in Ukraine, and many will be killed.
If you could take all the rebels and throw them out, it would be as far as possible.
Allena Ccaeva, 10 years old
The young man who has touched the safe place of the spectacle
Saved: Allenu Ccaeva is carrying a safe place in Russian speechnaza (left).
Now, she has ten (right) and she does not remember the wonderful crime.
The peace stopped breathing in 2004, when the small Allen was exhibited from a disturbed school in Beslan the Russian police.
The terrorists have released her, but they have severely abandoned her 30-year-old mother, Christian sister and Brother Mahar at the school room.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but the mother and sister of Allen died in a death fight.
Her father Russell was married again, and they and his new wife, Slana, have a little daughter, whom he called Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Allen, who now is ten, doesn't remember the capture and flow in a smart and life - pleasant girl, says neighbors.
"They are a great happy family now, and Allen and Mahar are both children," says a close friend.
Russian is a great father and wants to keep them far from all memories when the tenth anniversary is noted.
You may understand why.
Sindsy Kagawa, who returned from Manchester Younate to Burussia, noted that he was deceived when he was able to go back to the field in the form of the German club.
According to him, this transfer is a pleasant event in the career.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm going to play "Borusia" again, which brings the image of Kagava's words.
I feel very good.
Full of local emotions and awaiting when I can go out again in the "Borusia" field.
At the same time, Kagawa passed to "MUS" from Borussia in 2012 for 16 million.
However, he was not able to stand in the building of the English club by carrying only 38 balls in the England campaign at two seasons, killing 6 bottles and delivering 8 resulting transfers.
A man accused of a girl's preliminary transition "pelican" in Fayfe
The 78-year-old man will be presented before the court of charge for a three-year-old girl at the previous transition of the " pellican" to Fife.
Gordon Stuart prompted the girl to go to Pittonvine to East Newke.
The prosecutors claimed that Mr. Stuart had conducted his Audi Q3 without adequate care and care and took off the girl, which resulted in the trauma.
Stuart, 78 years old from A'A'ter, rejected his fault in the Sheriff Court of Dandy.
Sheriff, the king, appointed the date of the court on January.
Obama, Mercel and Holland are not open in Vladivostoke
The Duty Free Airport Magazine has made a table that prohibits the purchase of the worldwide political leaders in this magazine.
Don't reject them with spirits, waters, and horses.
The Magazine Administration decided that the President of the United States Barak Obama, the officer of Frg Ang, Mercel, President of France France Oland, Vitalia Clicko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and a few other companions could not be able to open with wood, coniach and spirits in their store.
And she cut the table on the door.
Earlier, Obama had been prohibited to appear in a more less accessible service of the Digital Office, which reported the company ' s site.
Whether the American Chairman of Meanwhile had ever been to eat in Russia's table diet, it was not worthwhile, but the prohibition authors apparently seem to be awkward.
Is there a sure after the bargo: Medvediv: Agricultural advice
The Russian Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev believes that, under the conditions of Bargo of Russian agraries, new technologies should be obtained in order to adjust the exhibition of the sugar-sized buyers.
The Council was given during the visit of the " Jugpticeprom" company "Agrocom ́x".
The Government's Chapter also repeat the Restaurants' advice to reorientate to the Russian meat which is a proper level.
Annual bargo for trade imports was introduced to Russia since 7 August.
The main trainer of the Russian College Valentine Maslakov is satisfied with the results of DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result in the lack of a targeted preparation.
Our sportsmen have spoken at their level, bringing "All sports" to the words of Maslakov.
Third place is under our sufficient high level of command.
It is pleased that the benefit of the French and even the Americans over us is a minimum.
We should consider that we were not prepared for this.
The season ended, and we didn't commit our leaders to participating in DecaNation's cat.
In the past years, we have become the second tour, but we have been renewed at this season.
In contrast, the French have issued a boesp team including 13 campaigns.
They did not hide their victory in this year, which they had many times declared publicly.
But even such a composite of households was not able to oppose the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians have spoken in such a good-level company.
But the results in some kinds were in order below than at the same Brilliant Ligue.
Season closed.
Of course, sports are no longer so important, more in order levels.
The main thing here was a place.
And the results of the gentlemen came to the absurdity when 1500 m men were so attracted by the tactical hitroplasms of running that showed the result of the average level of the female refugees.
4 suggestions to achieve better quality of subwater photos and videos
If you want to graph or video under water, you will have a whole number of device options before you.
The most basic option is the water-production "bottle", for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or exhne camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I made these photos at the family holiday with a number of machines, all about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, several rules must be observed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment again.
Even if you have a water broadcast camera, make sure the camera battery and other cameras are strictly closed.
Furthermore, set your camera for the type of graphics or videos you will take.
Some of the cameras have a summary or a type of object that optimize the exhibition for decayed underwater.
And before you get into the water, see how deep your equipment can go.
The cameras are calculated only for 5 feet, other than 50 or 60 feet.
See our guideline for the buyer and rating of digital cameras, both for traditional and water-free models.
Take a few pictures, because many of them are not getting.
The "speaks" has a CCD that will help you to make photos, while the camera is usually not.
Even if you have a CSD, it will be difficult to consider it under water, and the composition of the frame will be a accidental process.
So do some pictures.
Also, if your camera has a series of summary, which films a few frames with a few different exhibitions, take care of them.
Stay at the surface.
The quantity of the light is decreased earlier than you are deeper in the water.
If this is possible, stay at the surface when you film in the base, river or ocean.
This will also allow you to give more colors in the graphics; the deepest you will leave, the less colour you will see.
Float closer to the objects of the sums.
It is a great advice for dry suit, but it is still more important under water because of the flashed lights.
Especially important if you are filming on the camera: This device is often based on a fixed, wide angle line, which means that you need to draw close to the volume objects if you want to fill the frame.
The Brilliant Prize of the Olympian Games in 2012 on the Free Board of Bill Mahov can go to the Greek and Roman fight.
This was reported by the Master College of Dagestan on the Free War of Sajid Sajid.
The Specialist did not exclude the participation of sports at the peace campaigns in Tashkente in September 2014.
Bill Mahkov is currently located in the assembly of the "classics" team, "R-Sport" says Sajida Sajidova.
In fact, Bill was in both styles.
At the youth of the world in 2005, he was the winner of the village tourists and the third prize in Greek-Rimman ' s conferences and decided to end the free fight.
For a long time, the new stage of his career will lead to the Greek and Roman fight.
I'll say more, Mahkov can already speak on the world campaign in Tashkent if he wins a breakdown.
But the resolving word is always at the trainer stab in the head of Goga Koguashville.
Andrew Lawson was a person whose power of personality could enlarge all around, even in a huge organization such as the National Health Service.
Anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to the deliverance of disease and disease suffering, and from the pain of treatment.
Among those who turned to him, his wife reminds him of a MI-6 officer who had to live with disruptive consequences of torture.
Lawson realized that while the doctor had diagnosis and illness, those who were treating, mainly, worried about something else is pain.
Once in 2007, however, he became those who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like usually," he wrote in my last year.
I was hard to find power in me.
He's fighting the symptoms like the grip, he's discovering that he's disturbing his wife, Juliet.
"I want everything to happen faster than later," he said.
When Juliet went out for a week, Lawson discovered that he was unusual and unintelligent why he was disappointed.
Something was wrong.
He asked the colleague to make the breast cell rentgen.
Two weeks ago, he caught on the beaches in the French Alphas.
Rentgene's results came.
It was a mezotelome, unhealthy cancer that affects the powder, or a cow.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact reason.
Although some kidneys are infected with cancer, for example, not all because of the cancer of smoking.
But with the meatle otherwise.
Almost in all cases, the reason is to contact asbest, a volonic building material, which sometimes was called a miracle, but which, as now, is deadly dangerous.
For most of us, mesoteleom is a disease that can not be taken into account.
Asbest, finally, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbest is not used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial prohibition has entered into force.
Even when he was spending, only people of specific plants worked in close contact with him: tube isolators, builders, pillars and docks, for example.
Industrial is from another time, whether it seems to be a cause of anxiety today.
But such a calm is wrong.
Great Britain seems to be on the pike of the mezoteloom epidemic today.
There is more people died than any other country on the planet.
At an annual level, about 2500 persons, more than twice more people die from this disease than from car accidents.
Annual number of mezoteliums since 1980 and the prognosed number of in the future in Britain
The reason for which we feel his consequences now is that, although the use of asbest is contrary to law for many years (all types of asbest were finally prohibited by the law in 1999), mezotelome are usually decades of development.
And the attack of the mezoteloom is not a veteran, especially industrial construction.
Asbest was, and in many cases it remained in the house where we live, offices where we work, schools where we learn, and stores where we're going to purchase.
Consequently, mesotelome does not take attention to the class, the level of sufficientness, profession or age.
Bastions of appreciation, from modern London universities to private schools, as seemed to have no salvation.
The parliament has been dismissed by asbest.
Even hospitals intended to treat us were the reservators of this officer.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a tube isolator.
In particular, he had to think where he could contact an asbest.
Then he agreed.
"It seems that there could have been a lot of asbest in the Gay hospital, where I spent six years on the stage," he wrote.
All students, sisters, doctors, and lobsters used these tunnels.
Interestingly, how many of my brothers are sick with the same disease?
It was a question on which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"From the four doctors held in the Gay hospital and then developed a mesoteleum in the last five years," he noted in the letter in 2010, "I was one alive."
How many of us are sick of this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with "mezotelium" when he was 48 years old.
When he died, 17 February this year, he was 55.
To live so long is incredible.
Fifty percent of patients die in 8 months after diagnosis.
She's always awesome.
So now we can just ask Louson, "How many of us are sick of this same disease?"
According to Professor Julian Pito, the leading expert on mesoteleom in Britain, most likely assume that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbest epidemic in Britain must survive, about 90000 people will die.
Most people now do not imagine that they will die so.

The rapid review of the reports from the court rooms, where the suffering of frequently refers to compensation, shows how far it has been spread to the mezotelium attack.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Jenis Ellen was unexpectedly contacted with an asbest.
She worked on the network nine years, from 1978 to 1987, with two objects of clothing, one of whom was the main store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working in M&S.
Now she's two children older than 20 years old.
"Where it happened," she says, "I never heard of the mesotelome, I had a food about asbest.
I couldn't even come to me that it would touch me.
A few people really know much about asbest.
In particular, asbest is not one art, but a group of six minerals.
They received their name from the word "asbestiform", which means a volonic structure that reports them integrity and viability.
Of these six, three often used in building.
Chrisothyle, widely like a white asbest, is most often met in views for today.
He was spying in the blood panels, in the powder pills, in the termoisolation of tubes, in the cattle, even in the cocktails of cars.
It is less important than other forms of asbest, but it is recognised by the Russian union and the World Health Organization " a serious source of health damage" that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is a corn asbest (amaosite) and naked asbest (crokidolite).
Great Britain was ever the most important importer of the rain asbest in the world, and experts assume that "which is a reality, despite the indigenous idea that this is the fundamental cause of a very high number of diseases [UK]."
Marks & Spencer's co-operator has been affected by an asbest in the main company store at Oxford Street, London Alamy
Jenis Ellen may not think of herself as a typical victim of mesotheol, but Julian Pito's work is allowing her story to assume that her story is not very normal.
He conducted an investigation of sicknesses that allows to assume that "the percentage of the mezoters, when there is no effect on the area or home, were mostly caused by the effects of asbest from the environment."
The majority of this effect, he says, is "common use and weather effect" for our opinions.
No one can't be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, in which the Westminster court was discussed, demonstrates how people, even in the central of the Government, could be affected inconsciently.
In 2009 Goddard reported that the technical shifts and trumpets outside the parliamental committees were infected by asbest, which could have caused a voloon to move something so unnecessary as "the air flows".
The members of the Parliament are often accused that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it is true inverse.
Although the Directive on the Technical Service of the Parliament stated that the Westminster court had received " pure sanitary testimony", she now recognized that it was necessary to work for £1 billion per the river of the parliament, enhanced electricity and removed asbest, and that after the general elections of 2015, members of the parliament may have been sitting at the QE2 Conference near, not at Westminster's Green Steps.
The Goddard report noted that "the situation with asbest was not governed in different rules".
You can't find out whether the management error would be worth life.
Everything you can do now is waiting.
One of those who couldn't find their contact with the asbest is Grem Abbo, a general doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbo, 50 years old, he suspects that he has been affected by an asbest when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital, which has been successfully pronounced with asbest," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
So hard to remember all the places I worked and dates.
That he recalls clearly, this is the day on the beginning of December 2009 when he hit something like the gripper.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation at the late evening.
I suddenly started to disappoint me.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrified.
I think I can't move all the way home.
As a doctor, Abo knew that the pain and illness of the throat were around the rocks.
But as Jenis Ellen, he had no reason to suspiciously suspicious.
Finally, he couldn't walk for a month.
The responsible doctors made rentgeneal photographs of the breast cell and placed cateters in order to remove the weight from the weight and send it to the analysis.
Yet, he remained without diagnosis.
He gradually improved the health, and he returned to it.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he worked hard and breathed.
In 2011, one of the Ebbots patients came to him with similar symptoms, and then he had been diagnosed with "mezotelium".
However, even then, Abo did not connect it to his own case.
Finally, his patient was decades older and worked with asbest.
The connection in this case was evident.
In September 2011, with Abbott, he again was deteriorated, and the doctor who consulted it showed its results of the CAT and the Renting Photographs of a group of specialists.
In December 2011, just after two years after Abo began to feel bad, the sensor, equipped with the camera, was introduced into the field between the row of his neck cell and the row of his easily.
I'm optimist.
I'm usually just going further," he says.
I didn't care about it, honestly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy came on the week between Christmas and the New Year: "I said it was mesotelome."
Grem Abbo: diagnosed mesoteleum
Abo suddenly met Macmillan sisters, one of whom he was invited to join a lawyer.
That's exactly when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It seems that the asbest was widely exposed, especially in large public opinions, where the asbest termization was quite often at the tubes," he says.
People who have been affected by asbest in these opinions are now sick of this disease.
Thus, mesotelome is now affecting younger people's untypical professions.
The most dangerous isolated asbest of tubes in hospitals were located in the pools, so it is not likely to suffer patients.
However, many of the tonnels that are about to come from one opinion to another (like Andrew Lowson) or eat in double tables (as Grem Abo often did) were almost sure that the effect of the art was actually affected.
During a few decades after the war, hospitals have been a place where, theoretically, they have saved life for patients, but the place that threatened life for doctors who had been treated.
He's still being removed today.
Schoolers set their bones on asbest bases
And it's not just a hospital.
Asbest was often spending in offices, magazines, libraries and marbles because of its wonderful isolation and fireful characteristics.
Schools too.
In particular, many, mostly, were first subject to the effect of the asbest in the class.
Throughout the country, in a number of lessons of chemicals, Schoolers set their bounds on asbest bases.
The web sites focused on the problem of asbest in schools.
At the same time, in our homes, such incredible things as a flash or a cover of saraw, as usually contained asbest.
"This is the industrial ice based on a large number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lousson in the case against the Gay hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could remember was the shadow of the garden in the 1970s.
Therefore, be steadfast, wear gardens.
The effect of diagnosis, when the disease is unhealthy, is great.
"To understand this, it's gone enough time," Grem Abbo said.
I came back and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I tried the surgery two weeks.
Then I realized that I had to go and understand.
Well, I'm not going to meet Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult issues was a transition from the doctor's opinion to the patient's situation.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he remembers how the amount of information that was to be accepted.
"It was difficult to understand everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long have I?"
They gave me about 12 months.
I remember how I thought, "What, I'm not going to meet Christmas anymore.
That's all."
Mezotelome is particularly dangerous, since the mechanism of our life supports, is the act of breathing, is the cause of cancer that kills.
Most of the cases are contacted with asbest.
Asbest consists of the cross-flakes.
When the asbest is disrupted and the wolves are breathing, they can be thrown into the woods, the rock of the rocks.
Astronomical asbests are injured and can cause mutation of cells.
"Problem occurs because of the breathing of an asbest bullets," Professor Tom Trager, a cardiao-rocal chirurg, who came to the Gay hospital in 2001.
It's the hospital where, as Andrew Lowson was suspicious, he has been affected by the asbest, now, by the ironing of the judgment leading center for the treatment of the mezotelium.
Trager knew Louson and healed some others who probably had been influenced by staging in the hospital.
When the jars of asbest fall into the tissues, Treager says, "the breathes them on the area where the area is located.
This is, in fact, an invasive process from the beginning.
The normal treatment of other forms of cancer is much less effective in the mezoteolome.
The efficiency of the surgery will be involved, for example, causes warm disputes.
Some people think that it should be trying.
Trager's not.
"It's not worth cutting the cup," he says.
It can't be able to join her knife around.
Meanwhile, this cancer "is not very good for chemotherapy," which "actes" but doesn't treat.
"The time is from time to time because it's a long time," says Trager.
But finally, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients will have much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Guld died 20 years after the diagnosis was diagnosed.
Two and half years after diagnosis, Grem Ebo continues to fight.
After he had been sick, Abbott met Andrew Lowson, who, after four years of diagnosis, became unified to the Office of support and advice for the same diseases.
"Hallo, the Central Cancer," he said lively when they called.
"He was very local," says Abbo.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he is still very powerful.
Sna_ Abbott has offered six pieces of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life every month.
"I was in desperation," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "which was trying to give all a few more local ornaments."
After meeting several specialists, Abo decided to continue treatment with Professor Loik Lang Lazunski, professor of the toracical surgery at the Gay hospital.
"We had the privilege that I didn't need direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," Grem admits.
The patient ' s medianist would have to receive direction and approval.
The money plays a decisive role for patients with meatle to get the best types of treatment.
However, when such treatment is ineffective, many are still in a financial way for anxiety - the future of the families they will leave.
And then they are addressed to the courts of compensation.
Andrew Lowson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse .P.
"The asbest was for health since 1898," Morgan said.
But what changed in the 1960s, that's what happened to understand that even very small numbers could risk health.
That's exactly what the company's consciousness was discussed.
Andrew Lowson and the Gay hospital finally resolved the case, but it was not "resolution for fully valuable", as Morgan said, since Lousson did not prove unlikely that his mezotheol was the result of contact with the asbest in the Gay hospital.
After his death investigation, the representative of the Gay hospital, however, confirmed that "the depth in the double places of the facts had been removed in the 1990s."
It was too slow for Andrew Lousson.
How to Remove the Assemble
In particular, associating a mortal contact with asbest to one company or work - usually a decade after this - has been a big problem for patients with a mezoteal that require compensation.
Many of them would have changed the owner or closed.
Fear archives could be lost.
And those who are protected from the ships know that at their side, of course, no.
In response to this year, serious new laws have been issued, which facilitate the injury with the mezoteal process of recovery, even if it had not been possible to investigate them.
In this law, a £350 million funds established by the insurance industry for those who have been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but who are not to judge.
In such cases, 80 per cent of the amount that the court could normally condemn for compensation is about 120000 pounds.
About 300 successful requests on this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, as many who are working with mezolean diseases, believes that £350 million are "very good" for the insurance industry.
"This is a transaction written by insurance ensurers," he states that the amount consists of the fourth of what the insurers should be paid if it had not interfered with a period of time and because they would find the company and give the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, a former minister of work and pension, admitted that the law was "incomplete".
However, Penning and Morgan recognize that when seven people die every day, they needed to be faster.
"The people suffer so much, and they need help today," Penning said during the second reading of Bill on the mezotel in December last year.
By that time, Grem Abbo was in the hands of Professor Lock Lang Lazunski for 19 months.
After the initial consultations of Langz-Lazunski, the chirurg recommended that the surgery be involved, which, despite Tom Trager, he considers effective.
This resulted in radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lung Lazunski could have a total of 40 per cent of survivals in five years.
Abo's feeling that the force was appealing.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbo.
You see this all the time in patients.
There's some power that supports you.
When you get up, you can get very quick.
Grem Abo for Oper in March 2012.
At the end of August, he ended the last of six of the chemotherapy.
The following scan has not shown any disease track.
Then I was scanned in March [2014).
There were a few five [cancs] in my breast cell.
I just had to do 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abo's passed through six pieces of chemotherapy.
Now there's no trace of bullets.
However, this process was physically and emotionally difficult.
You may think of practical things -- about when I'm dead, for example, or what I need to show the wife how the timer works on a baller.
When you get bad news, you become unpleasant.
We need to look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Themzin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a illness, which means I wouldn't live up to my age.
They reacted very differently.
The Tamsin is very common and energy.
She's racing to all her friends, and we've been calling a lot quickly.
Ellie was more stuck.
She didn't talk much.
Such conversations are something to do with all the painful cancer.
However, such discussions are not equivalent to the hope, even the difficult opportunity to survive.
This disease brings a dark determination (a.k., finally, for Steven Jay Gulda).
As Andrew Morgan says, "mezotelium is not a threat to life.
The bodies of the amazed Pharaohs are rotated into asbest tissues.
Asbests are used to strengthen the castle and increase the heat.
The elder is described asbest.
It's now obtained a floor that's not exploded.
I've seen the salpets made of him in the rocks on the bankets.
The modern commercial use of asbest begins in Italy, where it is used to produce papers (a.k. banknotes) and tissues.
Great asbest shadows are opened in Canada and Southern and then in America, Italy and Russia.
This is the ideal temperature for couple engines and industrial revolution turbine.
The world production of asbest is more than 30,000 tons per year.
Prudential statistics show the preliminary ability of those who work with asbest and whose consequences have been rejected in life insurance.
Nelly Carshaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook testifies that the parts of the asbest in her "revealed out of doubts, the main cause of death."
It's the first case of this type.
Carshoo, Turner Bros Asbestos, does not recognize responsibility.
Compensation is not paid.
During the Second World War, advertising is intensely developed, one of the most deadly dangerous professionals in view of asbest.
Voluntary industrial prohibition for the import of deep asbest
The Appeal Court confirms the first successful request for health caused by asbest contact in Britain.
The global asbest production grows up to 4213000 tonnes per year.
Great Britain imports 139000 tonnes.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in Britain requires licence for all asbest employees.
Imports and uses of dumb and corn asbest are prohibited by law in the United Kingdom.
All use of asbest is prohibited in Britain.
The Act on Mezotelome has been adopted in Britain.
The compensation scheme of £350 million has been declared.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but the white asbest is still used in raw building materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at approximately 2 million tonnes per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose the rues of the people; protesters are swearing to recompense
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong electors to move candidates to the election of 2017, despite the democracy requirement of reform.
This is, mostly, the beginning of the long promised protests in Hong Kong's business quarter, since the activists started planning and ®iz in the time of the statement.
The decision of the University Assembly of People Representatives, in fact, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates that are not loyal to Peking.
"It has not deceived our expectations, but it still brings anger," said the law of Emily Law, the president of the Democracy party.
That's not what Pekin promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And apparently we have an issue of authoritary regime.
Protecting China's decision, Le Fay, Vice-Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the University of People's Representatives of the University, said that allowing the international exhibition for the elections of Hong Kong's rue would be too chaotic.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom has delivered control over Hong Kong back to China, Pekin has promised to allow the people of the region to choose by voting by the Government head from 2017.
The Chinese rulers have made a decision as a democracy step forward on Sunday, since it gives the гонkongs the right to direct vote; however, it also makes clear that the Chinese rulers continue to keep the process strong in their hands with the Commission for the Deployment of candidates, which is strictly controlled from the Peking.
And, in the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision was taken after the summer when some of the most scales had occurred and received a broad announcement of protests in Hong Kong for many years.
Most of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which has been threatened by the organizers to cross the Hong Kong financial area if the Peking does not guarantee the current general electoral right.
On Sunday evening, a few hours after the statement, hundreds of Occupy Central parties gathered under the rain before the Hungarian Government.
In demonstration, organizers claimed that their movement was going to a new stage of civil failure and that they would rise on the protest walls in the following weeks.
However, they did not report the detail, obviously, in trying to avoid problems with the governmental bodies.
In the online discovery, the organizers reported that the movement " was the only way to take the central area as an exceptional measure, which could be taken only if all the options of the dialogue were disappeared and there was no other choice.
We deeply note that today all the opportunities for the dialogue are unexpected and the central area will certainly occur.
State bodies in Hong Kong prepared for the statement of Peking for a few days, and on Sunday, in the State Apartment, security measures were strengthened by police and barricade.
Based on demons, many in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control over their own city.
The degree of the inhabitants with material strengthens competition in the field of goods and services.
Furthermore, fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of words, begin to be under increased pressure from Peking.
They criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations are undergoing the risk of business, the source of life force of Hong Kong.
"The claim they are talking about can lead to a big economic damage depending on how much and how long a person will participate," said Regina Ip, which has been criticising the movement for a long time.
We don't want anxiety that Hong Kong is out of control.
It's a presentation that is for investment.
Chinese State SMEs also reported in the last days in which the Hong Kong activists were shown by the diversities governed by the Western States.
In this year, the Neof-References on Electoral Rights, which reached 780000 participants - more than one five of Hong Kong electors.
And in July, tens of thousands passed on one of the greatest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The American Culture of Educational Challenges has reached the University: The prime tourists have proposed to come on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to such a question by launching the first in Britain a "Lux" category travel service for current students.
In order to put a clear impression on the arrival to the University, the company also will provide transport options such as a personal aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P.
Mr. Stuart also stated that the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually need to carry their things throughout the country to a dangerous car.
In accordance with our new options for VIF, we are deeply waiting for helping students this year to reach the university with a minimum effort and a nice rate.
The representative of the company reported that, since this service was just running, the orders have not yet been made, he added that "the students will begin to offer this service for a few weeks."
The company also stated that, despite the need for the students to have 9000 £ per year, it hopes to find a market for this service.
Today's students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in expectations and hopes: more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it needs for.
However, the National Union of Students has discovered that service as a rejected from reality.
Megan Dann, Vice-President of the Higher Education, said: "This project is incrediblely rejected from the life of most students.
Many students, who will begin learning at the university this month, have a crisis in life valuation when the available financial support in the form of credits and credits does not work for the expenditure of the basic needs before they can begin to think about to get thousands of pounds for some kind of simple arrival in the community.
Feminists raised the issue of racial pertinence and behavior after Ferguson
The safe growth was killed by the police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, this month ago.
The coming ones lift up their hands, scandering, "Do not shoot up," while they wait in front of the sepulchre.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, who killed a safe growth of Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoil Press noted that he was moved in the Internet talk among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists, who remained in comments, set a gender above racial pertinence when it was about the circulation of reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, as the Middle-West pressure has increased and has attached national attention, Press has seen the responses of white women, which were 100 per cent of racial adherence.
In comparison with the reaction of black women after the death of August 9, similar ases with the titles such as "the thoughts of Ferguson from white woman" and "the feminism" were not only about women's affliction.
But they demonstrated a move for Perce.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people talking about the white skin and the privileges of such a high level," she said.
People feel needed to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic for the crisis we faced, and because (the situation in Ferjuson) is so connected to raciality, they feel that it is necessary to indicate.
For a professor of English at the University of Ohio Coritia Mitchell Ferguson, Mitchell Ferjuson has dealt with the problems with which the American black-shirts are differed every day but are not considered as " Women's problems" in cultural field.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's happening to me and my partner, and I'll get 150 sticks over here," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how the colored people are attacked in their own country, silence listens.
"Why are women safe to speak about public, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, who studied race, gender and sexuality in the United States history, there is no diomomy between racial and gender issues.
From its point of view, black women are in that position to clearly divide these issues; they are in a complex reality every day.
While white women now address racial and gender issues in the feminist management, Angela Hatter, professor of women and gender research at George Mason's University, says that their preliminaries were in contrast.
"Manual 1865 and 1890, at least 10000 black men, and almost always served the violence of a white woman," race Hetter.
There was a white woman who confirmed the story to make the linen.
From the point of view of Hatter, a break between white and black women occurred when white suffragists, for example, Susan B. Anthony studied the situation at the end of the 1800s and saw that the fight against electoral right would only be effective for one of the groups: women or black.
"They decided to put all eggs into the right of vote for women, and the right of vote for black boys had to come later," race.
The view of such things gives us a clear idea why color women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women had received vote right in 1920, there were ten years to join white women against linching in Association for prevention of linching.
The group appeared almost 40 years after the first request of the black women, said Mitchell.
Mitchell's view of the reactions of white feminists to the problems raised in Ferguson - the behaviour of the police, the racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to " breathe" the problems of the women's blackness in several generations.
"Well, it would be great if activists who have such [traditional feministic] ideology would have severely affected the right to educate a child as they relate to the right to contraception?", asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second whales, who have made careers to fight reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, now begin to understand what this means.
The known white activist of Gloria Stainny's feminist movement after two weeks after Michael Brown ' s murder was exposed to Facebook and up-to-date the article of the Guardian Rebecca Carroll colonist, which required white Americans to participate more in the protests on racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the risk of the body - and the view of racial problems that are strictly different in public investigations - will be in the head of the change, " wrote Stain.
Although Stanyam is deemed to be more crossing feminism, which includes the problems of raciality, and the gender, its comments on race in America have been made to some of them.
Researchs of the American Institute of Christin Somers, author "Who stole feminism?", said She The People that young men in the United States, especially young people, "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but the comments on Ferguson are contrary to the criticism she said earlier.
Now we have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but nearly nothing for boys.
However, when the White House has recently started a small program, "My brother's Watch", to help vulnerable black and spanish people, the wrath of many feminists, including Gloria Stain.
Police with the black community is not the only problem that moves a transitional line of traditional feminism.
After the United States border service arrested approximately 63,000 non-satisfactory years without attending the south-west border of the country this year, the immigration re-employed to the surface -- this time as a woman ' s problem.
Andréa Mercado, co-president We Belong Together, who supports women in immigration reform, said that she had only to share the history of immigrant women in order to deal with this problem as important for women.
"They're talking for themselves," said Mercado.
When most of the slaves are exposed to [immigrants], women who come with them are in a position that is vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"There is a response in women's organizations," she said.
The Ipswich house is selling "with Swine"
The photograph of the house made for sale in Saffolke was removed by agents of immobility when it showed that there was a large wheat in the holiday.
The sale of £12,0000, a house with one room is on the private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was different from the holiday graph of the house, on which the swimming swimming was drawn up.
The Con ́s Inmobility Agency reported that the swine on the graph is a home favorite owner of the household.
"In the same way, the graphy was placed for a mistake and has already been removed," reported the representative of the company.
In a detailed description of the house, Con ́s described the former house of meetings as "uniculal house with one room".
Though the Agency has removed the graph of its website, it is still maintained in advertising materials.
The sale of the house was interested in the networks where some asked whether the sugar was sold together with the house.
The Russian tennisist Maria Sharapova, in the fourth circle of the US Open, Caroline Voznacki, believes that she doesn't have enough stability.
According to the sportsman, she wants to end the year worthly and try to go out to a new level, which transfers from New York Basiley OSIPOV.
How do you generally have your results on the "Big Sleam" tours this year?
Of course, I'm glad you could win Rolan Harros.
As a result of three other tourists, I had no stability, especially at the end of some cats.
Now, of course, I'm disappointed.
I couldn't even get to the quarter.
What tasks do you put before the end of the season?
After injury, I have a huge motivation to get out at a new level.
I have what to work on, and I'm going to do everything I can to finish the year worthwhile.
Asian tournament series begins a few weeks ago.
The member of the Committee on Fisheries of the Cultural, Youth and Affairs of the Early World Champion Nikolai Valuev proposed to carry out norms of the GTO in order to provide bonuses in the course of the world.
According to his statement, the general standards will be the same as in the Soviet times, that people will provide standards for training, running and other practices.
At the same time, 12 Russian subjects will begin to introduce the GTO standards on their territory from 1 September.
I also set up the students who had set up the GTO to give bonuses when they were in the gate, " stated Baluev.
For example, they can add a little balls to the EEA.
There are also proposals to give additional outcome to enterprises that have been tested.
In Harvey in South Wales, a new millioner has been found after winning in a lottery
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
There is a search for a new billion in the south-west of Perta, where one happiness for a house will be nearly $1,1 million with a lottery breakfast on Saturday evening.
The hostel kiosk in Harvey brings gold to the second price in five years, the last winning of $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner must still declare himself.
The owner of Steve Forward said that the victory was called an ageotage in the small city to the southwest of Perta.
The whole city is talking about it, and it's all excited.
We thought that winning could be secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia have spent the winning of the main price last month, noting the end of several successful weeks for the players of the State.
Last week, a player from Canning Way is one of the five billion Augusts, after a huge $7.5 million winning from Belmont for a few weeks before.
The winning couple has played for twenty years and has reported that the winning has given them the opportunity to travel throughout the world and buy a new house.

Mineconnovation wants to increase the market in electricity
On this week, the Minecon-Environment will introduce the Government a comprehensive ecologically clean transport development plan in Russia, reported to the Department of the Ministry of Oleg Pludjans on the round table, which carried "Science" on Moscow Car Salon - 2014.
The plan is set up on the Government ' s mandate, one of the main objectives is reducing gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September, at the beginning of October, as stated by the Prosecutors, the proposed measures are electro- and hybrids - the development of vehicles on the gas-motor heat plans in Russia already exist.
The plan (copy in the " Knowledge") was calculated for 2014-2017.
Electric and hybrid transport criteria should be held once and decide how to stimulate the use and production of ecologically clean vehicles.
The report to the Government, in which tax and taxable measures for electronic transport support, will be prepared for December 2014; the credit credit scheme and liability scheme will be reached until April 2015; and the proposals for reducing the price of cars, the localisation and the establishment of service infrastructure will be decreased until October 2015.
In 2014-2015, amendments to normative and legal acts should be made to facilitate the conditions for the construction of the ship infrastructure (in parkings, auto-contracts and other).
In addition, the Federal Factory was to formulate proposals for the regional authorities during 2015 to stimulate the use of environmentally clean transport - in the form of the benefits of the movement and parking, for example, and for February 2016, and for the extension of such transport gains.
Finally, the Mineconomist Development will introduce a series of indicators of the activities of the regional authorities of the criteria that reflect the effectiveness of the production of environmentally clean transport, the development of ship infrastructure.
The electricity market in Russia was sold by approximately 100 electrons in 2013.
At the beginning of 2014, the import rental for electricity was revoked, so sales constitute approximately 500 pieces, and the main executive director Mitsubishi Motors in Russia Andrey Pankov.
However, five times the growth does not make the electricity a few notes: in 2013, the Association of Peace was sold by 2.78 million light and commercial cars.
Until Russia’s electricity only imports Mitsubishi Motors.
Initial imports are prepared for Renault - the company is primarily oriented on corporate customers, says Renault's planning and partnerships in Russia Nikola Remise.
However, most other transport electricity producers took an expectative position towards Russia.
Once the electricity is available, the Russian producers also have "," GAZ, "", but the mixture.
For example, in January - July 2014, "AsM-Holding", "AutoWAZ" issued 30 electrons.
A little question because of a road-effective electricity, admits the "AutoWAZ" director of Sergei Amanov's engineering, without the support of breaking in this segment....
The development of the Russian market electrically other than road vehicles (the electricity sold in Russia, the average two-way analogues with internal burning engines) maintains the inequality of the carrier infrastructure (instead, units), the director of the "Autostate" Sergei Celicov.
As a result of the roads and low levels of self-reduction of electricity in the nearly 3-4 years, the Russian market is still a lower segment, the main editor of the Author Michael Traveljanski, which is agreed with Celliko.
Manufacturers say, rather, that some models of electricity are close to the cost of normals.
The Russian market has electrically good perceptives, primarily to universal the confidence in consumers that "electricity" is real; this will, in particular, contribute to the presentation of all new charges, underlines the President of the BMW Group in Russia Walfgang Slimma.
Such infrastructure projects are, for example, the "Rossettes" gateway: a few in Moscow are built, there will be some 80.
The negotiations on network building are held with other regions.
According to the Director of the Department of Russia, Vladimir Sofina, the company believes in the market of electricity and is ready to build a plan throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electricity in the country and a lack of a single standard for the loading of electricity by different brans.
Moreover, "Rossettes" as a network company does not have the right to carry out electricity sales, it is trying to do this for the load of electricity.
Pankov considers the most effective market support in Russia as the electrical renewal of the rental.
The nul rate will be held until the end of 2014, the possibility of its prolongation, the extension of the billion.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environmental (the idea is discussed and cashed by all cars) will also support the market, but it is not as sensitive as well as the preferences are considered, Penkov.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, for example, from Norway, where the reduction of tax has resulted in a rare increase in electricity sales -- now 12 per cent of the market.
Russia also needs to stimulate measures for automotives, such as free parking in the centre of the city (as already been done in Moscow), certain Pankov, or the possibility of removing electricity on age, which is not yet in Russia.

Army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Praut (right) appointed the Defence Minister of Wongsuwan Right (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chan-Ocha, announced the establishment of a new Office of Ministers of the country in which more than three of the generals or generals are debt.
The military representatives received key posts: Defence Ministers, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministers.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Ocha was official at the premises of the Prime Minister after the official approval of King Thailand to appoint the head of the temporary military government to this post.
The 60-year-old military capturing authority in the country as a result of a bloodless turn on 22 May was the only candidate to the Premier Post.
He was elected by the Prime Minister at the Parliament's meeting.
Earlier, the army appointed the deputats of the parliament.
According to Prauta Chan-Ocha, the conversion was the only way to maintain stability.
He had previously been demonstrated in the past half-year demonstrations in which protestants had required the Government of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinavat.
Officially Prauit Chan-Ocha will be a temporary premium, since military plans are to make general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that wars are trying to strengthen their authority in the country.
Wars came to the authority of May 22
on the background of the full parallel of the civil authority.
The leaders of the main political parties were undertaken to temporarily arrest.
Once the military entry to the authorities, they have undergone a temporary arrest of the country ' s leading policies, including the Prime Minister of Jinglyk Chinavat.
Some journalists and public participants were also arrested.
The current political crisis is running from roots in 2006 when the army mixed with the office of the Prime Minister of Brother Yinglik Chinavat Taxi.
They both use the population of the farmer, especially in the northern regions of the country, which sometimes had succeeded in choices.
However, many representatives of the Mediterranean Class and the staff elitis have entered an anti-governmental movement that has practically paralyzed the country since November 2013.
Nobody said it would be better in the media salad, I promised you not to find an officer from the new Palm browser.
It must be formally admitted that it is actually so, but it is still increasing.
Because everyone knows that we're saying "Belgia" -- we're using media, we're saying "midia" -- we're "Belgia".
Restaurants like deeply to say that the success of the admission depends on three factors: location, location and location again.
There are places that are resolved not to be good, but even good, but somewhat inappropriate.
Shortly, when I felt behind the Palm capital, I remembered that there was sometimes a "Grodock" coffee here (in respect of the same television, then "Odesa-mama", and also the "God" restaurant and the Beer "Free".
Now it's beer, but it's no longer the nodalgic-soviet but the Belgian.
On the ground, only the issberg arrow was placed: the bar steel and a couple of chairs, and the rest of the space is not even the sunlight.
So it's fun, like in the coma: red, yellow and green walls, different colored stones, instead of televisions where the Russians fly.
The Belgian reports in Petersburg haven't been in the news for a long time, so compare with what.
There are eight species of beer driving (260-300 rubbles per 0.5 l) and an innumerable bottle (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive officer is a pleasant presentation of the menu, reporting that "midians are great seeds", and it should be noted that the service, despite the failure, is the most part of Palm.
The menu is expected for contents, but often very unexpectedly.
Well, for example, it is noted that the meat roulette with the Vallon black (280 rubles) is actually a carpet that is so tired that the pergament paper, compared to it, will show the material increasingly stupid.
It's at least a funny thing, but it's just if you're throwing up the semi-case together.
It's worse with salts.
The classic league (260) would be the most regularly recognizing crime against the Belgian people: a swimming issberg that was ever opened a long-term cart, a chenical fassil, covered by the bacon chips, and something married.
You don't want to meet anybody with such a league salat!
The ingredients of the Belgian salat were partly other, but the impression was also not positive.
If on the unseen quarters of pomidors of shirts or fired champions were still able to close the eyes, why the media look like they have been comforted and opened for their life?
Because I already know, there's a full standard of white morning media!
They are understood in the "some for your choice" shoes (490-560 rubles at 0.5 kg).
Susov's half age, the one of the white wine, the soldier, and the morrows, was not clearly given.
There are weapons, and there is no aroma, whether there was wine there, and it was a mystery.
That's why good people trust the media of freeth with a home majonese.
The fucking water here is not a bullet that goes up to that degree that, depending on your mind, you can decide, the first or second food before you, but just a pleasant bullet.
It was stated that the cocktail was prepared in the beer suit, and nothing was said about the rosmarine.
At the time of the situation on the diameterly opposite: Rosmarine has deployed everything.
It was impressive that this cocktail had been fed with only rosmarin coasts, which had so unrequired aroma of meat.
But it was noticeful to the feet of the cow -- no, it was just a disgusting crack in a caramelise.
Palm waves are not only sweet but also soft with bovine, bubble, or becon and syre (220-280).
The clone sows became extremely aquatic, and the vaffles were dropped.
But the manager was very informally interested in the pressure of the board.
So we should come again.
The dollar curses were higher than 37 rolls in the news on the westly prepared new sanctions for Russia.
It's a new historical record.
The $10.29 tomorrow has grown on 26.9 cups and has made 37.02 rubbers, and the rate has risen to 30 cups - to 48.73 rubbers, testifying the data of the Moscow Birge.
The balanced waste increased by 28 cups to the previous closing level and was 42.28 rubber.
The dollar reached the crime events on 19 February 2009 - then he was 36.43 rubbles, and on 3 March 2014 he was already 37.005 rubbles.
On the night on August 29, the White House reported that the President of the United States Barak Obama and the German officer Ang; Mercel discussed the possibility of further sanctions against Russia.
It is a long-term character, a couple of dollars, and a couple of dollars.
The long-term prognoses suggested this mark, says Anna Bodrova's senior analytical.
Everything that is with Ukraine will be reflected in courses.
Until this will continue, investors will respond.
Today, the audience of the invasion of the army is not under any side, but the market has become very emotional.
All of the facts that he was sustained to such news were remarked yesterday.
The week, according to the prognoses of the specialist, will close around these levels -- 36.90 and 37.05 bullets per dollar.
The tax period ended, prices for oil, policy, sanctions, gas transition problem through Ukraine -- all this is the one-cotch covering.
The inflation inflation is also prognosed: to the current prices for ashes is added from 5 to 10 per cent.
Moreover, seasonal fruits and f’s fruits will be completed and will have a vacuum until the network is reoriented on other suppliers.
"Dollar came to the marking in 37 rubles, passed it and returned, no powerful issue," comments the leader of the "Broker Opening" Constantin Bushuev market analysis.
They will continue to see whether the promised sanctions will be introduced on the Sabbath.
Rubble, according to his statement, was quickly weak after the end of the tax season, then the news went to Ukraine, and the BC last week said that it was completely over to the floating course until the end of the year and refused of any monetary intervention.
If you look at the daily round, it was nothing different from those previously in this month, all feared the marking of 37 rubles, the analysis continues.
So, there was nothing powerful in the road.
The feeding periods for the currency market were, for the end of January, when an increased question on the currency and the third March when the CB was charged with a recording number of currency.
The UFSs also see the local side of the weakening of the roof.
First of all, this is an increase in the income part of the budget from export operations, as well as the increase in competition in internal producers on the basis of import relief, says the UFS IC Alexy Kozlov main analysis.
Importing goods and services can be brought to negative moments.
Rigorous Russian currency decreases significantly the investment in the Russian economy, the growth of inflation pressure, and, as a result, becomes the cause of the insurance of money, which, in turn, disturbs the development of the country's economy.
If we talk about the market of action, the estimation of the rubber will cover a few reductions in the rubber.
For example, the MVB Index on Wednesday was decreased by 1.67% and the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
The so-called difference in the decrease of index is explained by the deterioration of the rubber for more than 1.5 per cent during the day.
Emotional characteristics of the rubber are affected and is explained by the mass effort to buy a currency.
As indicated in the case of a person, emotional feelings are not decreased, and the rubber boxes are partly or fully restored the lost positions.
"We think we can see the ratio of dollars and Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," says Alexius Kozlov.
Genetal inflammation is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she had spent many years, thinking that she would die after the wrong diagnosis.
Carin Rogers spent most of her adult age, thinking she remained alive only for a few years after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charco-Mary-Tut disease (SHMT) - a group of inheritance injuries that lead to the injury of the nerves without the brain and the clothing.
The CMT UK has reported that the wrong diagnosis is a common problem among the people with the SMT because it is so little about this situation.
Approximately 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are supposed to have a SMT that can cause engine symptoms such as mouse abilities, uncertain walks and feet fingers.
Because they may feel disappointment or pain, and it does not treat and progress, which means that symptoms are strengthened with time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she had suffered from the attitude of Fridray (AF) - with the predict that was very bad for.
Rogers thought she would be touched to an invalid chair until she was 18, and she would die before she was 30.
The mother of two children now 51 said, "I knew that I couldn't do what others did.
I fell every day, and I had more time for everything.
I couldn't get on the rolls or squeetboards with other children, and I had a lot of shit at school because I was running and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations to free the hile-likeness and cut off a hundred, she looked at the medical card when her doctor came out of the comma, and it was written that she had AF.
"I felt myself guilty because she was cut down the nose where it was not, and therefore I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, found information about this situation in the library and wrote in the Association AF," she said.
When I received information in response, I was overwhelmed and tried the most terrible panic than it was.
I thought I'd be in the invalid chair at 18 and I'd die before I was 25, and I'd gradually lose all my abilities in this interval.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that until she was 17 years old, she realized that her ability to walk was not so damaged as she thought and asked her doctor about it.
He just rose up and covered me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this sickness, because you'd already be in the invalid chair."
I think you have something that represents a much less threat to life.
After several genetic investigations, she found SHT.
"When he explained what it was, I thought I had taken a happy ticket," she said.
The Great Britain's favorable SMT has announced a month of information about the SMT to try with the attention of this disease.
The tax burden on Washington's enterprises shall be as soon as the economic recovery is replaced.
Resisting economy means more clients, more sales and new workplaces.
This also means higher taxes.
The payment of taxes on the state and at the level of companies throughout the country has increased moderately in the past year when the economy has been restored, according to the new investigation held last week, and the companies in Washington are not exceptional.
Companys in the area, Maryland and Virginia totally paid $27.6 billion in the state and at the financial level of 2013, by 3.8 per cent over $26.6 billion in 2012.
The tax burden on State and the level of business last year increased by 4.3 per cent, up to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year ago, and it was the third range of growth after the next year when the accounts were decreased in 2009 and 2010.
The taxes taken by the State increased faster, 4.3 per cent than taxes, 3.9 per cent, under the investigation carried out by the company for service professionals, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Affairs Centre, the Tax Policy Group.
More than the half of the tax income in the area, 56 per cent, are taxed on enterprises, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax income is in the company.
The Virginia, with 28 per cent, brings the lowest amount of tax income, proportionally from enterprises.
Increasing tax income increases resulting from the remaining level of inevitability of companies, researchers say that in the year following three years, the increase was reduced by 3.7 per cent in the year when the growth was reduced by less than 1 per cent.
While a large share of these income is in large states such as California, New York and Tegas, the same happens in Washington.
Companys in the area, Maryland and Virginia totally paid $10 billion for state insurance and at the level last year, $9,6 billion more than in 2012, with 4.2 per cent, compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, the return of prices to insurance does not have any similar effect on the growth of State tax income and at the level of Maryland, where feed insurance taxes exceed one fifth tax accounts of companies.
Virginia and the Columbia Circle Company pay about half state tax accounts and in the form of insurance taxes.
"What happens in Maryland is that the majority of their inevitability, especially the tax base around the Columbia Circle, belongs to the government or non-Communities, which will not pay taxes to insurance," said Duglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland must be much more reliable, for example, to pay the same services in other states.
Recent growth of tax income from enterprises is to completely explain the renewable market.
The income of enterprises seems to be adjusted by these data.
Companys in the region declared a corporate state-level tax of $2,3 billion, more than $2,1 billion than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income income tax, mostly in the region.
Although trends are addressed in one direction, the tax burden of enterprises at the level is not increased by the same speed at all three levels.
The level of growth in Colombia was at the same level as the average country, 4.3 per cent, while growth in Maryland was faster, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia has observed the amount of tax income below the average of 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia was the lowest corporate tax of three jurisprudencies (in each of which the same corporate rate) of 6 per cent.
The corporate rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent, while in the area it is strictly high to 9.975 per cent.
Seemingly, the United States Trade Palace had shown that in Virginia there are taxes below for State and at the level of enterprises and, in general, a more favourable climate in the case of taxes for undertakers than in Maryland.
The survey has not been evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia has experienced competitive pressure from its neighbor from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed a legal act that reduces the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent per year.
If the State continues to achieve the objectives of tax contributions in the year of the year, this law would be able to provide a tax rate for enterprises even to 3 per cent by 2017.
However, the small business in Washington seems to feel better and thus pays more taxes for the state and at the level of recent investigation.
The taxes for enterprises payed in the form of individual taxes by small business owners are a transitional structure for which the majority of small enterprises, in Colombia, Maryland and Virginia, increased by 20 per cent last year to $2,4 billion, with a much greater speed than taxes for enterprises in total.
Researchers say that the trend and increased income from business taxes throughout the country, mostly, will be maintained in this year, in the case of trade taxes in State governments and at a level increased by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014, compared to the same period of the past year.
However, the Washington area can be lost, since the reduction of federal costs is indicated on the labour market in the region.
The Brunzal Age of Russian and Judea
The householder of the world campaign through Judah offered to Russia two silver and seven bronze wages.
Only the main favour of Japan's assembly was the result of this indicator.

This is how the individual part of the world ' s priority has been completed.
The last day of the tournament in Chelabinske, on Sunday, the calls of world campaigns were played in orders.
Both Russian collectors, both male and female, were one of the main candidates for the reward, but, as in individual associations, the representatives of the sex did not have happiness until the medals were not reached.
And here the Russian Jewish guests won the order of silver.
In the resolving opposite, they took the main favors of Japan's team in the opposite fight against account 2-3.
The assembly of Russia conducted 2-0 after the pure winning of Han-Magomedov and the wild, Denise Jarceva (weight to § kg).
However, in more difficult weight category with their Japanian opponents, Mourat Habikiros (81), Magomed Magomed (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100).
Similarly, the scenario was developed in a female tourist, where the Russian assembly was 2-0.

The Russian team was then only three medals - one silver and two browns.
The current tournament was lost by the Olympical Champions of Arsen Galstan and Mansuer of Isaiah.
Of course, we're all big ma'ma.
Yeah, I want gold medals.

Joan Riverz's family hopes for the best
Joan Riverz is unconscious of the arrival to the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter has expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian actor will be corrected from sickness.
"Thank you for your continuous love and support," Melissa Riverz said in the statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived to Mount Sinai hospital on Thursday after an extraordinary call about her heart residue in the Clinics at the East Side, Yorkville Endoscope, reported sources.
Doctors keep it under drugs and strictly observed until they are satisfied with the " weighty" remaining.
The answer was a wide range of support on the Internet from such as Donald Tromp, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
All of the figs of the kings
In the sale of the debit album of the Royal Blood group, the new hope of the British Year resulting from the rock duetes from the clubs with a premium to the stadium.
Duet Royal Blood is a year on the scene, but has already a name for a BBC premium, a tour at the Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the New York Concert of Jimmy Paige.
Their single named album received 100 thousand orders in a few months before the reception, and the contract on its release is located in the portfolio of Major Leebla Warner Music.
Taking into account the current weeping situation on the strict market, the situation is outside because it is not about the new Lane Del Ray or a generally sweet representative of the new R'n'B, but about the duetes of britains playing with the level of volume and intensity that was last in the mode a few decades ago.
In general, the rate of the first album in relation to all the above-mentioned circumstances was particularly high and already justified.
Duet had not seen a name that could be reached before that the hair metalists were totally desperate, and the blood of the kings run as they had in their dwellings is also understandable.
Of course, primarily about the heroes of the past Led Zeppelin: as well as the big quarter, Royal Blood is putting their goal to enlarge the blood of the British Year by bringing it to the new height.
Prognoses about the success of this undertaking, please, are vulnerable, but something is already possible.
A tenth of songs, which has been placed in thirty-small minutes, is not a demonstration of the fenomenal donation as a confidential and powerful declaration on the fenomenal provision.
The dignity of the department numbers, it is to refuse: for example, the "Out Of The Black" pilot song is characteristic of not the melody of the line, but the barbarian party.
The musicians say that this song is easier to sing than to sing.
It is also worth selecting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing plastic "Better Strangers" composition with a shexpire quotation in the heading.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will be nicely sounding at the holiday of the lovers of a heavy year, but when playing, they get into a more or less single floor.
And it's not obliged to be bad, even the opposite.
Force Royal Blood is that they don't claim on the Law of the new Lennon and Cardneys (the more they're moving in Mo'head captives), but have brought many rockduetes out of the ghetto India clubs.
They are, despite some differences created for stadiums, in a place less than a few thousand people, obviously hard.
The secret of partial use of the base, replaced by the gitarr in the normal format imagined at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
However, the case is not only in instruments but also in the way to make songs.
Headers of the zero retrovocates with great difficulty were chosen for some of the postmodernist paradigms, with a huge neo, to recognize themselves not only by epigons, but by self-sustained creative units.
The Royal Blood now sounds so powerful and hard that this effort has successfully drafted some severity and solidity of the material.
Well, finally, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twi for $1,04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what he reported on Friday morning: Online store and video manufacturer, and hundreds of other things, buying a Twi video playing service for $1,04 billion ($US970 million).
This news about surprise is not because no one expected that Twi would be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be buyer.
Three months ago the Twi's video service of Google for a good look of liar is completely ready, and this compound seemed natural.
Twi, last three years ago as Justin.tv, aims to be a real service of general character - YouTube version in real time.
Instead, he was quickly converted into a form where the gayers translated their internal games; "YouTube for games in real time", according to Business Insider.
Interface Twi.
And "let's play", a genre of video rolls, in which all knowing are giving (in particular, old) games about the games, such as the "Thantic Theatre", are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when they describe Twi; so the news that YouTube obtains Twi has been met without interest, a classic example of a technological company who is borrowing a potential competitor.
This is a secret why YouTube negotiation was lost, taking into account that, according to the information, he was ready to make less than Amazon.
All we have at present is a statement from the Executive Director Twi: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term objectives, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, honestly, is an incredible success of Twi.
Snobs like me, who claim that they will be better working than looking at him, have difficulted to understand the attitude of looking at games rather than to take a Joystick in the hands.
One thing is looking through the bedroom of the friend at 3 morning when it is running through the Resident Evil, and all other things -- seeing how a foreign person gets 20 shoots in the Call of Duty.
All the games you could look right now.
Another problem is that many of the most people of today's games are counted on one person, so looking at them without self-controlling the angle of the view may be a recept of the pain worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speed transitions in which the Bennisters of our Electronic Age ended up the entire games for recording periods have been diluted.
But if it's not about the game or humor virtue, it's not likely that its Twi's channel would be interesting.
But what do skeptics know like me?
Twi has 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is a fourth source of pick-up internet traffic.
How does Amazon do this?
It's hard to put Twi into the Amazon Instant Video as well as YouTube could simply blow Twi.
However, Twi has something that would be pleased with any company: this is the young men who are disputing about.
According to Chapter Twi, Shir, Amazon and Twi, "the two believe in the future games", and this channel does not give signs of imagination, even -- as a visionary kind of a person.
As a result, more than 330 people died in 2004, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were hurt.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
The survivors - almost all students - with the dead parents - the town of the Angels - Ramón Caspolat, the head of the Susan Dodia's Committee, who participated in special operation by MCS - tells the Correspondent of the "Community" of Elizabeth Anton's working on the spectacular project.
After returning to Moscow, they met Aslambec Aslahan, who was 10 years ago president of North Kawkas, and negotiated with terrorists, as well as the Officer of the FSB of Russia Viceславe Bochar.
I was particularly concerned about the work of this subject is that in Beslan there were no ten years.
This issue is extremely painful for all who have some attitude to it, people are hardly agreed to speak about what happened.
The impressions of the poetry are very hard.
But forget Beslan, and I hope we have done our tasks," Antonov said.
The Spec Project is prepared by the Rambler & Co Holding information study that works in a company from the weight of this year.

UNDP on the carrying of a small distance racket

Deputats proposed the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
In the case of success of the initiative, the Russian data will keep on the servers after 1 January 2015
A draft law for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Russian personal data law already adopted, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is placed on the basis of the legislation of the underground hall.
Her authors expressed the deputats of the Hosdam Wadim Dingin, Jaroslav Nilov (LDR), the Federal Guinea ("Single Russia"), the Vladimir Parachin ("Russia's Justice") and Alexander Yuchanko (KPRF).
Such changes, according to the initiative authors, will contribute to more operational and effective ensuring the rights of the RF citizens to preserve personal data and to keep the secret of the transmission in the telecommunication networks.
The Law, which the parliamentary entry into force, commits to keep the information of the Russians processed via the Internet on the RF person's territory.
It also commits records, systematics, collection, storage, accuracy, and from the personal data of RF citizens, in the databases distributed in Russia, as well as information on the distribution of such databases.
Furthermore, the Law provides the Court ' s right to enable the Court ' s decision to access information processed with violation of the RF personal data law.
The Law also provides the establishment of such "black lists" sites - an auto-issued "Recorder of the Rights of Personal Data Subjects".
This law was adopted by the House for a summer.
The authors of the law project expressed Andrew Lugo and Wadim Dingyn from the LDR and Alexander Yujonko from the CCPF.
Finance and Southenko are also one of the authors of the current legislation on the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who don't have the date in the RF must be acquired
In commenting to the draft legislation in the GOSMA at this day, Leonid Levin stated that he did not see the issue of transmission of the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to his statement, those companies who will not have their own personal data stocks at RF by 1 January 2015 will be able to acquire them, for example, "Rosselcoma", who repeatedly said that they were ready to provide their servers in the arrangement and already provide their servers, in the Mail Group, in western companies, which are already delivering their servers today."
"There are also several independent dates that are ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If the company decides to carry out the law and continue to work on the RF territory, I don't see any problems -- they will get technology opportunities for allocation," Levin said.
Different legislative draft
After the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association is concerned that, in the case of the adoption of the Law, the Russian draft will no longer be able to serve many global network services.
In particular, on the online broadcasting services of aircraft and hotels.
According to the Association, "the law lost personal data subjects - the citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to distribute their own data emperously by determining that their records, systemifications, etc. should only be provided in the databases based on the Russian Federation territory."
The RAEC statement emphasizes that the establishment of the user ' s information mechanism would be more effective about the systeming of its personal data.
In this case, it will be able to choose the territory on which the measures are to be carried out.
The adoption of such "localisation" legislation in other countries led to global services and economic losses.

Russia remains in the right to take responsible measures aimed at protecting its legal interests in the introduction of new antirosion sanctions, reports MED RF.
The Russian External Diplomate of Awareness states that the "conclusions" of the Council on 30 August demonstrated the failure of Member States of the EU to overcome the inheritance of unspecific support by the Kiev authorities.

Heavy ways to record at university teachers
As the valuation of university teachers for many students exceeds $1000 per year, the Me° Shroder, quickly forwarding for the second course, has made a nice way to reduce expenses.
He repeatedly set up the system of advancement of books to the senior students, making them a nominal compensation in order to reject their sale.
"My mathematical analysis library, which usually costs $180, got for $10 and the "Chick-fil-A", says Schroder, 19 years of learning at Covenant College in Georgia.
The needed literature for the past seat would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Council of College, a medium-statistic student will take over $1200 per year for teachers and teachers, but the students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are still electing Internet stores and creative ideas similar to Shroder's system.
The books are become more popular, allowing students to make a book during the semester, and they are often covered by a damage than their purchase.
The Nibo Incorporate Company, which belongs to more than 250 universities of booking magazines, reports that the volume of books has grown twice since 2011.
Adults have been studied that approximately four books at University Book Magazines were taken during the past workshop, says Vice-President Nibo Trevor Mayer.
Less than half of all books are obtained at University Book Magazines, the Professional Unit of the National Association of University Magazines.
This is the input course in the best way to make a good deal.
Buy in the Internet store
Sometimes, if you go to the Internet, the price for a new book can be one third of what you will see at the University Book Magazine.
The nineth of Ron Larson's Mathemate, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hosteller are about $290 per pre-score, but a new emission can be obtained for $239,99 on the Chegg.com website, which is specialized for sale of teachers.
Buy of the holder
If you're not contrary to strange marks or hurt, the teachers keep a good option.
"Matematical analysis" is sold for $93.49 in a contained form of Chegg.com.
Me_ Casedy, 25 years old student of the fourth course at the Brig-Yang University, says that he paid 42 cents for the exhibition of the Media Strategic Decisions: Comprehension of the Business Party.
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Brissi, director of the "Colege without walls" at the University of Massachusetts in Emherste, want students to identify their teachers, whether to have previous publications.
Sometimes updates are not eligible for jobs.
In such cases, old issues can often be found for a very small share of the cost of the last issue.

Putin declared the full inefficiency of the Near East Development Fund
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin reported at the meeting on the support of priority investment projects and territories on the Nether East that the budgetary investment of the Development Development Fund, two years ago, reported ineffectively to the Interfax.
"15 billion rubles remained on the depths," stressed the president.
At the meeting, the Chairman of the State ordered the overseer of the areas of surrounding development at the Mount-East.
He said that the draft law necessary for the creation of TORs should be introduced into the House.
The Federal assembly noted that until 1 July, the terms of the areas of surrounding development at the remote East and their criteria were not confirmed.
Vladimir Putin also made the main tasks for the development of the Near East.
Among them, increasing the transportability of the region, reducing the infrastructure of tourisms - both on the internal market and for the development of exports.
Furthermore, it is necessary to establish proposals for additional investments in the region, and to develop the areas of sustainable development, which must be competitive to the key business centres of the ATR, the President stressed.
In the previous report, it was reported that the territory of surrounding development could be replaced by the OECD.
Why "The Watching of the Gala" couldn't save cash collections
"Silvester Stallone 3 has returned less than $30 million of its 90 million budget in the United States, while "The town of sins: a woman for which it should be killed" has only returned $12 million of its $70 million.
"Home video" with Cameron Diaz was only $14.6 million in the first outcome, while films such as "How to offer dracon 2" are also disappointed by the deception.
The article of the Telegraph Robby Collins shows that when talking about films may be bad as films.
Collin called the "best" year 2014 in the whole history of the casinos films, and called "How to assign the dracon 2" eda "functioning" to the fantasy.
However, when a few more older films and films are addressed to the audience, it seems that the problem is not obliged to be a movie.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average estimates of CinemaScore and Metacritic of each movie that passed on the summer at least 2000 copies between the holiday of memory on May 20 July, 2013 and this year.
Results that take account of the opinion of cinema and cinemacrits are allowed to assume that the movies of this year are like the calibre of the past year.
The commentators assume that the case may be in the change of view habits and the current popularity of the Internet services such as Netflix.
Regissor John Fairo, who currently works on the quick outcome of the design film "Jungly Book" said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the time is changed."
We must admit that and not try to follow what was before.
Despite the current fall of cash collections in Hollywood, Netflix has reached $1.2 billion, almost two more than $837 million last year.
Last year, register Stephen Spilberg has discovered the study because they are too trusted in the comics franchises, and he prophesyed "good" Hollywood.
In the light of the present fall, some commentators claim that there was a share of truth in its dark predicts.
As a result of a number of potential cash hits in 2015, including "Ery Altrons, Minions" and "Your Park", other representatives of the cinema industry are more optimistic.
Simon Kingberg has recently called the fall of Cass assemblies just "equivocal", said Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the most cash summer in the history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions are not afraid of the owners of coastal and middle Asian food, but for restaurants of the Spain and Japanese kitchen, Russian suppliers are a dream.
In general, it is preferred to replace the imports prohibited by products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There's a small-sool guarder than a bad mozarel," the Italian Restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio's head covered by the behavior of the quality of sugars, which providers will be replaced by the Italian.
Mozarella and the bullet sure ended in the restaurant first, and they have a little time to keep.
Parmeza's stocks must be enough for a few months.
What are you doing?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was on the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes the eyes that clearly: shocking memories do not let him go to this pool.
The meat was on the halls of 30 centimeters from the floor!
There's a cat!
Cross!
Then I said we would never buy anything for our restaurant on Russian markets.
I don't know maybe it's changed now.
But in the days, I was brought to a fish test from the Mount East.
That's what she's talking about!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio Wood is that many things are usual for Italy for the Russian producer in the wild.
A few years ago, I had to buy a Russian garbage.
In Italy, meat is in the 10-day cold camera at 1-2 degree temperature.
It must be high to become mild to make the mouse loss.
I've done all this with a stumble.
Then they asked me, "Where did you take such an unclean meat?"
I said, "That's yours, Russian!
Why don't you do that?
In five minutes, Barlotti's holiday in the French restaurant "Brasserie Most" on the kitchen will have a stap-list in which there are no products: French ostriches, seafood.
The Chairman of the Restaurant of Brasserie Most and Bar "Stree" Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: France's whistlers have already replaced with Tunis, and instead of French syres the Restaurant will buy Swiss.
Nevertheless, and Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The color capus is 200 rubles!
I'm asking, "Why is it so worth it?"
They answer me, "Well, we have to do it too."
But this cup shouldn't be worth 80 rubles!
We're buying the long-east wheat, but they're 15-20 years old, you imagine how weighing their pocket?
The price is that it's superdelecate.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources for foreign vessels.
Standard history: "The first three months everything was good, then the quality was quickly fallen."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot hold staff and calibre.
Many restaurants of the kitchen don't know what will be with them when the stocks are finished

Sanction Menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed the order for the application of the department of economic measures to ensure Russia ' s security, which are called main product sanctions.
The country is prohibited to import ova, sweet, meat and subproducts from the domestic birds, meat delicates, fish, molecules, milk, yogurtes, yogurtes, vegetables, fruits, f^tees, orees, colbases and sugars are prohibited.
Restaurants started a cheker with suppliers: the prices for products were grown, and they needed to look for similarities from other countries.
The most important is that in the dear restaurants from France, Italy, Spain, where the products were put up in the "materin" countries.
The company had to be renewed earlier.
For example, when Rosselhosannadzor was prohibited by the import of Australian bovine and the previous year of American and Canadian meat.
The suppliers were replaced by the supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
However, the sanctions of the year-2014 have become much more serious.
True, the 20 August Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev approved amendments to the Chairman's order, which lead from the prohibition of the boys' atlantics and forels, lactic milk, seed cartoon, sugar sugar, horse and bowl for seed.
The Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can still be mixed.
Until the part of the restaurants exists in undetermined conditions.
According to the Company of Eastern West, one of the largest HoReCa suppliers, the portion of import products in the primary segment was up to 70 per cent.
"The dear restaurants will have to change the menu under the production of farmers and other countries," says Sergei Miranov, restaurant, the owner of the RestConsalt Agency.
If the boss is →, it will not be a problem for him.
Only we have a little bit of this, and once a new menu can go for two or three months.
The trigel from the "Brasserie Most" restaurant will be ready for this: rejecting will be from 10-15% pairs, half of the menu is to repeat.
In restaurants with a mixed kitchen, they have already started to replace feeds, such as a stack from a marmor bullet, on befstrogans, says Sergey Miranov.
"Oxan Glybchuk is replaced by Russian, Belarus sirams, Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, which is a representative of the "West-West" company.
Slives and milk production from Others have similarities in Russia and Belarus.
A curriculum from the United States can be replaced by a smoke from Russia and Belarus, a seam of Norway, a seventh, a foral from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of fruit and f’s production can be compensated for the production of parental producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
Myronov considers that the budgetary network restaurants will be easier than the primary segment: the gurmans that are capable of distinguishing the Italian mozarel from Russian.
Although Ginza Project is difficult, he considers it.
Ginza Project has several decades of restaurants under different branches and with its menus.
In replacement, a lot of time," says Mironov.
The comments were refused in Ginza, sent to the lack of owners in the country.
The owners of the Kazakh and Mediterranean Coffee underline that products from the Soviet Resps would be more aromatic
But there are many restaurants whose sanctions are almost not too touched.
They are related to the cooking of the CNS countries: the Portuguese, the Uzbek, the Armenian and the Azerbaijan.
"In the busy kitchen there are no precious products," says Hatuna Colbay, the owner of Saperavi and the coffee, "Way Me!".
All of the syringes for us are in Russia, based on many birds, smoke-film, exotic green we don't use."
In Colbai's records, they haven't taken any food from the menu.
Timor Lanski, the owner of Chihona N1 restaurants with the Uzbek kitchen, also doesn't disturb the sanctions: he only needs to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia is importing from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, it will be a profit for us than imports from the country, says he.
The CNS can be obtained from the extract, the lamb, the lamb, the poisons, the bullets, the f^tes.
In the middle of Asia, it is much better than the "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Of the Uzbek pomedors, everyone knows that they're cool, sweet.
Nobody's talking about the Spanish.
After the sanctions were introduced, the representative of Minselvodhoza Uzbekistan Olimby Artiko said that it was planning to increase the export of fruitproducts to Russia two to 2016.
About the time after the introduction of sanctions, Belarus and Kazakhstan were declared to replace the imports of Pee to Russia.
The Restaurants of the Fastfood, who responded to the Demand of the Finance, are also quite quietly responding to the sanctions.
Press service McDonald's stated that the location exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdan, the Department of Subway Russia's suppliers, bought about 80 per cent of network products in Russia, although there may be temporary complications with the supply of fruit and increased prices for meat products produced from import series.
In " Germany " sanction products" there were not more than 4 per cent.
They haven't touched the sanctions and the Walker's laptop.
KFC, Burger King and "Small Cards" have not answered on "Money", but other market participants claim that Burger King's localisation is less than McDonald's.
Without the Norwegian fish, restaurants are ready to buy more Chinese than Russian distant-east
On his bowl
As long as the restaurants complain that the price demand is increased, even on the product.
"The prices for "Grabley" were grown in average of 10 to 15 per cent, for the Italian restaurant "Cherry Mio" -- twice," says the restaurant Roman Naznikski.
Even in the Business restaurants, the self-sufficiency of food grows in 5-10 per cent, admits Colombia.
"East-West" does not refuse, "for example, the Belarus milk production was 10-15 per cent from August beginning."
"Brasilian suppliers raised prices for nearly twice, " complained Sergey Rak, Director-General Stardogs.
The short smoke was 35 per cent.
We're waiting for China's prices, maybe they're going to lose the heat Brazilians.
In the nearby time in Stardogs, a planning increase of prices will be 8%.
Now and so, it's very unnecessary to raise prices, says Cank.
According to statistics, the growth of the public departure for the second quarter of 2014 was only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest indicator after 2010.
The different prices will continue to grow, but it is unexpected: until most restaurants have been reserved products for the next two months in the hope of overcoming purchasing prices.
But what's going on in two months, no one's going to be.
In front of Moscow Mary, there are ten ten trees decorated by green and tree.
In the center of the scene, the walls are playing.
It's a festival of regional products called "There's time."
"We've been going to make a feast of food for a long time, and here we've been a sanction, we've been organized, a festival," says one of the organizers.
In the scene with the Greek bathroom Anastas prepares a salat from macarons and household conferences, there was a master-class for the preparation of a bathroom with caramilised eggs.
All of the Russian products are assured by organizers.
In the tabernacles there is an exposure to the achievement of the Russian People's Mastership.
Meat from Basquiria, olive from Salehard, fruits of the Sowhoza named Lenina's powder of the Italian Jay Clous.
"Lusy for restaurants can be replaced quietly by another fishing fishing from the Mount East," says the owner of the fishing ship "Your people" Philip Galkin.
We're catching the heart, the cat, the kitchen, the bowl, the cheese, the king's lobster.
Yeah, they're not like the Norwegian wheat, because it's a wild fish.
The Norwegian race is the same aquaculture.
You're taking him into your hands, he's not even going to shoot.
And you will not keep our distant-east walls in your hands.
Only the claims without claims are replaced by the Italian Mocerel
In the whirlwind of his tent, there are beds with the Magadan birds, trees, holes, muxons, mediums with Crime, a greenhouse from the East.
Galkin's sure it's time to go to fish from the Mount East.
According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 is more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish is going to Japan, Korea and even in the United States.
Fisheries imports in 2013 are approximately 800 thousand tons.
Since 2012, its people have been working, selling fish through the Internet store, until the application of sanctions has served a half of the decades of restaurants, such as "Plean Things".
A request has been made to Galkina from 15 restaurants.
The same drought can be done from our fish, he's warm.
We were tired, trying different recepts.
Now we're selling the dry on the Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish was spent a few times, and the delivery was 15 robles per kilogram.
I'm ready to get the Philadelphia portion with a cate in the Galkins tent.
Despite the roles of the seventh, these must be longer lived, but the knowledge of our fatherly fish is being forced.
There are even roles from the hall and the sea eye on the "Your People" site.
In sushi-barah, truly, the substitution of the Norwegian cow is preferred by the Chile.
Gallkin explains this by making new recepts with a far-east fishing recept.
"The Russian suppliers' fish have not yet been for us," explains Killfish Bar Dmitriy's owner.
Similarly the same situation, and with other products: Russian producers could take the freedom, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and owner of the LavkaLavka Boriss Aquinov project, you can now speak more about the replacement of imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are major transnational corporations with powerful logistics and large amounts.
They are able to replace the prohibited imports quickly from our farmers.
"It means that the prohibition is primarily won by major producers of other countries," says Aquim.
However, in the last month, the restaurant growth has received a more anxiety signal than product sanctions.
Three McDonald's businesses in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ecaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We examine the court of the claims made for the definition of restaurants for the most opening of visitors," the "Money" stated in McDonald's press service.
No one really understands what's going on.
If all are being carried out by product sanctions, this is one option that can be survived - says in the conditions of an anonimity of the company in the Restaurant Consultation.
If they start closing McDonald's throughout the country, the scenario will be fully different.
"Europrotokoll" instead of GBD's help
Casco payments can be received without the GBD, so CB, to stimulate the introduction of the Euro Protocol in Russia.
The Russian Bank has repeatedly offered a draft guidelines that will be able to carry out without GIDD from 1 September this year.
Really, and only on the cases when the appeal was formulated by the "euro protocol" without the participation of the road police.
I mean, if only two cars were involved in the DTP, there were no physical damage to persons, the damage is not exceeding the fixed limit, and both drivers have agreed on who the offender was.
Since August 2, the " euro protocol" payment is 50 thousand rubs, and from 1 October in Moscow, Sankt Petersburg, and in Moscow and Leningrad areas it will be increased to 400 thousand rubs.
It is that even in small damage, in the situation when the DTP can be formulated by the " euro protocol", the drivers who are in the air are invoked to DPS.
Because, when the police had been able to get a refund on it without the GBD.
The options set out in the draft indication are called to eliminate this obstacle to the introduction of the Euro Protocol in Russia.
According to them, the casco payment of the DTP without the GBD should not be lower than the "euro protocol" limit.
However, it may not be above the limit set out in the insurance contract.
The idea, of course, is theoretically able to broadcast both the DPS and the roads.
But mostly, it doesn't come to an insult or a car or an insurance.
The latests have already been reported about a serious threat to growth of age, which could lead to the introduction of new rules on casco payments.
What the leaders have, it is difficult to deal with what ways to overcome the Russian conservate.
In most cases, the leader will wait for hours to form a small deal, because it is so confident.
And it is not yet easier to win the drivers or to convince the leaders in the confidence of the Euro Protocol.
The certificate will make a nameless and unrevocable
Minfin wants to prohibit the provider's certificates, so he will allow banks to make them an analogue of unnecessary contribution.
Minfin prepares a draft law that will prohibit the certificates of the provider.
This instrument has recently put the population into account, since the taxes are above than the bank contributions.
The fact is that the provider ' s certificates are not in the investment insurance system, and the bank is involved in the profit because it is not necessary to calculate the Agency ' s Agency ' s insurance.
The importance of the situation is that this step is planned to take due to small and medium banks that distribute such certificates and suffer from Sberbank and Moscow Bank, which, according to the ASCB, control 98 per cent of the profile market.
The Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency, consists of approximately 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ACP, is that the clients of a small bank buying such a certificate are trying to receive money in the ASCB.
They may assume that their appropriations are insured without sufficient financial software and buying certificates on the provider.
The absence of insurance insurance on these certificates in case of remission of the bank's licence may lead to disappointment and stress.
The Agency had occurred when the preliminary certificate holders were trying to recover the insurance by the court,” said the ACP.
The problem, of course, is conscious.
Because the purchasers of certificates will still be no one, since they have no right to refund from the State under law.
If the case was that the instrument was not insured in the ASCII, it would also prohibit metal accounts on which citizens were included in the grams of one of the four metals: gold, silver, plates and paladius.
Because these accounts do not fall into the investment insurance system, but they are still trying.
The case is, mostly, that the certificates on the prosecutor are a very valuable bow which can actually be expressed in the role of Quazideneg.
Their movement is practically not controlled: any client of the bank may buy a certificate, submit to any citizen, and before the detection of such certificate may change households.
The draft legislation does not have a statement that the certificate must be a valuable bow which should be maintained in the depositary.
In order to submit the pillar to the banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to delay.
That means, the analogue of an unrevocable contribution that bankiers have long been aware of.

Two Unions Meeting
High-level negotiations in Minsk did not solve problems for which they were connected, but were born a new format: the first Union had meet the first places of the future Asian
The EU leaders and the Democratic Union first discussed a number of ' burning problems '.
If such structure is to work effectively, it is incomprehensible; therefore clearly who has drawn off the sticks from the same.
Questions on this account on August 26, when the Belarus and after them and the other Jews and peers saw the new president Lucashenko televisions.
The Belarus leader showed an example of a detailed appreciation, which was the behavior of a man who just disturbed the Jack Poth - and planned the dignity of age in the higher society.
How Maydan Lukašenko helped
The arrival to Minsk with three main Commissioners (ministers of the EU) who met Lukashenko and allowed him to speak on their name on a final briffine, not just to stimulate the president's 20-year-old stage.
This is an application to recognize Minska by the full-right subject of the Peking Policy and the main mediator of Ukraine crisis.
The older analysis of the Belarus Institute of Researchs of Denis Melianc sure: From now on, Brussels will not be able to talk to Minsk the same tone as before.
"What Catherine Estone met Lucashenko's tante, it gives the idea that the EU will continue to be frozen," he said, "Feeling."
This is a hidden part of the issberg: the preparation of the Belarus authorities started long before November Mayan in Kiev in 2013.
"The results and the EU are successful negotiations on the simplification of the visa regime and the readmission, the modernisation dialogue, " recalls the " Fire '", and negotiations on international security have been conducted from the United States.
The states even took some sanctions.
As a result of Ukrainian events, they themselves and the response of Belarus ' s leadership only highlighted this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, has been able to keep with Ukraine too heavy to not lose the mutual trade, but President Porozhenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarus leader, who did not recognize the Crime Accession to Russia and invited Professors in Donbass to be disturbed, did not deal with Moscow.
Minsk did not go out of the Thamogen Union, nor from the ODCB, but the Russian Aviation Base is located in Baranovich.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on Ukrainian issue - and assessed it by Belarus experts.
As Lucashenko is successful to the political division, it will be shown how often Minsk must take meetings in the form of EU+TS in the nearby time.
In the press service of the EU High Representative on External Policy and Diploms, Catherine Estone did not be able to answer operationally the questions that Brussels expected from a new form of relations.
Press Secretary Eston Maya Kosiančich only stated " Fire" that this issue is not priority in the background of the solutions to war and world issues.
It was reported that the place of the meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new form could also be Kazakhstan.
As a degty for Minsk, President Nursultan Nazarbaijev stated that he had been appealed to the representatives of the Russian union.
Nevertheless, at the final brifing Alexander Lukashenko: All the parties do not dispute to Minsk to remain a central area for meetings as well as in the form of Russia - OBCE - Ukraine and at the heads of States and High Representatives of the Committee.
This means that the "Last Dictator" has the status of a handful leader who helps solve the global problem.
Best Friend of the farmer
The EU delegation, including trade and energy commissaries, has already been drawn up to the conclusion: the main pattern of the same is not the tragic situation in Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the schedule of future gas supply negotiations and the discharge of the concerns of the TS countries in the Agreement on the Association of Ukraine with the EU seems to be greater than peaceful statements without specific dates and numbers.
However, the Commissioner of Trade Carl De Huht said that the EU representatives "come to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not against".
It seems, however, that even in the economic crisis in Ukraine "is" to Belarus.
His consequences, and in the first place, the western and Russian sanctions, give Minsk, which is still a long-term sanction pressure for the maneur.
According to the Museum Scientific Research Centre, an ex-candidate at the president of Jaroslav Romanchuk, Peace investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus to provide agricultural production in the RF for sanctions.
These are the provisions schemes for which Vladimir Putin burned Minsk.
"The Initiators of these schemes, Romanchuk "Feeling", was a statement not the Belarus businessmen, but the Russian companies.
They have long worked on the supply schemes of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are disrupted.
The Russian business needs to restore them, even through the middle of the Belarus structures.
Secondly, the expert continues - that many Ukrainian companies are not going to make production in Belarus from Ukrainian Syria, too with the orientation to the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have 4 billion dollars of export to Russia, and the Belarus trade schemes can now be completely stressed."
Romanchuk considers the role of the farmer for the EU and the TS negotiations ideal for Lucashenko and the development of economic relations with the EU.
He recalls that the loss of the EU agriculture sector from Moscow sanctions is estimated at 5 to 10 billion, and the Commission has currently offered only 125 million compensations to agraries.
The Belarus Chairman may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences of farmers.
This may lead Lucashenko to the EU to a limited height.
Accommodation without initiative
Catherine Estone welcomed the Belarus authorities for the initiative of the Sammit.
But the paradox is that official Minsk from his active role in the birth of TS+EU, and the Belarus leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague underlined that the new format initiator and all of Kiev.
"This was your proposal to meet, without having been able to discuss, not to make a decision, after signing the EU Association Treaty, in the situation that was at the moment in Ukraine," he referred to Peter Porozhenko to the cameras.
However, observers expressed this as an attempt to relax Moscow, which, as a result, was essentially contrary to the media of Minska, which highly increases its political weight.
In the Belarus diploma, the science emphasizes carefully that Belarus, in the organization of EU and TS interactions on its country, does not pursue useful objectives, but the final objective of such form is the creation in the future of a single economic space from Lisbon to the East.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, moves and continues the leading of our Russian Federation Federation, our leader," said the "Feed" in the Middle of Belarussia, a news, where the recently grouped words are chosen.
In Moscow there may be areas with income
The Government of Moscow considers the possibility of introducing areas with a trailer as a method of combating the main roads on the similarity with other major cities of the world, transmitting M24.ru with the Moscow transport vessel in Licsuov.
One of the options that successfully recommended itself is an entry.
It's an expert opinion, we'll oblige to study it, we'll look at all and plus.
To say that some decisions have been taken for this behavior until early," said Lixuts.
Zamera stressed that the capital authorities were very important in Asian cities, which were similar to Moscow by structure and threat.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the building of the central ring car, added to Lixutus.
The recently started construction of the Central Road Road is an example of that it is not obliged to pass the whole traffic through Moscow.
If there was a sufficient infrastructure of the railway, it would not be necessary to have a transit traffic in Moscow," said the Zammer.
Lixutus also stated that the introduction of parking parks had been able to deploy stone streets.
And, according to his statement, the capital authorities are not planned to stay on the ground.
On August 26, Sergei Sobiain's Major of the Russian capital was in the ceremonie of the construction of the first travel complex of the Moscow Central Road Road Road (CAD).
Cookie is wrong
The film of Frank Miller and Robert Rodriges "The town of sins 2: The woman for which you should kill" did not the revolution that he could expect.
The first ' City of Sins ' (2005), which was set up at the minimum but symbol of the participation of Quen - Tarantino, has made a revolution in films, comics and literature nuas.
Sickwell is also revolutionary: in the meaning that he distorts the "tezis - antithesis - synthesis" basically for modern thinking (if it understands the universe nuar and the comics space).
From now on, it should be read, "thesis is antensis - chaos."
"The city of sins-2" is haotic and dramaturg, and at philosophy level: both times he is haotic in foolish meaning of words.
Yes, part of the heroes knowing the first city, although, behold, Marve (Mickey Rurk), remembers, ended the life on the chair, and there, nothing, just can take -- in the role of a people's companion -- from the air of the knife and the other topours with the wounds.
But the elders literally broke the rocks of news, as if they were broken into the city from any other movie, about the meaning and expression of which the viewers ask not to be concerned.
Yes, his story, insanely oppressed by the most interesting authors, in the superstitional player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Lewi).
It has a fresh-friendly Eve Lord (Eve Green) and something that recompenses Duita (J. Brolin).
But this cup, in which Duita, we say, doesn't distinguish from Johnny, is more than the other parts of the body, persons are wearing with an immortal rule of ability, not even distress, nor even half-sufficiency.
It's not people, but we know that it's a nuar: a yearly bastard, too confident of itself, a player who enjoys the "meal jail" detective who's corrupted with a senator.
Well, when the epic is ovaling from the acety and the acety, it's not a movie anymore, but a abstract life record.
And it is just funny to put an abstract livelihood on the logic of the ingredient.
Moreover, even in this world’s summit, there is something continuous.
The first ' City' fighting bullets continue to keep round defence from those who seduce their family forces of darkness.
Yeah, and the look of the child's not Hartigan, and he's looking at the fire, and Bruce Willis always is happy to look at.
The main problem of the town of sins 2 is the second.
Frank Miller was a good idea that as a soldier was talentably united with comics and noir, and as a register, he turned the idea of how to carry comics on the screen.
Comics and Nuars are two aggressively opposed "reality".
The Comic Fenomen was born at the end of the 1920s, while the romans of Dashila H'Meta "Crovaw Tava" (1929), "Maltian Shool" (1930) and "Steckled Key" (1931) created the canon of Nuar, who was then called "hard-boiled school" - "hard-boiled school".
Well, or pulp fiction.
The comics gave to Hollywood many tens of heroes: from Popaya's sea, a spinner that gave him rich power, Superman, Bethman and the sister Dick Tracy to Ha, Tora, Man-pauka and other "productors".
But in any movies for comics, there was something damaged: painted persons wouldn't want to cross the screen flesh, remained inherents in their "real" world 's "slave" wills.
Moreover, they were clearly missing "existences".
In contrast, the most existing genre of the world literature.
After World Wars, the traditional role, with anxieties, characters, family scandales and historical background, lost conviction.
What Forsites, which are Tibo and Rugon-Makkari, even the Balcones and Rostovies, are thinking after Verden, Auschwitz and Hirosims?
Such a romance is peacefully mute in the form of a mixed oper, and the criminal is definition of the marginal romance has increased to the level of philosophy prose.
X's on his skin will know what it's to work as a sanitary on the front.
He was a communist.
How, at least, they were close to the company and the chair of a genre, such as the writers of Horas and Jim Tompson, registers of Jule Dassen, Joseph Louzie, Edward Dmitric.
So the noir, which they put, first, the back and the cycle, and the second, is totally social.
It's almost an American sociealism option.
The first 'Group of sins' was noticed exactly that it was anti-natural but organically associated comic with a nuar.
The first comics on the screen lived without sharing his nature's graph and not being "actual" film.
The darkness of the selling world, where the cardinal ordered murder, and the senator covered the wonderful son of sadist, was full of dignity before the X.
And the vital details of the decoration of the sadist of the decoration, before the genius James Elroy, the author of the Black Orchidee, and the best, that is, declaratively, the representative of the neonaar.
"The town of sins 2" is not even a decline, but the capital of the radical stylistic of Miller Rodriges before the comic tradition.
It's probably because of 3D technology.
When you look at the second town of sins, you feel captured in a glassy layer in which the snow sleeps a sinful cloak.
However, most often it's not snow, but blood labels, but what difference?
Well, what about the ability and talking nothing.
Because it's only when somewhere we have somewhere, it's pushing and on the surface of a crazy bottle, but there's a normal world where you can return the straight path, or, let's say, to the unconfortable parents, that its loser is punished.
But if there is no place in the city of sin except sin, there is no sin any more, but the standard.
She's nice, like any norm.
Chaos "The City of Sins 2" is just crazy.
Justice for the fatherly prosecution has given this little, but a little sin.
The titles are warned: The movie contains smoke scenes.
According to the vision, in the most vegetarian episode whose fingerprints a man gives it to the Adski Humor.
X would like it.
France's socialists must "see and bring France in order", says Frasua Holland's key union
Mr. Vall invited the deeply divided left forces to "demonstrate the heavy attitude" to the subsequent attacks of the President of the Socialist whose interruptions had not been approved in the pressing majority of the French.

However, Cristian Toberi, Minister of Justice, came to the assembly of non-members of the parliament from the Socialist Party and discriminated the Socialist Party because it allowed the French to "lose faith in the future".
Marin le Pe, the leader of the extreme right national front, has expressed disappointment to persistent internal conflicts among socialists, saying that it does not assume that the new Government of Valla will continue for several months.
France Oland is a naked king, but the naked and prince Manuel Valle, who had to gather the new government when it was not before.
"And the new will not be held by the east or winter," reporters said Ms. Le Pen.
She repeatedly invited her party to the growth of the parliament, saying that she was sure that the party could easily win on a long-term election and be ready to manage.
The French Governing Party survived a disagreement in Marth Municipal elections, and the extreme right national front came first to the EU elections in May.
The question of the Resurrection Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believed that the Socialist Party was risked by a few contrary fractions to the end of Mr. Holland's President's date in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, Politologist at the University of Syans Po, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist of the Government would not be able to correct the economy and the record without a record.
"He has a little time, but the public view has to feel quickly that something changes," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may become worse.

And the democratics of Hong Kong's movement make the statement of the Chinese representative on the day following the decision on elections
A group of citizens of loyal Peking stood nearby, mixing the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Committee of the University of People's Representatives on Sunday has determined a procedure for which two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the elections of Hong Kong's rue in 2017.
All candidates must have a dream of support for most members of the Deputy Committee, which will probably be filled with Peking loyalty.
The decision makes it almost unfair to the democratic opposition to fall into the electoral bulletin and for the democracy activists of the movement to promise again to stop the Hong Kong financial center with the Occupy Central protests.
Political reaction is the main source of stress in Hong Kong, since Chinese party leaders are afraid that the call to democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Pekin's Peking document described China's control over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists carried out a neo-reference on elections in the administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the business centre of the city and set up a seat.
Brifing Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Office on Conferences in Hong Kong.
Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the University Assembly of the People's Representatives of Jang Rongshun and the Vice-President of the Office of Hong Kong and Macao of the State Council of Fang Wei were also to speak on a series of briffins during the day.
Students said that they would be gathered to the head of the Government of Hong Kong in the second half day.
The United Kingdom has not mentioned the democracy of the Government for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its Government.
Israel's authorities are to join 400 ga land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
Israel’s authorities declared that 400 hectares of the land were attached to the west of the Jordan River, which belonged to the Palestinian autonomy.
As the Bi Bi-by-si transmets, the decision to join the South Bethlehem is to pay for the covering and killing of three Israeli adults in June of this year.
Israel ' s Defence Ministry stated that the territory was captured on Sunday and ordered military authorities to set up the administrative administration on the west.
According to the representative of Sector Gaza Saiba Arika, the world public should call Israel to answer the "continuing village activity in the west of Jordan and East Jerusalem".
Putin requires Kiev to start negotiations on the " State" of Eastern Ukraine
According to the Russian news reports of his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin needed Sunday to stop the Ukrainian Government's fight against separatists in the east country and immediately started the negotiation on the "statity" of the region.
His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin was not intended to claim that the Eastern Ukraine territory would be part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine should be revised in order to give the Russian speaking region the opportunity to protect its rights and interests.
However, Pu's invitation to the Government of Kiev to begin negotiations with the Prorocy rebels as a clear term that he should have since the beginning of bloodproliferation five months ago: Help separatists to take the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly announced territory of New York real independence to approach Russia, not West.
In the Interview of the First Television Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of the territorial separatists in the East Donec and Lugan areas, which were disappointed in March and April after Moscow Yenx's half-ukrainian islands Crym 18 March.
Chruml and separatists recently called the disappointed territory of Novorosia, or New Russia, a name sent to the revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that everyone who believes that peace negotiations will happen in the nearest future when Ukrainian policies start campaigning to Parliamentary elections on 26 October and when government armies attack peaceful residences in the sustainable separatists of the regions, ITAR-TASS reported.
"We must immediately begin to contain negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the political system of society and the State status of South-East Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of people there," he said.
Peskov said that the words of Pu of the State were in the context of a broader autonomy that was discussed during months with the runners in Kiev in trying to refresh fears in Russian areas that their cultural and language rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give east regions autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a question to discuss between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "for this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the internal Ukraine conflict."
Involving the press secretary of Creml to correct the "false interpretation" words of Pu's, the Russian leadership has underlined the decision to conduct a separatist resurrect on the east in other ways than the open arrest of Crime, where the majority of 2 million people are ethnic Russian.
Moscow would have to endure a much more difficult struggle in order to join even the Danish and the Lugan area of Eastern Ukraine, since most of 6.5 million people were not Russian, and the challenges before the start of the conflict were a wide support for the desire to remain within Ukraine.
The Russian diplomats discussed at forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to determine trade agreements and external policies, in fact, by delivering Krim's real control over the territory that would join the Russian main territory with Krim.
On the black island, attended five months ago, the main Russian military floor, as well as commercial marine institutions and historical marine curriculums.
The regions between the Russian Cross Region and the Crime also have shakes, factories and leather facilities that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
The Ukrainian President Peter Porozhenko proposed during its inaugurational matter on 7 June that Ukrainian legislators after new elections should focus on amendments to the constitution that allow the regions to grant great control of their languages and status.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from the view of Cremela and the separatists, in the enforcement and encouraging of which Moscow is accused.
The latest invitation to Pueva to agree with the leaders of separatists as with them followed the new resurrections last week after Russian armies and dances entered into East Ukraine from the first peaceful area of Asian Sea.
Supported Russian separatists took the control of the city of Novoazsk in the Ukrainian Security Service, which said that it was the beginning of the campaign for the occupation of the Crymean Territory.
This has resulted in large civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, the stational port of 500 000 people, which is between Novoaza and the crucial transition to Crimea.
On Saturday, the Breakfast invited the assembly of leaders of the Union in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Response, which was independent of 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of unreversality," he warned Puroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks now in Ukraine's territory.
The EU Sammit did not adopt certain measures; leaders invited the project to establish more serious sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in the case of any scaling of Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their places in Ilawish after two Russian armies and 1000 military soldiers entered into the Donek region last week to support the experienced distress of separatists, Colonel Andrew Lisenko, president of the Council on National Security and Defense of Ukraine, reporters in Kyewa on the Sabbath.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who, according to the information, were held in Ilawish as a result of Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday to 10 Russian airports in the Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko reported on Sunday.

The potential way of stealing of defeated denominations has been detected
The mass breakdown of star accounts may be produced by vulnerableness in the application Find My Phone.
The potential development scenario of events described the Next Web resource.
The Github resource was opened a script in Python, which allowed you to choose passwords for the Apple Find My Phone Service.
This service allows you to follow the iPhone location.
It is used to access the same connection to login and Apple ID as to access the Apple iCloud cloud from which the names were stolen.
The script enabled the search method to identify the password from Find My Phone.
In this method, all character summaries are continuously introduced, starting with the most common passwords used.
The author of the script acknowledged that the number of password options is unlimited in the Find My Phone service.
If the security system is organized correctly after several failure attempts to enter a wrong password, the account should be locked and report to the user the crash attempt.
Because of vulnerableness, the users have not received any message about trying to get the password to their account.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and ispo. It is for access to iCloud.
According to the Hackapp user report in Twitter, vulnerableness was found two days ago, on Saturday, and a scripting program was written to it to choose passwords.
The vulnerableness is currently closed: after five trials of access to the service is blocked.
The resource related to Hackapp user and noted that the above vulnerableness is characteristic for many services, but noted that it had no evidence that such vulnerableness was used to access the "star" account.
It's not me, plz RT
The Twitter Premier Minister has shown outside records in a series of times
Although there is no strong evidence of the use of vulnerability in Find My Phone for the stealing of graphs, it has already been an advantage of the use of this service.
Hackers were captured by the management of the device and required redemption from the owners.
In that case, Apple stated that the cloud safety in this case was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the pre-Minist Minister RF Dmitria Medvedev was also broken before.
If the criminals received access to the iCloud described above, there could also be a password for the Government's head account in the microloging service.
The Next Web Resource could not get Apple comments for vulnerableness in Find My Phone.

The heart expression ≥ is a biological universal for the creation, and each participant in the creation of a body and a group of muscles is not an additional means of expressing power and threat, found by the scientists of Australia and the United States.
They reported their openings in the magazine Evolution and Human Behavior, and they can be read shortly in the press relization of the Californian University in Santa Barbara.
The wrath expression is moved and left down, you are in a thin line of lips, the narrows are the same in all cultures, and even blind from the birth of children who have never seen it, notices the leader of Aaron Sell.
In the framework of a major investigation of the project, a dedicated nature of anger, the scientists discovered that this emotion had occurred for effective guidelines during the conflict.
As far as the damage of a person can be brought to another, the more he has to dictate his conditions, and he brings it to the visitor with anger.
Researchers found under their hypothesis and other: people are physically more disturbing and moved to the hands, considering themselves capable of linking other unnecessary conditions to them, as well as the strong methods of solution to peaceful conflicts.
Regarding that anger is primarily the " trade emotion", the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of mouse creating a sincere expression should represent an irritant person more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of a conference - and thus make it more agreeable with its conditions to avoid a conflict.
In order to verify this hypothesis, researchers have found on the computer where each of the seven elements of anger had or was missing, and have shown them to the in-acters.
Although the lost broadcasts or the foreheaded bathrooms did not make the face bad, the person of such kinds of persons, more powerful physical parts of the investigation, had recognised a singleness.
The wrath of humans, as in animals, is a threat: an excessive manifestation of its own force, which requires to agree and obey.
The man split the narrows and presses the lips with the same purpose as the lake that hopes, or the grandmother, which demonstrates his clothes.
"The wrath " begins" by refusing the meeting to accept the situation, and the person accepts the form, which is most effectively demonstrating the consequence of this refus.
But the most vulnerable is that none of the elements of anger is productive, all of them are expressing the same," said antropologist John Tuby.
