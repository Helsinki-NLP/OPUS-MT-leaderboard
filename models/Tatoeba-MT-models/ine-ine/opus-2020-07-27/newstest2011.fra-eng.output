CSSD doesn't know Voldemort or Pasticery in Prague.
The newly chosen CSSD at the capital office will apparently have to overflow a real language barry to understand at the level of the municipal advice with their older and new ODS colleagues.
The new members of the CSSD municipal Council have been tested, namely, if they know the argot that was born in the past years in the Maurice, when they were partners of the current coalition in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cryme has passed through the era of Major Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations and causes of metabolism.
It is a surprise that it has been discovered that the new elections do not understand the terms with well.
At least they say it.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I'm a youth in the praised policy, reacted Lucas Kaucky, the elue to culture at the test of the vocabulary of the "parrain".
And with regard to the political veteran, elu Karel Brezina has responded in the same way.
For example, the sense of golf.
"It's the only expression of those you're offering me to use."
Otherwise, I don't use the argout.
From the vocabulary, whose day Actune.cz has chosen the expressions in June of this year before the pre-eectoral convention of the ODS, the editor has chosen 6 examples, in particular those associated with the Majorship of Prague.
The socialists explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf cup in Prague", "to the patience", "bovine knife", "capital trahison" and "tolerance".
Three of the elections agreed for the chez, the fourth Antonin Weinert, who must lead the education in Prague in the future - had promised a maintenance but then did not break the phone.
The fifth election Peter Dolinek squared the test.
"I don't take care of all these things and how the representatives of the civil democracy are enjoyed: I will not give my opinion."
"I am currently concerned about how we will understand our programmes," he responded.
As we have heard, Ellious Lukas Kaucky would not appear to be recognized in the above end, that this is the influence of Janousek on the businessmen and friends of the former Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he made in the test is "the biggest golf cup in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel" said Kaucky and immediately said, "I know the journals."
"I'll have to pay a language course," he pleases.
Not only the matator Karel Brezina but also Lucas Plachy, the elu for the environment, knows that the golf tunel is the Blanko tunnel.
The two social-democrates know who is actually Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the personnage - he thinks about "Go to the pastery".
"I think it's to go to a company," Plachy's ready to believe that it's Janousek's company seat.
On the same tone, Brezina reminds that he draws his knowledge rather than newspapers and not any vocabulary that he would use.
According to the test candidates, there is no argothic lessons in the social democracy.
"I've taken advice with agees, and it seems that we really don't have something like that."
"The names sometimes are used for abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, that members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza to the oil but I don't know if my teachers call me like that, Karel Brezina admits about surnames.
The day Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
Weinert Elu is Papy for the members of the Party or at least friendly, the representative Miroslav Poche, who has attached attention to him before the elections by the scrockers during the sponsoring of the party, is called "the small game".
The surnames are also the only ones that allow social-democracy employees within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn't like to hear Hulda, but the Day of Akutel.cz has stored another surname for this praised president.
"Doctor in Matrake Right" seems to be reminded that Peter Hulinsky has received his title as a doctor in the right of JUDr. at the Bratislava police academy.
The Government wants to reduce the torture of the "surkers", edited a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared too have common trades.
Instead of the old generation, they cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "surcher" is isolated not to threaten the rest of the village.
"The man has this destination very rarely."
"We do not also judge young women in good health because they participate in the work and gather children," says a sister who cares for the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have been rejected by the company.
The local government decided to intervene against this "social" measure.
He edited a brochure that should help to limit the jail to the girls.
The case's a "hic".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," warned the Daily Die Standard about the inconvenience of written education.
The accusation of sorcery is coherent in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbor of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had spared him.
This is the BBC server who transmitted this information.
It's a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves ritual onctions was burned in the contact of the woman.
The oil flammed, it seems, when the team wanted to throw the bad spirit of the woman.
The isolation of "scores" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The Daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year entrepreneur of Burkina Faso: "The human spirit foods have always represented a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is attempting to reduce herds, she was not later than the President even saw to participate in her last year.
"The President Dzammi, after the death of his tante, launched a wide jail to the sheriffs that would like to have participated in his death and would have been endeavored by the black magic to kill the President too."
"Guinea's calls near the rescue brought to the presidential close to Kanilai, under the protection of the police and the personal guard of the President, men and women chosen in the villages of the villages," the "Amnesty International".
Closing the prisoners of drinking a potion based on plants on hallucinogene effects that also result in other effects on renes and instincts.
Two prisoners haven't survived there.
The international pressure is about a thousand people who were released in freedom.
Bakal’s site: The pools are heavy, and he signed a higher lottery.
An older man is out of the door of the RPG Byty client center of the "carbon bar" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to praise in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying under the arm a record with three new location contracts for three apartments: his, his daughter's and his son who was trained to clean a penalty.
The deregulation has increased the loan to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500, the child will have to decide from the next year for a apartment 2+1 of the second category 4100 corners.
"And there is no warm water and heating functions for solid fuel," shows the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the power of signing.
"But I signed even," he explains you in anger and half-signed motive.
The citizen of the BytyOKD.cz apartments, who described the new location conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises the sites to not sign and wait until 7 December, the date to which a package will be made to explain the method to follow.
But the man reacts to this by a gesture of hand.
"The one says that, the other says something else" by breathing the mouths.
The Ostrava region becomes the lab of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what most of the apartments in Czech Republic expect, whose loans do not correspond to the market price.
Curtualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in the Havirovska street is one of the four of the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09:00 of the morning.
Just next to the door is a guard of a security company with a device to call clients.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is aligned on the tactile.
One pressure and a paper with a number out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number already begins s'illum' on the big ıran under the top of the waiting room.
In a second fraction, it's your tour.
After a short time, an old couple comes to learn about the lodge, but the new lowers do not touch people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to resolve coherent problems, such as everywhere - requires repairs, insurance events and other.
In the Ostrava region, people of more than 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments have covered the courts with the new bail contracts in their letter box since approximately half November.
RPG Byty offers them increases in loans from 15 to 38 per cent.
The special guichet for new loyers has been opened to the public since 18 November.
"He has worked for nearly a week, so it is still at the test" answers, after a hesitation instant, the employee behind the guichet when the client is present as a journalist.
Degradation and old Bakal minor apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The President of the Parliament and originating in the region of Ostrava Lubo _ Zaoralek of the Social Democrats has stated that it is sufficiently supported before elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They haven't even changed a board in the wcs, the men mentioned in introduction.
However, mostly, employees, retirements coming to be sure that they will receive a restoration on the new price of the loan if they sign now as the RPG promised in a special offer.
It is a restoration of half the amount of the loan that the other lotteries will receive which have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" guichet of the Havirovaska street is not really appealed by questions.
"For the 360 clients who arrived yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to lodge," indicates the employee at the guichet.
Yet, RPG puts both on its website and in the vitrines of individual interviews on lowers when necessary.
If the two parties do not hear on the law, it shall be an independent court who will make the decision.
"It is not threats but only to inform about the unique and unique way of action," indicates the RPG on its website.
"No one's going to the court" thinks one of the RPG Byty employees and the man in the street before the customer center gives him the right.
"I have 13,000 corners and I have 5000 corners to eat, I don't have enough to go to the court," he said.
The employee suddenly feels bad.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks no one to sign and therefore people are waiting," she says.
The rule of laws ends in Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, RPG Byty, are economic needs.
"And, moreover, the current laws do not always reach the level necessary for simple maintenance of the apartment fund," reminds Paul Klimes, director of RPG Byty's resident portfolio, that this is exactly the negativity of the fund for the accommodation that makes the host in anger is the main reason for the lottery.
However, between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in 4 billion apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014.
However, the big ́ran ́s in the front of rebounds from the Havirosvka street's waiting room, repeated a few of the information indicated in red.
'The lodging in 2011 is 15 per cent and is not less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments.'
"And it will always be at more than 7.50 Czech corners on m2 per month," indicates the won.
38 percent of the 38 percent only covers 400 apartments of the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase in a very low sum of 19.66 Czech corners to m2," RPG says.
The next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises deregulation will not cause radical but progressive increase between 4 and 8 years.
It has other commitments: all the money of the rental (see the graph) is rendered to the apartments in the form of heating economy - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on laws have the priority.
The maternal oil is also part of the offices.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new seat of the Arch. Design company.
Nobody could have expected that it also opens a mini-materical school with everything that is needed - color walls, imaginative mobiles, games and finally an area of miniature games on the terrace.
Since October of the last year, children of the Arch. design employees can be made there.
The Arch. Design Arch Arch Arch Arch-architectural project company, whose athletes produced a large number of buildings in Brno, imagined his minor mother school from the first bathrooms of the Ariopoint building.
It works about 90 people, especially as age of children, and it was important that women and project leaders quickly return to work.
At the same time as decreased work contracts, the maternal oil is a bonus proposed to its employees by the Arch. Design. in the framework of its social programme.
Constructors and Others have thus the opportunity to work with care for children.
These are the employees of Arch.Design.theys themselves who imagined this maternal school and with the support of the direction, they could have a contribution from the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs.
The main school is financed by the European Social Fund through the operational programme of the Human Resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to finance funding (height of 2.8000 Czech crowns), they could buy equipment and equipment and after two years a qualified staff and the road.
After the use of the finance funding (two years) the Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to make the main school work on its own funds.
The preparation of the project was a year and it was the Economy rating company who helped to make the request for a dotation.
Child care is assured by a qualified staff, a whole day a wedding and a mother-institute takes care of children. Children can go to the maternal oil without age limit, but they have more than three opportunities for most of them.
As it is a "mining mother school" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but in the course of the day there are more to be replaced.
The functioning of the olive is supple; the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without looking at the hierarchy position.
Although this is an individual care and education, the mini-school programme is comparable to the pre-school education programme.
Children do not just play, but a quality education is also assured - from the beginning to preparation for oil is learned.
The class is not only equipped with imaginative games and games but also with a player that children can use.
The presence of children in the society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their children and not have the stress of a delay to go to search for children in a remote school from their parents' job.
Parents therefore use their worktime in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty between employee and employee has been created.
Arch.Design.s is thus recorded among companies who offer a choice bonus for recruiting new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this programme strengthen the marketing of RHs.
The house in the bones is fascinated yet after 100 years. Eye a look inside Gaudi.
The tower is at the back of a prehistoric saurian, the scale to a vertebral column of dinosaur and the balconies at open fishing bullets.
This is the house of Casa Battlo in Barcelona of the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house has received the surname of Maison in bones from the locals.
Organic forms, wild colors, steel usage, carriers and mosaic fragments, façade reminding of eheels and everywhere presents of corbs, this is all that is yipical for the New Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The front of the house drives his dream lines, its colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
In a more detailed observation, the geometry, the rythm and the order are considered accurately.
In the night, the house's fasade becomes even more dramatic and is aligned in such a way that the printing of colors is strengthened.
The enrollment and torsion of forms also appear inside with the same measure.
The wood copys window frames, balloons, the decaying elements of the doors, the oeilton and the lambs.
The Battlo house, which is located in the E°mple quarter in the marketing street Passeig de Gracia at number. 43, was born from the building of a house of 1877 from the architect Emily Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction was made for two years and the house finished in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, insisted on demolition of the old construction and construction of another new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of a better and better market rebuilding.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a house of multiple apartments was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is exactly on its project that the decorations for a apartment of representation of the owner of the immeuble and the use of the Mosaic for the Fazade are born.
For the façade, they also worked with other artists and creators.
The joint work for the Casa Battlo House's plans began by a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the building of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The locals overnoemed the warm house right after its end because of its organic forms "The House in the bone".
Others, with regard to the specific mechanism for opening windows, called it "the house that swallows".
On the top of the building, there is a sword similar to the Catalogue patron of Saint Georges.
Other elements of building sculpture contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in his central heating time, with age events and typical chemicals.
Their inclination of 45 degrees ≥ strange.
During the creation of Gaudi, he absolutely did not comply with the building directives and did not allow them to interfere.
At the beginning of the construction, he received from the city the permission to build, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after the end, the municipal Council was threatened and requested amendments.
For example, the members of the municipal Council did not appreciate that the construction pillars were involved in the public trottoir.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and gained satisfaction) to praise the two highest stages.
The owner demanded the lower stages.
In the gallery at the second stage there was a common room and the third a room and a private part of the apartment.
The debugged refrigeration was louded with a bathroom.
The entire house of six stages is shared by a stage by which it is passed up to an independent tower terrace.
All right angles and right lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and replacement by corb walls.
Gaudi also worked the modern concept of space connection.
The common party can be linked completely by opening the doors of the rooms and the high company can be comfortable or be limited to the private space for more intimate entrepreneurs.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction has also received news made a non-traditional toilet and two additional stages.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glasses with which the inner heart is covered and with light puits.
The two-colored game gives a maximum light in all areas of the house.
It was simply enough to partake of the principle that white reflects more than the shadow that, rather, absorbs the sun's radians.
The Casa Battlo house which was registered in 2005 in the World Patrimoine Fund of Unesco may be visited by each.
At the first place of the house, the most spaceful and beautiful apartment is accessible to the public.
The owners decided to deal with this step in 2002 at the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the famous Creator's birth.
They continued the visits because they found that it was a profitable company and they expanded the field of visits to the common spaces and to the landscape, including tower terraces.
The income billet in the memory is actually not decent and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirements, groups and containers of tourist cards have 20 percent of rabai.
The sum is still above the input price in the other Gaudi constructions in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic tours, you must quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the house and visit the house completely.
How to choose a math and a summier: Women have other criteria than men.
No ostentative frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved at bed, so mathematic and summier give real basis for a good bed.
They must, of course, comply coherently to please a particular user.
The choice of many things is determining: weight, size, age, health status and owner's sex.
The type of inside in which we are going to put the matlas and the summier is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the campaign house where latex mathematics are not permanently suitable because they are "heating" duly.
They, above all, have more weight than standard polyuretan mathematics.
They are often needed to be returned.
If they also don't have enough ventilation channels in the heart and they remain on a solid board, they keep humidity.
The habit is so determining in the choice.
Whoever passs the time in the foreigner, where often uses very spacious mathematics with a smoking bed, will feel hard on a low and hard surface.
"It is so that all hokeyists who return from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their feet, their feet and coasts, they needed mathematics with a grassing ramped mouse bed."
"There are also recommended for people who suffer diabetes who have a disturbance of the nervous system that cause bad "information" of anticulations and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova, specialist in rebuilt cells.
That's why a few years ago, the mathematics with the pearl mouse conquered hokeyists and other customers.
"Aauourd today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Tropico Czech, for example, have suitable mathematics.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to be able to appreciate a purple mouse.
This mirror just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape its absorbed heat or well adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing presses you and you won't return in the night like after a difficult match.
You just sleep better.
Parseous mouse also works as a protection against squares.
For the choice of the mathematics according to your size, you must → the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
So a man and a woman with a size of 180 cm need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a two-place bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm.
For beds at one place, for example, singles, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's comfortable in case of visit.
'Although it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are sleeping on your back, you should put your hands in comfortable way with the cookies fully plugged. Helena Prokopova, President of the Bourreliers-matelassiers and discorators Association, which has been dedicated to the problems of a healthy dream and the engineering of the mobile and teacher in specialized schools.
For a bed at two places each needs his own summer and mathematics, so attention while buying a good choice of the height of the matlas.
Otherwise, you will only stay up to the summary at different heights and it is not effective on all bed frames.
Mouse mathematics should have a minimum height of 14 cm, at least 15 cm mathematics, of which for the shape and aeroplane bed at least three metres.
"To touch or sit in position on the mathematics you don't have to feel the resorts," advises Helena Prokopova.
Each shot asks a well-determined guy to summer.
The bed-some, when the matlas and the summier are united as females sisters, there is nothing to do in the rooms to sleep.
The mathematics have been very bad; we don't have to wash it, what's doing right now.
And since during the night, we usually transpire from 0.2 to 0.75 l sugar, it's just after 5/7 years, the mathematical starts to remember a large (and thrown) too.
For this reason, experts are to make a complaint on a 25-year-old life duration for a mathematic or a life-life guarantee.
But it's all her but.
And for this a experience advice from the sellers: for a 120/140cm mathematical, reject, for the clothing of mathematics, hygiene or lavage, but rather make a protective math that you can easily get back and wash.
And even though in our day it is often to manufacture closing garments for all the enemy, it means that after the opening we have two parts (for the lavage and size of the machine to wash it is very important!) otherwise, the manipulation for the large models (and for one person) becomes when wearing them a fight between a weight and a weight weight on a ring.
Do you have a strict plane in your bed instead of a summier?
Never!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night.
Nevertheless, equip the table (if there is none) of aerions and use the stairs with a minimum height of 15cm with sachets (of German Taschenfederken) and an aerial box.
A polyuretan mathematical must not be part of a bed of this type.
For latex- or sandwich latex-combined latex and coco-nick-combination are the idea, but it will always be better for you to have a mathematic with more miles, 28 and above, where the lambs are doubled in the bottom of the renal and thus it is possible to regulate the heavyness.
For multiple position mathematics, it doesn't respond to position changes.
Along with the regulation of the heavyness of the lambs, it is also possible to call a bearing.
It is a special binding of the lambs that allows even to press the lamb so that the "integree" beep of the sleeper is well.
For men who have "the hangs as large as the back", it is really a important thing.
This thing is already intended by the mathematical manufacturers who for "maculins" began to use a covering area at the level of the shoes.
But they also think about women -- they offer them a more molecular surface at the level of the hanches.
For the most difficult customer there are sticks with wings or plastics with what is called a multi-force suspension.
Pression spreads in more points and decreases the pressure.
But, of course, attention, as you use a bad orealer (great and broken air) on good maths and summers, the "master" was disappearing.
The basic rule is a simple oryller: the orealer must support the head and its points must only reach the ears, so that the muscles of the ears can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that the Scandinaves by exmple prefer.
When it is extended on the side, the wheeler must update the height of the wheel (with the cover of the top or the rammo zone in the matlas).
Modern mathematics still have something common with the first basic pair and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or many mixtures.
The trend is also to bio mathematics.
The oil-based materials, from which polyuretan is manufactured, are replaced by natural oil, such as soja oil.
Almost all manufacturers with own use soja.
"The quality Bio for mathematics means that the heart is manufactured based on natural products," explains Peter vasicek of the Tropico Plus company.
Natural materials are also used for mathematical clothing; one of the first was the real alalae.
But there can be microcapsules that develop perfs of the forest or of the forest.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the extract of bowl plants to absorb the heat and refrigerate the body, "refrided" the man, the clothes "heating" women.
The extreme of red powder accelerates blood-eating and therefore is heavyer for weak sex.
Current preferences?
The mathematics produced from cold muscle (he has more pores with a cellular structure, therefore, more respiratory than the standard polyurethane and has more flexibility.
The combination of different rigidities of cold mouse gives polyzone matures that know exactly where the head is, the bottom of the back and the feet.
You'll pay a quality math from 7000 corners and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less than TVA and are taken as health tools.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached the first place.
Economy for mathematical and summier is not simple.
It may be timely to have in special actions by manufacturers or producers for the price of one.
As for example, the Magniflex company who offers mathematics Duofre with memory mouse Mem -- used to cloth for 11990 corners.
Of course, the second can be taken freely.
The era of persecuted or viscoelastic mouse with a open cell structure and a large spacing has been started with the material Tempor at a "cosmic" rythm.
This started as a material for NASA because the astronauts were at the start of large load factors.
The time is low to the heat, and it is hard, rather, to the cold.
So he is perfectly adapted to the hot human body and distributes him a optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against bad sleep and for an increase in comfort during the sleep.
Viscoelastic muscles are not only used for matures but also for health products, such as special cousin for feet lifting the feet and the vein system.
Czech manufacturers, for example, use the EucathermC or Twinsaver mouse or the same type.
The equipment to follow people are more asking for parents who want to monitor their children.
Further fear for their children has brought more people to think of watching them through a GPS.
The system, located at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to track people's movement and help for some cases such as the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as an aluminium bottle but will soon be the size of an hour.
The case of the little Anicka embedded a lot of people and they started looking for ways to protect their children better.
Even if the price is to hurt their private life.
"We strive to tell everyone that it is not a spinner but only another way to reduce the probability that there is another tragedy," Peter Pilin of the MAcro Weil company, who is one of the trace equipment providers on the Czech market.
"I acknowledge that there may be cases of bad use of such devices, such as put it into the sack of a person who is not at the core, but I have not met such cases yet."
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons, Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes the "bottle" is used and how to use it in case of emergency.
The Psychology for Children, Dana Bockova, draws attention that if the child doesn't want to bring a thing of this type on him, he's going to delay it.
"And even the smallest can show great creativity when it is to be exhausted from something when they don't want to be controlled."
"Portable phones, which can cut up like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long expectations," Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of agression is very discreet.
"If this is a prepared rapt, the author will do everything so that the child doesn't have a electronic device that can locate it."
"It's now the phone."
"When the tracking equipment are developed, they (the raisers) will also seek them because the sale will be supported by a public campaign."
"In such cases, the police will always be in progress," said the psychologist.
It admits the same as such devices can help in a non-prepared agression by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the RC Monitoring Society, who offers tracking services both for cars and people, claims that having this type of apparatus can help, even if it has been destroyed in the case of agression.
"The device may be set up in a regular emission after a specified period."
"If the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
'The most dear devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and seems to be in a long position without moving,' says Cech.
According to him, smart phones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after formating it with a special software.
The problem of the current tracking systems is that it is an apparatus similar to those wearing the size of an aluminium box or the smallest phone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the Macro Weil Society, tests are currently conducted to make devices that reveal common digital times.
"This will have the advantage that the potential agressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Oh, he will take account after a certain time, which will give the police a little more time," he said.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of bracelet or elective, it will always use the same as to track cars.
This is a combination of a GPS-capacity system (which is used corely in autonavigation) and a mobile phone function that warns the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonants that she could take the tour of the Czech Republic with, but she can only hold two years.
The army bought for 445 km of rains used for explosives.
Last year, the Defence Minister had bought it 224 km.
The army has therefore reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the duration of life of the corners is between two and four years.
The army bought detonants to the anonymous STV Group company for 40 million crowns.
The General Major has given it as a reason for the purchase of a huge quantity of detonants to MF DNES that soldiers use it 60 km per year.
According to the reservation calculations made by the pyrotechnics of the army, which MF DNES has contacted, it appears that even the generals, officers with a command, secretary or employees should have an exercise of explosives each year.
Alexandre Vondra, Defence Minister and Vlastimil Picek, military commander, does not make exception.
Only to argument the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonants.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the reserves of the army could be undertaken for 10 years.
If, in contrast, it would be true that for the basis of each of the new professionals it provides for more than 2 m detonants, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has assured - with the consumption of special units and genius - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the quick intervention brigade recently complained to the Minister Vondra that they had almost no munitions for their poing weapons and that the threshold meetings were limited due to the needs of money.
We're not talking about the lack of body linch.
"And I don't take my head if they buy a big amount of detonators with us."
"And that's their decision, and they really know what they do."
"For us the army is a good customer we strive as traders to satisfy," says the STV Group Group director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, the Defence Minister's port-order, argues the purchase of a hundred miles of detonators by the fact that the army will have these "munities" for 10 years.
Yan Decky of the STV Group, however, states only four years of life of detonators and only two-year police and military pyrotechnics.
"If they are perfectly involved in the deposits, it can go up to four years," said the two who don't want his name to be taken into account the criticism of the army.
The past life duration, each municipality must be tested to see whether it remains integral and does not threaten the soldier's life.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the Ministry is a rabai due to the amount of 445 km detonant brains.
"They cost us 60 per cent less than the delivery of the last year of 245 km," indicates the Pejsek password, which is the opinion of the Buyers of the Defence Minister.
Only for comparison: the annual consumption of the detonators of the police's pyrotechnics who neutralize the municipalities of the Second World War or those after the Soviet Army is not exceeding 1500 meters.
And the police always commands the amount of municipalities to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for pirotechnical security reasons and for more flexible ability of the types of more modern and more reliable detonators.
The Defence Ministry has today big problems to neutralize tens of tons of municipalities from the time of Varsovia when the strong Czechoslovakian army of two hundred thousand men was prepared to move, head on the Rhin.
What it expects for a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralizing hundreds of miles of detonant old boilers that it buys today "good market".
To this day, I enjoy contacts that I have received thanks to the concurrence.
The fresh sale of his hotel helped Lucas Pytloun for the winner place of the concurrence of the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the concurrence of the best individual entrepreneur for the past year was Lucas Pytloun, 28-year entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lucas Pytloun loved voager.
And in the foreign, he realized that in Liberia there was no quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his economy on what he had won when he worked in the foreign and with a loan, he bought a small inconvenience of 5 half demoli apartments.
Aware that he was still studying in the third year of higher studies, it was a courageous action.
"The report between the quality and the price of a housing in our region gave me a desire to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began to praise the first rebuilt apartment to the foreign ovs.
He reinvests the benefit in the immobile that he transformed into pension with 54 beds.
Since that moment, his entrepreneur action allowed him to open 4 pensions in Liberec, two restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of approximately 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was too recently the four stars Pytloun hotel design.
This year, he has experienced another similar quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our conception of franchise and other candidates to the Pytloun hotel franchise," the number 1 of the businessmen of the past year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the implementation of a large-scale hotel, the victory at the concurrence of the year's undertaking was well used, Pytloun.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberia and its areas.
"The people had me in the streets, often congratulated me, and, I have to say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
He recommends participating in this concurrence to all who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be → is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge until today that he couldn't have done any other way.
"I started regularly maintaining trade relations with those I met through the concurrence.
According to him, the rename to success also affected employees.
And he has about 70.
"I note the loyalty and proudness of being involved in something that has been generally recognized."
"This is not, and far away, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us.
"Only my name is moved forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I want my follower a better year than that we had in Farmet.
The effort of the victory was replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind himself.
He who came to seek the price in Slovansky dum for the first place of the concurrence for the Year's Company organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury repeated the efforts with which he transformed a tool rental at Ceska Skalice into a firm of 100 million crown business number.
'I can say that the reaction has not only encouraged my own owners and has increased our trust in myself to fight competition," says the winner of the concurrence last year today.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet society there was the desire to do something useful.
And thus, when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to praise the small hotel as compensation after the confiscation of goods by the staff, he did not have a long time, he had a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some friends around his father for the manufacture of plastic bathrooms.
Not long after they started specializing themselves in plant oil presses.
It became the largest manufacturer of automatic pressures in Central Europe after eight years.
The company was even known in the non-specialised public after the success of the concurrence through media.
"Not only our clients started to know the Farmet mark, but also the foreign partners who began to realize that they were with a company who had the greatest success in its country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year was not only in Farmet in the euphory of the victory.
The company's assessment had been made from the 2008 economic results and part of 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
In the highest of the crisis, which did not really touch the citizens, the companies were obliged to stop their investment projects and to begin to limit their purchases of new materials and materials.
"We haven't obviously escape from this situation."
"The business numbers have fallen from 40 percent, and we should have limited our production and even licensees," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A sustainable company must know that timely measures should be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained beneficial results even if they were less than those before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre with the funds, strengthened the presentation of the company in international exhibitions rooms and won the main resources in national exhibitions," Zdarsky said.
Everything allows us to think that the crisis is behind them.
The number of employees also increases the number of employees.
"A new winner I want this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," Karel Zdarsky said.
The investigation that eliminates injured regulations.
The investigation on the Absurdity of the year is for the fourth time part of the case clan.
Some absurd regulations could be deleted.
The lack of glorious winner of this year of the Year Absurdity Question was the obligation to provide in the offices of documents that the officers can offer on-line.
More than the third of the 4000 voters voted for this.
For example, social business administration requested a paper extraction from the trade register while the officer can take it in two mouse clicks.
it changes through the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer ask for the extent of the trade register for insurance payments," Jana Buranova, the Czech Social Insurance Administration's password (CSSZ).
All regulations and decrees that companies and undertakers must comply with in Czech Republic and remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this concurrence of the year's absurdity.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even a greater popularity.
If the last year, 3000 voters have manifested themselves, at least 4000 have voted in this year.
And this is not surprising, there are the most different obligations in our country that make the company free, and, in addition, more.
"We may have the number of documents to be fulfilled for tax declarations on the first places in the world," Karel Havlicek said of the Association of Small and Media Enterprises and Undertakers of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of enterprise activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, the situation in Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the world bank, the Czech Republic is at the 74th place in relation to the conditions for the company, or 8 places more than the last year.
The concurrence of the Absurdity of the year was placed for the first time in 2006 and continued the same scenario each year.
Anyone who can state administrative and bureaucratic absurdities each year from April to the end of September, the last time before the concurrence is closed.
To report the website www.firmaroku.cz, then the concurrence officer chooses seven candidates for the "antiprix" and allows the public to vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that received the largest number of votes is declared winner.
Until the last investigation of the last year, it is a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and discoveries that have lost their sense of existence.
Notes are sent by undertakers, but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the concurrence, therefore, among the nameds, the obligation to carry out autoways and quick roads is to pay the piages, or even the employees with twenty employees are two offices and two toilets each two years.
the list of seven proposals is made on the concurrence site.
The advertising of the concurrence, which always begins at the beginning of November on the Place Venceslas in Prague, is a part of an event that regularly participates in political and political personalities.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodava, director of the Association for Small and Media Enterprises of Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Czech Commerce Chamber, assisted at the time of the concurrence.
"The economic prosperity cannot work when the State puts appeals in the feet of undertakers and for that my goal is to eliminate at least three decades of paragraphs that make the enterprise complex today," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister for Industrie and Commerce.
The effort to remove absurd decretes is not a sword shot in the water.
In 2007, it was not pleasant to people that undertakers were obligation to declare three days before the office for the individual undertaking in the place where the company is located, the purpose of go to an exhibition or a station.
This obligation was deleted with the amendment to the Law on the Individual Undertaking.
The second most plebiscited obligation in 2007, which was to declare to the Work Office a service travel for a foreign employee for 30 days, was deleted with the Law text on what the Green Card is called.
And it's all right until the third session of the concurrence.
The absurdity of 2009 was the decree for physiotherapeuts that they had a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This has been changed by the Ministry of Health last year the obligation to have a refrigerator has been deleted.
A new category repeats the socially responsible firms.
The projects are evaluated, humanitarian, training, or even sports.
The newness of this year of Hospodarske Noviny's concurrence, which already exists for 5 years, is the category called the Company Responsible for 2010.
The responsibility of this concurrence is support for the reasonable and just company.
"We want to support companies monitoring the impacts of their company on the environment and carrying socially responsible activities," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional phone operator, Vodaphone firm, which is the guarantee and promotor of this concurrence, as in the case of concurrence for the revolt of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the 2010 firm's concurrence, organized by Vodaphone, enterprises who did not succeed with one long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the subject of their company is different, their support and prospecting activities can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, this concerns persons handicaped and personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic, there are no examples of Prague Prological Society and Netera who support the creation of informal sport teams of their employees who then participate in a number of tourists in various sport disciplines.
Another example of firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company who is 17 years old the main contributor to the dotation fund that sponsors the infant children.
In order to take care of employees with health problems, it is also possible to cite the Old Paper Manufacturer of Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent, and for this reason has received the title of the Company Responsible for the Central Bohemia Region and which has been placed third in the region in the Concurrence of the Year Company organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomo_, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who has won for introducing suspected working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours per week and, without, proportionally, decreasing the salary.
The jury also devoted her title because she purchased in priority to Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyen activity in the nearby environment and cares about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as far as possible so that our business and administration have at least a impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the ex-effective Society guide.
IT Company responsible Inlogit from the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set them for each mobile holder a chain and a keyboard, encourages their homework and uses the catering services of a local protected company for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow that helps the local Rome community," Ondrej Suchy said the representative of the society.
The last range also includes a Lavage and cleaning company of Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retired insurance of its employees in the form of bonus above standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, qualifications and pleasure," Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal Czasch Construction Society, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically registered in the Responsible Society Category, all regional finalists for the Concurrence of the Vodaphone Company, who had responded to the questionnaires in a joint part of the registration document and returned it to the concurrent before 15 to 1 January.
The wrong-fill or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the competitor.
"If the representatives of the school firms did not respond to questions, they could not participate in the Company's Company's Company, but were not disqualified by the "principal" Company of Vodaphone.
"Independent inscriptions are not possible because it is a subcategorie of the main concurrence of the Year's Company," Karel Goldman of the Bison and Rose Organizational Agency.
In the Plzen Earth Fund, the police was arrested during a public concurrence
In the building of the Earth Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police has been arrested in the last days.
The detectives passed the mines to the local undertaker and traded in the real estate Lubos. G.
He tried to manipulate just an appointment of public offers for the regulation of a refund request so that the proposed area was obtained by a specific candidate.
He had to pay to Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the purpose, I can only confirm that the police continues a person for initial crime in the framework of a call and a public concurrence." said for the journal Righto, the Chief of the Plzen Antonie Zelena Park, knowing that it is prohibited to provide more explanations because the query is current.
After 24 hours, the police reported that undertaking at 46 years of freedom.
In order to know how he could influence a public concurrence, it can only be considered such a few official information.
In a question of Righto, the Portal of the Lubomira Cerna Territory Fund stated that the police were actually arrested in Plzen on a separate workplace and, during the public concurrence.
"He acted with a customer and in no cases of an employee," she explained.
The public concurrence · Cerna has the true name "Place to propose rights for the transfer of lands" and is established when several benefiting candidates are shown.
"These people propose, in the framework of the call, a higher value of their rights to restitutions that must be regulated before the value of the land has been dealt with."
"Subject to the rights proposed for a classification of purchasers, the Territories Fund then transfers the land to the person who has proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund's password.
Lubos G. had, as it was, information about persons who had been registered in the call and as itself, also a benefiting person because he had bought a large number of refund rights, he had proposed the candidates in the field to not participate in the concurrence.
And he suddenly was involved by the fact that he was back.
What would explain why he had so many money in his own possession at the time of his interpellation.
Lubos G. had large contacts above the standards of the FdT (Fonds of the Territories).
It was in the case of FdT Vaclav Sankot's ex-Chefe, who was continued in the penalty for editing areas for which the decision to establish a construction had already been edited.
Just Lubos G., for example, had obtained areas for the construction of communications, particularly in place and place where access art was to be built to the industrial area of Borske Pole.
Later he exchanged it with the mairi for a building in the historical center of the city whose value is very far above.
The mairi was obliged to accept because otherwise it was able to put the building in danger by blocking the lands.
The households will pay an addition of a hundred crowns monthly for the accommodation.
The households will have to pay a supplement from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and asylum, heating supplies and in some places the loans will also increase.
Thus, from January, the families will have to get from their port-monnage up to a hundred cents of crowns monthly more than now.
Electiveness increases 4.6 percent, nearly 2 percent lower gas, in certain locations you must pay up to a decade more water supply and in many places the central heating supply will also be more dear.
Electionality should be born for households in apartment of 100 crowns annually more than currently.
However, all providers have decreased the election prices since the sensitive development of renewable energy production, including photos.
The gas increases moderately but, of course, at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
It is therefore possible to count a hundred more corners.
Although election and gas increase throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating is different from city in the city.
These are mainly the biggest commons planning prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating nearly 50 crowns per month, and the families of Liberia pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague, a increase of 9 per cent is prepared for water and sanitation for the case where the city increases infrastructure lowers.
If the lowers do not change the plague, they will pay a addition of 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague will still be part of the lowest comparison with the whole country.
In the North Bohemia, where prices are already part of the highest, water and sanitation increases by 7.4 per cent.
The rental prices will, for example, increase sensitively in the 450 thousand apartments in location from January, that is, at the end of the regulation.
For example, the CPI Byty company who has nearly 2500 apartments in Usti na Labem decided to increase up to 100%.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in laws will be translated before the courts by the company.
Regular loans that people pay in nearly 300 000 apartments could increase by 10 per cent next year.
Czech kids are swimming in the rhum and the fernet. The beer is no longer mode and acts doodly.
Fernet, rhum, wodka and in exceptional way also the best whisky mark is stolen to parents.
These are drinks that most often have been brought to those who are swimming, who have not yet 15 years of age, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are concerned at the hospital for recidives do not make the exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who face cases similar to the admission of children's hospital departments.
"Beer or wine are no longer modes because it needs time to be saoul."
'The trend is really to strong alcohols', indicated for the Righto Ludek Pel日, Chief of the Children's Hospital Department of Horo in Central Bohemia.
"When they succeeded to hip a papa bottle in the armor, it's sometimes whisky but it's the fernet and wodka that prevalent."
"The wodka has this benefit that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus do not feel it," explains the Department's Boss.
Eva Jurinova, speaker of the Motol Hotel, also gives him reason.
"In general, it's of rhum or fernet."
"This is today the alcohol in the mode, especially in the elementary schools."
"In some cases, it acted with slivo that they returned from the house," Jurinova said.
According to the Department Boss of Pélikan, see drunk children of 13 to 14 years of age to admission to the hospital is a normal phenomena.
Before working in Horo _BAR_ since last year, he was in Motol, where he exercised ten years just in pediatry, where ambulances brought high schools of the entirely drunken surroundings.
"A young girl was so hospitalized four times
" She started her career at twelve years when she was brought with 3.5 for a thousand alcohol in the blood with a mixture with extasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
She was at the Holeso Expositions Park at a party.
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter is 48 hours away," says the Department's officer.
It is just the disinteress of parents or their tolerance outside the community because their rejections are the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
However, the specialists say that there is no strictly dependence on children.
"On the alcoholic vocabulary, a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years is heard with all the phénomènes that deal with it, but not with children."
"For those who use the recreation acool, it is rather a social-family background significantly defavorable," explained the Department Department of Pélikan.
According to Jurinova's password, approximately 40 drink children were hospitalized this year until half November in the Motol pediatry clinic.
Only in the statistics are included with a grew inxication that requires hospitalisation.
Drink children who are after emergency cares brought to them by parents or police are not counted.
Besides the cases of children sitting and drinking a bottle of alcohol after the oil, it exits Pélikan three seasonal waves with which we can count: the day of the stars, the Holy Silvestre and the end of the school year.
"If they drink, despite bad results, they feast the start of vacation."
"I've certainly seen at the day of the girls a 7 drinking children at one time," Pélikan highlighted.
The drunk child who passed the night at the hospital in desintoxation under medical control is paradoxally in better position than he who came back to him and suffers the next day of the "house goal".
The head pains of the morning caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by infusion of glucose and nutritional elements that need the need for.
"They're better lotis for this because they're going to pass a great evening, then a mild wake up and nothing doesn't hurt them."
"They are just surprised from the place where they are," Pélikan says, knowing that at the time, it breaks the good humor of the patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalisation on intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of corners.
"In time, I applied this as a means of education by counting these children how much their drinks were costed and that they could pass the whole sea in the sea to restore one evening," Pélikan said.
However, the health insurance companies in their regression management, which should recover care-related charges from parents, do not treat the cases of drinking children.
Two aircraft L-159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five aircrafts L-159, against which the Defence Ministry has exchanged aircraft Casa C-295M, found on Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer is located.
It's the first time this type's devices become the property of someone else than the Czech Army.
However, they were in the foreign in the field of exercises or demonstration flights.
It is biplace versions of L-159T1 which were still in service in the Czech Army and who were in a flight state.
Remaining devices are monolocal versions of L-159.
These state for the instant of the Aéro Vodochody and the commercial mediator - Omnipol - took account of them last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Department of Presidence of Defence, Vodochody's airport is for the unknown intention.
"L-159 planned airports have been taken on long-term aircrafts without providing additional charges or investments for the Defence Minister."
"The L-159 T1 biplaces have been changed in the state," he said for Righto Pejsek.
He played that the army would not remain free because the Ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement of a value of 200 million crowns for the transformation of four single places L-159 unused in two biplaces.
The army took a delivery of the first equipment in July, the second for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, aircraft was committed to introduce in the equipment of certain countries of the Alliance.
"In the contract, it is indicated that the person who takes account of the L-159 aircraft is EADS and that they will serve to entering NATO's pilots."
"It is therefore the case of a person who takes account of determining how to do this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced, a while ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa airport and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was entered by the Government of Mirek Topomanek last year.
The Defence Minister has not launched a call for offers and directly contacted EADS.
The defence direction argued while the exchange provides for future exports from L-159 to the foreign.
The Czech Army purchased 72 equipment at Aero Vodochody and only used 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of aeroplanes Casa will probably have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has made a complaint against the Czech Defence Ministry at the Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been chosen in the framework of a European scale calling for offers and, in no case, directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken a delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last should come on the Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the cancellation is a low risk sign of cancer
Men who have the longer index than the cancellation are exposed to a less risk of having a prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a Wednesday study by the British magazine Cancer.
This can depend on the level of the hormone meat the testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger is a simple test of prostat cancer risk, especially for men before 60 years," announced the collaborator of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Research on Cancer at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help to determine which men should be subject to the test of prostate cancer, in particular by combining with genetic risk or other aggressive factors such as family health anticipations, has Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed more than 1500 patients with a prostate cancer and at the same time approximately three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the cancellation.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of a cancer of prostate.
However, in the case of those who had the longer index than the cancellation, the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before 60 years, the risk reduction reached 87 per cent.
The report of the length of both cited fingers - formed during the prenatal period - indicates particularly different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless of testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Experiencing research has shown that it is just the testosterone that helps develop a prostate cancer.
Professor Vaclaées, Czech Genetic, renamed and former President of the Scientific Academy, said for CTK that he is at the core of this study but that he does not, it seems, that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 authors are closed.
Czech, as most of Europe, is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On the roads and trottoirs, most of the compressed snows have worked all night in many places.
D5 is closed the morning between the 89th and the 9th miles in direction of Rozvadov due to several trucks and car accidents and the D1 road to Brno in the direction of Prague is the same.
The UAMK's headquarters told it to the information
In the 91th miles, a truck was accidental, and at the 93th two heavy weights, it was hurt.
Several cars have also been found in the foxe.
The problems are also on the D1 to 185 miles in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks were over there.
The drivers should go straight after Brno at 190 km or go through Brno and then enter the 182 km to Kyvalka.
A row of cars of several kilometers was developed in this place.
Moreover, on D11, there is an accident and, just at the army in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow bed of several meters of snow, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, car rows are created in Prosek, the Sterboholska street is also bound.
The safer transport means is the meter.
The tramways take delay, for example, on the line between the Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and the Place of Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight hours in the morning, the major crisis state in Prague must still be gathered.
Iron roads and airports also face problems.
Czech railways have already had to be removed due to snow 7 quick links.
Lines for example from Prague in Kralupy or many of Prague in Beroun have problems
Travellers should control the current situation.
The Ruzyne airport has been closed since Friday 11:00 at night to 5 hours in the morning.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rollable, but by doubling care.
On the way of Vyskov, three side roads are inappropriate, on the road of Brno it begins to have places of snow rafels and on the road of Blansko the chains are obligatory to pass some ways of communication in the higher places.
The Vyskov region was part of the most touched places.
Until now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Mileso
To clean them, it may be necessary to send snow and snow fresh.
We can't appreciate instantly when they will be rollable.
On the Road of Hodonin, the Dance is rigorous in the white Carpates region.
On the roads that, in view of the protection of nature, only undertaken by the aspersion of inert products, there is also a 5-meter snow bed warned CTK.
In Czechland it fell between two and 10 metres of snow; it fell most in the North Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 meters of snow.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, it fell up to 15 meters of snow.
Injury was gradually disappeared in Czech Republic.
The Americans have a new "intelligent weapons"
The American army sent a new "intelligent" weapon to Afghanistan only known under the XM-25 code name.
Generals think that this new automatic fusil will affect the conflict there with the Talibans and "will change the game" to their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise canon
His projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
Special calibration munitions of 25 mm developed for this fusil and containing a highly brilliant explosive, actually works as small grass.
Municipalities can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but to any of their balistic travellers.
So it can be used against an enemy who is hidden behind an obstacle, a wall or a foot.
It is not also protected from above and when it falls on a murderous rain of steel lats, it can also make it out of fighting.
According to Richard Audette, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new fusil is the first infantery weapon that uses the "intelligent".
"The soldier uses it primarily in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser radius that determines the distance, thus gets a specific point of view, which he corrects his site and supports the detention.
"Disons you've seen 543 meters."
"When you press the detention, the army loads and shoots 543 metres more or less than 1, 2, 3 meters, stated Audette.
400 dislocalized jobs
The Fujitsu group departs his Bad Homburg branch to France.
The next year in July, 400 persons will transfer their jobs to Astro Park that are currently located in the Mareinbader Place in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu deployed his Bad Homburg summer in Francfort.
As it stated on Wednesday, the specialised gentleman in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, the next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, which is still on the location of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a large complex office in the street Lyoner Street of the Quartier Niederrad de Francfort.
A portfolio of Fujitsu explained that the group should in the middle-term group group 100 other jobs still in the region.
The location offer was extremely attractive. Moreover, Astro Park's open air offices are better agreed to the workshops.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu was just a placeholder.
The Director-General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Nederrad is a primary place for us with an excellent infrastructure."
It claims that the connection to the airport is just a major importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new deployment of a major enterprise within the region has raised the joy of the winners yesterday and caused the deception of perseverance.
The responsibility for the economic affairs of the Francfort municipality, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is a "extraordinary faith profession in the place of implantation".
Fujitsu suitable for the city and its implantation is an important elephant for Niederrad.
The Master of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the green) regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The direction has soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"He will without saying that we have proposed our aid to this business," Mr. Korwisi said.
However, friendly relations would have nothing able to change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer to the owner of the Place Marienbader.
Finally, the economic reasons would have been determining.
It is now to avoid that such a exceptional place remains unemployed for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and widespread of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the impression of the Place of the Hotel de City, used by Fujitsu and the "small vertical" neighborhood, and the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, was part of the controversy construction project of the thermal station.
The fruit of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new input from the city was created between the tower and the city Hotel, which produces many criticisms, not only because of the impressive alignment of surfaces that would be previously in part of the parking, but also because of the height of the immobile.
In 2001, the banking company and investment advice, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, manufacturer of computers at the time still associated with Siemens, took place in immobiliary.
In 2006, the German Francfort's Specialized Group Immobilien-Chancen sold the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as Morgan Stanley's real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were returned to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group whose seat is in Tokyo is viewed as the third largest provider of computer products worldwide.
For example, it provides computers and servers for businesses and also provides essential services.
Its contribution in the Rhin-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu is of course more than employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to install in Frankfurt-Nederrad. The other branches presented in this site are Fujitsu Services and a TDS company.
For this, 7000 square meters have been located in the Astro Park Impuls.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name reminds his plan in the form of a star, includes the seat of the Conference of the Electrotechnical and Electrotechnical Industrie.
Server exemption by Amazon - threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks tests more and more difficulties.
The Internet Service Provider Amazon expelled the specialized site from its servers in the revelation of confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressures after the publication of the hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, appears to live in letters.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is always more forced.
The Wikileaks Cyber-activist group has no access to his hosted server until here in America and now seeks a hotel in Europe.
During this time, the American Eminent Senator, Joe Lieberman, called the other countries and companies to boycotter Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is searched by Interpol, probably resides in Great Britain, the information provided by journals.
"Wileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freety of expression in the country of freedom" indicated Wednesday (local time) Cyber-activists from the origin of revelations through the Twitter social network.
Shortly before, the Cyber company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, Cyber-activists had access to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the largest number of documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent to take care of people in Europe."
When the freedom of expression is a problem in Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN TV chain, quoting Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon prohibited Wikileaks to use his servers after the investigation carried out by Senator Joe Lieberman Senator.
The Chairman of the Senat Committee on Territory Protection threatened the Amazon site to orchestra a boycott against it, reported the British Journal The Guardian.
"I would like Amazon to take this measure before with regard to the publications of the classified information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Similarly, Mr. Liebermann invited the other countries to guard the use of servers through the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrously and without scrupules. This makes our national security in danger and in danger of life throughout the world," an independent senator.
"A conscientious company of its responsibilities, whether or not American or foreign, should not help Wikileaks spread the contents of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, which is searched by the Swedish authorities because he is suspicioned of violence, is listed in the list of people searched by Interpol.
According to the information published by the Londres 'The Independent', the 39-year-old Australia lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where it is.
Cyber-activist continued to qualify for anxieties orchestrated by its detractors the persecutions committed to it by Sweden.
The Wikileaks portfolio, Christinn Hrafnsson, said to London that threats were prophesyed against the site.
"Calls were even made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is particularly afraid of his security, said Hrafnsson.
That's why Wikileaks' founder also continues to hide himself.
Hrafnsson was manifestly responsible for the statements made in North America.
In America, the ancient Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested that the responsible for the revelations made by Wikileaks be continued and exempted for trade.
In Canada, the Governing Boss of Mr. Stephen Harper said to the television, evidently ironicly, that Mr. Assange should be killed and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone".
Pen held this time, a polymetic started between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, Mr. Barack Obama's portfolio of the American President, qualified for "ridicule and absurd" the fact that Mr. Asange requested the demission of the State Secretary of Hilary Clinton if it was responsible for the order given to the diplomates, and recently spread up to a campaign.
"I don't know exactly why we must take care of the opinion of a owner of a website," Mr. Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the statements of a website."
The US Government now has completely been testing the protection of its databases.
According to a white householder, Mr. Travers, assistant director of the Centre of Anti-Terrorism, was appointed responsible for fighting the refugees.
Mr. Travers is loaded to establish "the necessary reforms" which are essential after the divulgation of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to verify the ways that the whole administration exchanges and protects information.
Furthermore, the US Government announced that he wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and military soldiers if they were never threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We have done everything to contact them," Philip Crowley stated the portfolio of the State Department.
"We are ready to protect them if it is necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" of Bologne, ice confissors are prepared for the best season of the year.
The three-day initiative course organized for future iceers has been very successful and attracted from visitors coming from everyone.
In fact, where's the whole ice from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The ice, which is in German, is a little demodified ice conspirator, manufactures the creme; all the rules of the Italian ice art manufacturing.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated vitrine using a spatule, disposes in the left and then starts to sell it.
To know that, we do not need to go to Anzola della Emily in the province of Bologne.
But whoever wants to know more about ice can not avoid "Gelato-Unicy" from the Italian Carpigiani firm.
The sorbiters manufacturer founded the ice university in 2003 so that ice creme out of its machines responded to high Italian ideals.
The initiative course of three days organized for future iceers has been very successful and attracted from visitors coming around the world.
They are also offered special courses on chocolate ice and are spent for several days, and practical meetings are organized in private ice.
In the full crisis of the 40th, a number of people dream of a new career, others are simply risked to make their burning desire on the ice island.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents from Brazil to Saudi Arabia by Hungary.
Jacky, artistic education teacher coming from California, is free of Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a European quality product in the country of the Industrial Glass in the future.
Anke de Berlin is a adviser in business management and wants, after a few years, to take a few things to unite this testing work for the nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream to open a glacier in Cairo.
A man originating from Malta and another coming from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian family woman came because her children loved the Italian ice creme.
The ice master Luciano Ferrari explains the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
It is determining not only the good salt, but also the sweet flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget the cereal on the chat of the national superstructure and generally from the south: "The Italian ice is just the best: and then it still keeps a sacred dose of romantics."
The first step in the manufacture seems to be simple.
Luciano pays the basic ingredients, such as milk, chrome, milk, sugar powder and stabilisers in a large mixer that hits up to 85 degrees by means of a electronic program and then immediately refrigerates at four degrees.
Then it opens a robot installed on the machine: there is a pasteurized white base cream, based on all types of ice for milk.
The formatter is quickly questioned: Is it possible to produce ice using only natural substances without stabilising?
How can we give free course in personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano is watching the fact that he is allowed to be induced in error by the mind of the time.
He who speaks only of "fabricated from natural ingredients" ice may have been used by stabilisers: most often a natural product, such as the well-fabricated grain meat obtained from the health haricot.
It is obviously possible to manufacture ice without using stabilisator, only you need to sell it within 24 hours, elsewhere, and the client will cross nothing but ice granules.
Some changes in the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more passionate with the aromas.
The Master Luciano sets the difference between the ingredients that are obtained in the supermarket's fruit or confiseries radiation.
Moreover, there are powder and powder.
"The suppliers will all try to replace you with dozens of aromatized inhibitors."
"Always, you should just try."
Or in the recepts of fruit sorbits with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or in ice creams manufactured from white base mass which, by eggs, becomes a yellow cream and, when cacao powder, constitutes the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must go to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them in time to produce four types of ice: to vanille, chocolate, moka and noise with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanille aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different species of ice for fruit are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more pure fruit: from the point of view of go, it is not absolutely better.
Ice to noise doesn't necessarily behave the go of the noise when it is composed in a large part of noise.
The ice for kiwi, very popular, is manufactured from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilising.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly reveals the go of ice," says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation exercise: if fishing cleaning is used with a lot of sugar, the quantity of sugar should be reduced in the basic receipt.
An addition of sugar is required for ice to citron.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of various types of fruit (the winners use it to measure the grape of Oechsle in the rain mode).
Fortunately, tables easily calculate.
The ice production is no longer required, as previously, of such intervention.
This is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the basic mass that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the ice mixture is at the same time used to make it low and renewable to negative temperatures.
Despite all automatications, panels are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo is a barrier of pure fruit from the head to the feet and thus slabs his students when the control of the colossal mixer boiling bow escapes him.
Master Luciano believes that a "like incident can occur during each course: it is only a question of time."
Controllers in a ambiguous position
According to certain sources, the industry that experiences the culture of genetic plants has distorted the European Food Safety Authority.
This is now formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered as an independent institution to evaluate the consequences of biotech.
"It sounds like a theory of conspiration, but we are well-known," said on Wednesday at Munich Mr Christoph Then, Testbiotech.
Certain information states that the President of the Efsa Group of Experts for Genetic Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are contracted with the Illi pressure group.
This is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has determined the development of Ephsa test requirements for genetic plants and, in fact, is in a situation of interest, the criticisms formulated by Mr. Then.
The prepared requirements are textually corresponding to the positions taken by the Illi pressing group and thus carry out the mark of the industry which would, at the basis, be controlled by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
It is already the second time Testbiotech states a conflict of interest.
A high range responsible for Efsa has recently joined the Swiss Agricultural Group Syngenta without or without transitional period. It has changed the camp.
A few years ago, even the Radio of Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche; MDR) has revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's control authority and the industrial lobby, which has developed the suspicions of the German Federal Agency for the Environment as well as European Members.
However, Ephsa does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
A opinion indicates that all reliable data are exploited, including the industry's, as long as they are of a good professional quality.
It is not prohibited for experts working for the Ephsa account to contact this sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Institute for Life Sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based on the United States.
This agency is viewed as a neutral forum that groups experts, inter alia, in the field of science, industry and policy, to evaluate the risks of biodiese without becoming lobby sold.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then discover that geneticly accepted plants are accepted without any food tests in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know which are, for example, the genetically caused maïses in the field," says Mr. Then.
Current practice consists of testing only isolated proteins and not all genetic plants, which does not allow reliable results.
"If we are not looking for risks, how can we find them?" Mr.
This is also Mrs Angelika Hilbeck's viewpoint.
This scientist has conducted research in the genetic area since 1994 and currently works in Zurich's polytechnical oil.
In this region as well as in the United States, and now in Europe, the industry's sector is trying to further influence or discriminate critical sciences.
That is why there are almost researchers who are not associated with companies.
Company's opinion that critical studies would not be conducted.
Mrs Hilbeck claims that "the industry controls security research".
The stone trace
Uli Gsell was looking for it, at a total of 400 kg.
Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart's garage with her tube at the back.
There was a man.
He was snow.
The story is known: In September, the excavators were coming and began to demolirate a large part of the north air.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: A number of thousands of people have manifested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central garage into a subterraneous garage that will cost several billion.
A large part of the wheel was in ruins when the manifestation was able to stop the building travels.
Broken in 6000, 7000 songs.
The Muschelkalk (the coqui calcarier) of ́ilsheim, a thin and gross pave is mal built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor in Ostfildern.
It was a few fragments.
"There stones are rest."
"They don't have to disappear."
He says with enthusiasm: "a modest and good market, simple and earthly rock."
He claimed that by cooking her to the science, he felt the odor of the cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do about that fragment yet.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
the traces of Stuttgart's stones lead to an old depth of municipalities from the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rong built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man makes the trade of old stones.
He bought all the stones issued from demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were concassed or disappeared in the decharge," he says in his office in a hot, which was sometimes a guard post.
It is ra_ that he has been subject to insults and threats when the journals reported that he had bought the rest of the north ail to the demolition undertaking.
But he negotiated for all days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything of all to oppose demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project have brought one of the average weighted stone paralleped 80 kg of which the value is between 6,50 and 14 euros.
Some keep it as a memory in all hopes also able to rebuild it.
Rongen had purchased 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still in the forest, and the rest has been sold for a long time.
Gardens owners, landscape gardens, Particulars.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could be able to enter the coffre and remorques.
These scandal stones of Stuttgart have long been transformed into "Mouse" or in limitations of grass-band plates.
"In fact, this stone is nothing particular," Mr. Rongen said.
"It hasn't been this political component."
He enters his car all the country, turns his wide empire of 20 hectares.
He has done right studies that he has abandoned. Later, he entered into studying the biologic before he then was interested in the information and finally become a car.
And a stone amateur.
He stores 40,000 tonnes.
He's getting treasures everywhere in Germany.
HE claims that he is the biggest market of old stones.
He's referring to it.
Sculpted sand stones with art are placed on snow.
"They were part of the Marienbrücke Pont in Dresde."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, confirms it with enthusiasm.
"My preferred stone."
He takes the way that goes through the forest.
It shows a cup of finger: Peter red sand, first, part of Karlsruhe's garage.
And soon.
"Good travertin."
The parallel was already part of the court of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, Cannstatt's travertin from the police prefecture, the red granite from the Santa Blasia Cathedral, the tuf from the Heilbronn Hostel.
What a job, what effort, what anxiety!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were ever sculpted and moved with the help of simple pals and charrets taken by bovine, it becomes very respectful.
"It would be a scandale if such an inheritance was put into the room."
He has not become rich, yet less rich.
But this car is currently employed by 14 people. Moreover, stones, sculptor, forgeron, glass softer and garden have been installed in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's grative," says the recycler of waste.
In fact, it must go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Battle of talents to win the high potential
The account knows a lifeful floor.
16 students boost themselves to buy little bread in the salmon, the suce tooth and white-feeders.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited students in design and mechanical genius to a hotel.
In the context of a kind of idea concurrence, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW conceptors, and knowing the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many enterprises do not want to go to the body in competition to deny better brain and to engage, such as Volkswagen, in a multiformal cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most duly diplomats as possible in the amphithateatres before these finals arrive on the employment market and they are not broken by others.
And since universities do not have statements about the performance of their students, they are trying to find exceptional talents in the context of practical projects and to relieve them.
On the second day of the athleter organized at the Brauschweig Technical University, the car group assaults the talents.
A young lady of the staff service shares the lots, bonbons and cards that include the Volkswagen logo.
It speaks about the calend · professional stages and student jobs to young talents; she shows them the ways to access the group's enemy.
It is Nico Selle of the Braunschweig Technical University responsible for the project involved with Volkswagen.
For him there are reciprocal advantages for both parties: "The students are in contact with this industrial sector and win in experience."
"When the Volkswagen group, he can know the students, look closer to the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into account as a chairman."
According to Mr Selle, such cooperation is important.
What's happening again is the obsessive with which we're trying to draw students.
"Instead, the accent was placed on the professional project," Mr. Selle said.
The fight for the conquest of the new diplomates will become much more open.
In sector goods, enterprises can no longer recruit their employees by performing a series of candidates.
But they must overcome their reliability and especially shorten the highly qualified work hand.
This is especially the diplomatic out of the engineering branches that are in a great position to negotiate.
According to German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 engineers have remained unemployed in October.
And VDI's previsions, the empty position of engineer posts will be increased yet.
Roman Dy's goes to the jail for the KPMG account, audit cabinet, accounting experts and advice.
It organizes valuable events regarding the recruitment of talents, such as the KPMG-Race cross currency, a species of rail paper where competitors need to find their path using GPS coordinates.
The company will therefore send eight promising students in the next year so that they can take the United States in this way.
Participants can accessly visit KPMG branches and know the company.
The person who has to participate in it shall be determined in advance after two choice procedures.
Only the cryme of the creme of many candidates will take place for the United States.
According to Mr Dy, the means used for searching high potential at universities are more important.
"We want to get out of the lot through the cross currency."
"For us, a simple crossière was too little."
For the soldier of talents that is Mr. Dy, the account is there.
"To this day, we have stayed in contact with all people who have participated in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are at the point of finishing their studies and want to address their requests to our business soon."
Outside the direct adoption made in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are currently classic by participating in professional fees where they are delivered to the brain chasing.
"We are trying to reach diplomats by participating in professional rooms."
"For example, in the Sunset Room," indicates Mrs. Sitha Stübe, the Hum resource guide at Solarworld, manufacturer of photographic panels.
This company installed in Bonn works about 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs. Stübe knows the problem associated with the relevance.
Currently, 35 posts are placed at the concurrence site of the company.
"In this moment, it's very difficult to provide vacant posts."
"This costs dear and takes a lot of time," he's sure?
Another way to set the contact is to pass through university teachers.
Solarworld has established a cooperation with various higher educational institutions, for example the Freebourg University.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the possibility of performing professional stages or to write his draft final study at us."
Honourable advertising campaigns are held in the solar specialists.
That is why the company is trying to make its advertising by exercising other qualities: customized environment, platform hierarchy and easy communication.
"A large group can't do this often," Mrs. Stübe, the leader of the staff, supports.
For a long ago, money has no longer played the main role in employment research.
Flexible working hours, children's guards or good promotion opportunities constitute other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld occupies the 55th place among the 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honour table of German employees.
In this regard, he asks the employees about their satisfaction in relation to their work and its context while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
The head of Ms. Stübe's staff hopes that this place will allow the company's image to increase with employment applicants.
"I think candidates are particularly moved to external assessments on a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Re日 Warler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as employee by implementing a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, Mr. Kriegler, this means first to take internal measures.
"The best way for a employee to become attractive is to pass through his own employers," he said.
This is, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, which is the creation of the employment mark image in its own efficiency.
"the satisfied chairers form the best messengers."
When the employees are well treated and they identify themselves with the company, they do the publicity of their employees with their friends and knowledge.
"It's like we were playing in an orchestra," Mr. Kriegler said.
Obama makes a frein to new oil forages
There will be no new oil forages in Mexico golf in the wide coast of Florida, the South East State of the United States, in the next years.
The Government of Washington has proposed a prohibition A equivalent prohibition and, thus, definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even at the width of the Atlantic coast, new forages remain for the intime prohibited.
The Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement Thursday.
This is the explosion, in April, of the "Deepwater Horizon" plateform that is originating in this strict prohibition, which must remain in force for at least five years.
With regard to this accident, which costs the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, subject to the pressure of opposition and the activity sector, indicated that he was willing to authorize the implementation of new forages in the eastern part of Mexico golf.
Participants of this solution would therefore want to reduce the dependence of the United States towards foreign countries for the supply of oil.
The question of knowing who has the responsibility of the devastating black sea in the golf is not, until this day, finally resolved.
The British Oil Group, which is confronted with a number of billion compensation requests, is located in the center of the funds.
A investigation committee established by Obama must submit its conclusions on December.
In October, the secretary at Interior Ken Salazar had raised the ice of the decreed forage after the platform was exploited.
Following this decision, various oil groups had soon submitted requests for new forage projects.
With stricter control measures and more severe security consignments, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent control authority, which has been discreded after a lot of corruption, is currently subject to deep reforms.
Parallelly, Mr Obama announced that they would remove the profitable tax nine of oil and oil groups.
Attorneys in this sector are now watching the fact that the feeding in the golf would be just lower than this until now.
"The goal of the Government is to raise the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector," the result of a current survey carried out in the sector by the BDO audit cabinet before the prohibition of swimming.
Furthermore, American Enery Alliance deploys the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "Nobody knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investment in new support projects has been reported up to a new order, in the deterioration of growth.
The country of Ogoni is dry
The water that covers in the rivers is brun oil; it decreases a smoke similar to that in the essence station: due to a fleeting, billion litres of oil have destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live from flight, corruption and oil raffination.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't kidnappe," the military soldier starts the journalists to calm them: "You're still enough oil bubble before the water lamp today."
The 37-year Nigeria has tried to photograph a young man that was thrown into the bully water to the poitrine, as well as the grass train around it: This scene ≥ almost beautiful in the water late with the color of the arc-in-heaven.
We can't understand that the subsoul is driving brunne oil nappes.
On the edge of Bodo-Jetty's cup, Esther Badom ra's that, jadis, she collected cavetes throughout the ground here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have completely broken.
Five years ago, a huge quantity of oil was thrown from a olive oil exploded in the large sea.
Fisheries in the neighborhood city of Bodo must now take six hours to reach fishing waters: the country of Ogoni in the heart of Delta of Niger is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
All the extent of the ravages runs in the eyes when the mangrove marais are parked through water courses.
Instead of a water, the engine ship finds a cradingue marron water. Whoever puts his hand on it takes away any oil covering.
The rains of the mangrove's little rain are coming out of the ground as rice bottles. Isolated palms lay their palms sadly hang their palms.
We are looking for bird clouds in vain, as we usually meet in humid areas: Until the outside engine stops, a fantomatic silence has fallen on this Paradise of the past, which is responsible to a service station by the odor he takes away.
"What happens here is war against the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent risk of health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni lives is a camp of battle sitting for decades ago: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorators have passed here; the first resistance was organized in 1980 by the Ken Saro-Wiwa Ken. This was exempt later. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because these were very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to Ogoni is prohibited to this society: While more than 2 million black gold bars are pumped daily by more than 5000 pounds of forage and 7000 miles of oil oil in the area of Delta, three times large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are unexploited because the situation is too instable for this oil group.
All around a hundred meters stand in the water of steel trees as bizarre sculptures: "Bracks of Christmas" are very affectingly drawn by the heads of forage.
They are up to 50 years, most of them are rounded by the corrosion until the discovery.
Akpobari believes that the head of this nature falls from time to time in song, because a constant float of brutal oil cool in water.
According to the estimates of experts, more than two billion litres went on the 50 years: each year, the quantity of oil corresponding to the oil that was grown in the sea during the super-petroleum "Exxon Valdez" age 21 years ago in the width of the Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who should be responsible for continuous environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and siphonisation of olive oil are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. The environmentalists for their part consider the explosions of forage heads and perforated olive oil as the main causes.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Ste _BAR_ reproached the Shell group to apply essentially stricter security standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the deficiency rate of conduct is "which is much higher than all".
Some forms of mangroves in a place that, seeing far away, reverses to a abandoned chamber, full of chambers and installed with free air: they are completely naked and covered by chambers to the corner.
A shintile fire under one of the many tonnes that soon connected to tulls, soon sparpilated without reason on the site, must be reperated: a small clandestine raffiny.
We've made the brute oil in the tunnel for several hours, explains Michael, the team head.
In the first time, the essence falls into a recipient by tuyals, then, at the end of the conduct of cherozen rubber falls and finally gets the diesel.
That is how Michael and his four operators produce four f's 300 litres daily: "This reports us 34,000 Naira", about 22 dollars.
The population of Delta is part of the chronic fuel penure in the largest country of oil producer in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one raffination.
Illegal raffiners can sell at a less precious price than that ridiculously lower than 40 centimeter euro per litre of Diesel: Because they are freely buying their first material.
This is offered by the "protectors" which put the olive oil network throughout the Ogoni countries. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million oil litres in the Delta of Niger.
Only a small totally insignificant part of the maintenance is temporarily purified: the networks of organized crime, which also count among its members of high-range politicians and military soldiers, carrying the part of lion in tankers and braking it on the world market.
The Military Akpobari considers that the debate on the question of whether the environmental disaster should be awarded or, rather, subversive activities to the population or the laxist production mode are clearly academic.
"If the oil companies were not considered as intruses and the foundations of fishermen's life were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, neither flights and raffinies."
But, in the meantime, the relationships of Ogoni in particular towards Shell were so deceived that it was no longer question of the retreat of the group. "It may be that the operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, would be better."
So Michael becomes nervous.
"It's great time you're deguerpisting" announces the strong orv of the oil.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If illegal raffinators are surprised by the special units of armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but they will also offer them potters of wine.
Even soldiers from the north of the country are especially able to benefit as all the Nigerians of the primary matter.
"To all the point of view, this fifth thing has caused our country to fall very low," Akpori regrets.
Researchers cover construction failures in the A380 reactions
A380 is obviously suffering from a big security problem.
An examination of an apparatus that has made a emergency attempt, researchers have discovered a possible construction failure that can lead to the "catastrophic deficiency of the reaction".
The Air Company Qantas now wants to make a complaint against the reacter manufacturer.
In the beginning of November, the Airbus passengers belonging to the Quantas company had had even more chance: During the request that it had carried, the Australian air security authority found that the reactions of some A380 devices had a serious security problem, and she cared against a possible construction failure.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it may cause fatigue and fleeting cries at the level of oil conduct association, indicating in a position taken on Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophic deficiency of reactions".
The manufactured Rolls-Royce reacters are concerned and equipped with 20 aircrafts of the A380 series.
The Airbus of Quantas, who had to emerge on 4 November in Singapore, is among these.
The Australian aircraft has now committed Judge Prosecutions against the reacting manufacturer.
It presented a judicial complaint to an Australian Federal Court whose seat is in Sydney, which allows her to take other legal measures against society.
The director of Quantas, Mr. Alan Joyce, stated that his company would claim interests in the incidence of beginning of November.
A few pieces were distracted and the surface was damaged during the engine's burning.
According to Rolls-Royce, this is the inflammation of oil that is originating in degrees.
After this incident, at least 40 reactions must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that other security tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with reactions in question.
Safety recommendations are the result of a Rolls-Royce's employment, indicated the ASTB's password, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his aircraft, the Quantas aircraft had immobilized its entire A380 float for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
Airhansa replaced the reaction of A380 by precautionary measure.
The two-scale airplane is the biggest airline plane in the world.
The fall of snow throughout the territory causes a chaos in transport
Germany covered all white cover: In one night, the snow fell on almost all the country.
Chaos rules on all roads, trains and aircrafts.
At least three persons have died in accidents.
The winter makes grelotter Germany: By iceal temperatures, almost all the Republic is covered by snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many places.
On the north and east, snow covering reaches 15 metres per place.
It is very restricted on several roads and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they couldn't end the snow that did not stop accumulating.
Furthermore, rafalous violents swallowed the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Federal Office of Maritime navigation and Hydrography (DSH) has reached these race-marines with the Baltic Coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels that can reach 1,2 m above the normal.
Snow snows on the autoways and on the federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxe.
That is why the warning center of bad time Meteomedia announced the violated warning level was announced in Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, there were 30 metres of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds have spread.
Several trucks and cars remained there at night.
Even in the land of Saxe-Anhalt, police authorities announced serious disturbances on the road.
On A2, snow and wind caused an interruption of Property and caused bottles.
In Thuringe, snow falls touched the A4 and A9 australies.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious rail traffic disorders have occurred in Saxe, Saxe-Anhalt, Thuringe and north of the Bavière.
The main problems are: the snow on the iron roads, the trees fallen on the railways, cateneries or destroyed hail.
In Saxe, we had to stop the interregional transport of Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, a ICE train at Munich's destination had to interrupt his travel.
The pumps and paramedics had to provide the 165 train passengers in covering, food and drinking.
Snow winds have broken the roads.
The Snow Chutes have caused many flight cancellations in the main airports of Germany.
According to a portfolio of the standard and flight information, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
A Fraport portfolio indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Francfort on the face.
Winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that the passengers at the airport are not more, despite that they are present at least 400 beds.
Events occurred Thursday afternoon on many roads.
On the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost life during a station with a train at a level.
The train driver was wounded.
Because of snow beds presented on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far away from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was packed at a level because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost life.
Four passengers were wounded in the train, so the way from Bayreuth to Nuremberg has been closed until the hours.
Furthermore, a 30-year-old woman died when her car was thrown on a lying shot in Aschaffenburg.
However, the weatherologists announce a good news: Snow will always be mild and dustful, but it will turn on rafhals.
But the wind's going to be lost.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by violent and fast winds.
However, it makes it very cold, up to at least 15 degrees per place.
The Deutsche Bank seeks a buyer for its joint tours.
The Deutsche Bank is trying to separate from its emblem: According to reported newspapers, this financial institution seeks purchasers for two of its officers to his seat in Francfort.
This immobility could report up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just emphasised the group's seat: The joint tours in the Fourth Business have been modernized; while waiting, the bans have had to return to their former service.
In fact, the financial group is obviously seeking to recover the costs of renewals and seeks a buyer for his two immobile, such as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland", quoting a password.
This password did not indicate the reasons for the proposed sale.
He said, "We're checking if it's more interesting to take care of the immobile or sell them, and to restore them to the location later."
Thus, the largest financial institution of Germany has already cedged its seat, shortly after.
Only in the middle of 2007, the bank had purchased joint tours for a sum of EUR 272 million with own fund holders.
Transformations for energy optimisation included approximately 200 million euros, according to certain indications.
A sale would obviously report a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the journal, experts in this activity sector consider the value of tours, rebaptized between "Green Tours", about 500 million euros.
According to the portfolio, we do not know now whether the immobile will be sold again to a fund belonging to the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people are weeping the small ones who have lost.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a view of the smaller sepulchriers who were declared dead after several explosions occurred in a mine.
We were still not able to overcome the body because the safety situation of the sinister puzzle continues to be precovered.
Just two weeks a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors whose age was between 17 and 62 years had been buried under the ground.
A survey has been introduced into the sinised puzzle, but no trace of surroundings was discovered.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gas and other explosions that followed, no sugar team could be able to descend into the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration thought that the minors had no chance to survive.
Until the bodies can't be able to be raised up.
Today, parents and friends have organized a feast for the memory of the dead.
Thousands of people were gathered under a sun in Greymouth in the south of the New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of 29 sepulchries, 29 tables were installed on which names, cakes and lamps could be seen.
Personal photos and effects, including clothes and surf tables, also had their place.
The flags were set in front of all the public buildings of the country.
The New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said to the participants at the Memorial Festival that New Zealand had feeded the hope that the minors would return to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the branches said that he could not resign himself to accept his son's death until he had seen his rest.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' parents, several foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial Festival.
Minors of southern African and British origin have also been buried during the first explosion of 19 November.
The securists began to extinguish a burning within the coal mine of the Southern New Zealand Island.
The Gary Knowles police prefect explained to journalists that when the explosive gas mass is moved, burning temperatures within the mine begin to decrease.
Go to hell, war!
Is the Splatter movie a artificial movie?
The Nicolas Winding Refn performer explodes the limits of the older type through his film, "Wallhalla Rising", the populated fighter.
What public did the Danish Nicolas Winding Refn think well by turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A warrior Viking (Mads Mikkelsen) had only an eye made prisoner; he frees himself from his board and, with a nearly supernatural force, removes his opposers after each other. This is ideal for young men's spectators to search for a bloody action, just because our hero uses brutal attitude methods. When he is bad, he throws away the instincts of his enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the movie, the bourney doesn't say any word on his true name. Even the other persons are allowed to escape around one or two phrases a few terrible agonia cries.
Otherwise, there is nothing to say and a festival in the incroy mountain landing in Scotland, which constitutes the cover of the Vikings Universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be more ideal for kineasts with interest in existentialism and excellent travelling.
When a movie views several target groups, it is damage that these are mutually excluded.
The Winding Refn realizer has been considered since the "Pusher" statement, his trilogy relating to the carrying of pharmaceutical and full of drugs, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but it is to bring a little more humor to the dominant corant or to introduce a little less brutality in the art and test film.
Most of the sympathisants of the art cinema must test the horrible face of the brain that spread around and to the intestins.
Amateurs of action films are dead in anxiety when the boat is shiping, for reasons that we can freely interpret, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship at Jerusalem's destination; they are weakened during a calm and brum before the team arrives in America and continues to kiss.
It is not so surprising that "Walhalla Rising" found no film distributor in Germany and that it is only in the DVD format.
It is especially because of the wonderful images of the mistress that deserved a certain attention, but also because the image of a palpitant movie, from time to time, is hidden behind a pretensive and bloody appearance.
It's not dialogues in this movie, or coherent action, everything is ambition, a fever dream transformed into a movie.
The spectator can't escape there.
Reph gives him almost a moment of delight and slowly cut him off with iceal images and a bullshit sound band, but especially with an inseatable hate that goes out of the heart of the persons.
Only a young blonde boy, who remains faithfully at the side of the breast, keeps a certain innocentness, all others are animated by anger.
More than all, the hero borns whose mobiles are never too, but who comes back from the hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by transforming themselves into wars, maybe he is sent by the Devil himself.
It represents the pausement, but maybe also, nothing but for those who are, in any way, cut off.
"Walhalla Rising" is a enginematic movie that can be hated or addicted, which finally has appeal, enthusiasm and amazing.
A traumatising experience.
Mystery terrace travels
The International Atom Energy Agency (AIEA) has new indications on a nuclear programme developed by the AEA.
However, this country will take position on this subject, even less than undertaken by the Agency's controls.
In the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 to midnight, at least four flight aircraft F-15 I attacked a mysterious building of forms on the Syrian territory.
It is on the edge of the Euphrates; the largest town nearby is 30 km: it is Dair as-Sur.
His name is found in the AIEA documents, because it is a question of the reaction that the reacter built it appears with the help of North Korea in stone parallels, dissimulated in a valley marked by the non-electric corant.
According to a lettering of the United States information services, the current reacter, known as the neighbourhood site, El Kibar, would be able to produce pluto, which would enable the manufacture of atomic weapons.
However, this technology is valid since the 1950s.
A video showed a presentation containing fluid satellite images.
By means of the animation assisted by a person, it indicated the emplacement of each component of the reaction before the destruction of the central that represents a miniature copie of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear central.
Furthermore, she presented the photos showing the building nearby, even inside it.
It is that the reacter was on the point to be served, but he was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after Israel’s bombing, the mystery has a lot more information than at the time, even with time, the mystery is more and more.
The former president of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that before this attack, it was sure that the reaction was built in el Kibar, but it was not a little bit available to show that the country was developing "a active nuclear army program".
Some information agents in Europe prefer to be more implied in this regard and only speak of a "reactor presumptuous", even if they consider the presentation of the "plausable".
They miss tangible evidence, as well as the AIEA.
Answered about how it was assured that he had a nuclear reacter, a United Nations high-range diplomate gave only a laconic response by claiming that the AIEA had "adequate documents to ask questions".
The Syrians have certainly removed precipiently the "unused military building" coverages and processed a methodic planning of the land.
However, in June 2008, a team of AIEA experts conducted by the ancient inspector of Oli Heinonen, covered the el Kibar of Ur traces from men.
Furthermore, the AIEA has received a Member State of the satellite images of trade providers showing the time that directly followed the attack.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous commander, perhaps Israel, has purchased them.
This is impossible for the AIEA to set their authenticity objectively.
It always assured that she had never implemented a secret atomic programme and that she had not built a reaction.
It supports that the time found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
However, the AIEA recalled this argument after the analysis of particulates by qualifying it as inversible.
Since that time, the lady has discussed all about this, as well as about satellite images.
Furthermore, the controllers are not allowed to perform a second inspection on the site of El Kibar and access to the building coverages destroyed by the bomb.
Yet, even Israel keeps an obstinated silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in exercise at the time of the attack, recently said, "We will never make comments on this issue."
This is so that the question on this matter has been long-term since June 2008 without reaching a result and that "the Agency is more increasingly transformed into a serious problem of the credibility," as it recognises a western high-range diplomate at the AIEA headquarters in Vienna, finally it is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Arms.
The AIEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of three other installations which must have "a functional report" with the reacting assumption.
Until now, the inspectors have not indicated what installations it is here or what their function is or what they are supposed to contain.
According to the information provided by the magazine "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known inside the AIEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as well as the name of neighborhood cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security Institute (International Scientific and International Security Institute) of Washington identified these localities and covered a complex net to Masyaf on satellite images, which would probably be one of the suspicioned objects.
It is possible to be located in a military basis or directly next to it; this is exactly why the three sites are accessible to the AIEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the inspection group is actually a spion that would be sent on behalf of the United States by the AIEA to spy military installations.
In fact, it is an information provided by the American secret agents that attached the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The AIEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made ships between the three sites and the rock parallel to transport substances.
A west-range diplomate said to Vienna that at least one of the installations could "serve for the production of fuel".
It would not have "no sensitive activities" such as the enrichment and recovery of ura; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reaction certainly works through the non-enriched uri.
However, there is a degree of claimable hypotheses regarding the following questions: where the ura should have come from and where the pluto has been separated later for the production of the bomb.
It is ignored whether the records, which could hide high value tracks, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of land loaded trucks are disappeared, no one will have information on the storage site of the records.
For the AIEA, it is not worth that in 1998 the AIEA has examined the al-Tibni salt mine, which is only a few kilometers from el Kibar, on the other hand of Euphrates, to see if it can agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
By analyzing recently photos taken by satellite for the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former AIEA inspector, Mr. Robert Kelley set a link between these and the responsor.
However, photos taken by satellite show that the AIEA has entered terrace travels in the three suspicious sites and moved large containers when the AIEA began to require access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it has not contributed to dismissing suspicions.
In the diplomatic environments, the AIEA has spent several months to prepare a plan on inspections to be carried out, which should have been allowed to maintain possible military secrets. Only the time of investment shows how much interest the inspectors are in this case.
Punctuation this time, also concluded this proposal.
For a year ago, if the OHD diplomats in Vienna had not stated the destruction of the reacter, the emergency would not be reported for this matter, for example, Glyn Davies, the US Ambassador who has stated that the special inspections are known for a few months, one of the most powerful means that the Atom Agency has to implement its controls.
The director of the AIEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "a option to which I am open in the future", but it is still hesitated.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, there is a majority of the AIEA Governors Council and a large number of 35 countries that are represented there are no desire to see the situation of a scale.
on the other hand, like this diplomate that gives to reflect: "Will it serve, if they finally find nothing?"
Love in Wartime
It's wrong since Angelina Jolie has started as a realistic.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a story of love between a woman originating in Bosnia and a Serbian man.
We don't know anything about this story anymore, but it's enough to cause disease.
A continuous sound indicates that the woman, a Muslim, has fallen in love with her Serbian bourreal during the war of Yugoslavia.
The Federations of Bosnia women immediately protested. In response, some tourning sequences planned in Sarajevo have been moved to Hungary in the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is turned to Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to the information provided in a Bosnia Journal, Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of victims of war women addressed an correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Reformed (HCR) and requested to meet the actor.
She is not diplomatic, but a few weeks ago she proposed to those women to meet them in Hungary, but these dismissed this offer.
"The meeting must be in Bosnia," Hasecic states.
There were no stories of love in concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario said it very long about his attitude towards victims.
The Guarantee reports that the organization of Hasecic later recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner to return the quality of good will ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnia Cultural Ministry, who received copies from his scenario, gave after some exhibitions a tournament authorisation to Sarajevo, but we do not know why it was not then coming despite this authorisation.
The young author assures herself that she does not continue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she has made for the Jugoslavia conflict, which supports that she wants to enhance the terrible consequences of war and to give the opportunity to all interested parties to express himself.
However, it remains vague about the contents.
This is a second synopsis of the film on the Net. It is quite different: Lovemen knew well before the beginning of the war. It comes to meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported into the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
What is likewise a great difference with the version "a victim of violence loves his board".
That Jolie's movie started well before war, of course.
The pressure that is exercising on it, thus expressed by Jolie, is "injust and based on wrong information".
Now only Hollywood's fanatics can seek peace: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, as many others before.
Let's go!
This evening, everything's going well with the Irish.
no consternation trace.
That is why the local team dominates the visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans swimming with joy in the bottom of a strong music, they throwing their feet.

Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtil game to drink and the booked information, these two behaviors are really not good in .
Yet, however, the 26-year-old young man is trying to enjoy, to turn away from the tender question, which will take place on the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not in its projects, and in January, it will lead to embauch entrepreneurs in New Zealand.
"I'm still trying a strange feeling," he says.
"The country is so far and I don't have any employment."
Finally: His girlfriend already attacked Auckland, "before two, she dismissed her desired job as a successful project loaded, perhaps a good sign," said the young man, laughing.
due to dark perspectives in the country, two of the three sisters of Tanner tried their chance in the foreign.
His sister Yvonne, a social assistant, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin now takes a computer consultant post in London.
Young people are going: The situation of most families on the island reacts to the tanners.
Experts of the Economic and Social Research Institute indicate that 100,000 Irish people will nearly leave their country.
They even provide a number of 200,000 emigrants from 2015.
What represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million residents.
If these provisions are fulfilled, it will be a migration currency comparable to that Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irelands have played a big appeal, the harm now takes place.
The economic crisis, however, is particularly affected by the young Irish, well-formed, who have not yet known just a time of happiness.
The loss of employment and social deficiency appeared absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's overcast money.
But in time, three people in ten less than thirty years are in unemployment.
The Irish Times magazine reveals the letters of readers published by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes to the destruction."
"There should be an elevation against politicians and the bans, but whoever has the opportunities of this is going out and our country is so a whole generation."
"The last to leave out of the light."
Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish students' syndicate, points to a darkerer future because the government only makes the pump to the eyes and offers no perspective of future to young people.
"They reduce the minimum payments, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her friends cramp from a practical stage that is not paid to another.
She says that her biggest concerns are to migrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressive thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to cope with this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" room that provides full support on the "work in the foreign".
"But the work in the foreign is a exceptional opportunity for new people in the profession to make the first steps at the levels of professional hierarchy," said the responsibility.
His website shows photos of snow surfs and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is: Working in the foreign is not a gallery, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
Six months ago, Sean O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Ireland's construction sector.
A mode house just comes from the ground to Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hanovre or Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan is rarely visiting his country because he participates in an additional job in order to purchase the contracted credit to build his house in the country.
"The situation is already a little deep," he claims by sharing the floor of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I won money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I don't live anymore."
He scatters a loud laughing through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-good gardens, precious cars of large marks are stationed on the roads of access.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with her sister for a amount of EUR 380,000, 100 percent financed by the credit.
"There were times of foolishness, no doubt the money was easy," he said.
Has he feared to see everything rolling on account of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, resurrects the warm tea and says, "I don't have kids to enter and I'm young; even though everything goes through, I can distribute to zero."
The building engineer does not like the complaints he often hears in recent times.
"Nobody must suffer from hunger, our situation is not even as dramatic as what we have ever seen here in the island," he supports.
"Thatting for a moment in the foreigner is not what might happen worse, perhaps that makes us feel about Irish.
He rided and then talked about his father who went into the territory during the last large economic crisis.
"He was back after he had spent seven years and, in Ireland, life was just going on."
This idea likes Cian Tanner.
Make the future and find out how life goes elsewhere.
In his palmary, he has already counted a few years of work in London. That is why life must not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is another thing that concerns him well in the last days: the festival to organize at the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid that she can't turn herself into a wedding evening.
"Only, not many emotions," he said by drinking a long beer gorgeo.
"A goodbye, that seems to be the same anxious."
"Let's rather call this a night to see, all detained, gathering a few friends, with some drinks and some games."
Democratic Rutine
The support for the democracy in Latin America continues to be, as the private company.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influent than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last latinobarometer survey taken in 18 countries and encouraged by The Economyst.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it follows the changes in the attitude in the region.
Two related elements are the results of the survey of this year, carried out in September and early October.
The first is the quite sunset in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of the attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
The support to democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the surrounding of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached in average 6% per year since 2002, the democracy support has passed from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy re-resurrected after a high decrease in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two largest countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduce the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of the responsibles of the region have been satisfied with the way the democracy of their countries worked in practice; this is the same number as last year but with a strong increase in 25% in 2001 (graph 3).
Some 34% said that they had confidence in the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in the two cases, but increased strongly in 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic issues in Latin America have deployed the support for democracy.
If this has been good during the world financial crisis, it is probably due to the fact that many of America's countries have only occurred a short recess and have benefited from a strong renewal.
In addition, a social security network has contributed to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased in 2009 and re-decreased this year to 32%.)
But the humor varies from one country to another (see graph 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of his outcoming president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are translated by a broadly shared progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and where violent crimes were severe.
It is only for the second time that the investigation has started more responsibilities throughout Latin America in its inhabitants than unemployment as the most important problem for their countries (see Table 5).
Approximately 31% say that themselves or one of their neighbors have been victims of an act in the past year; however, this number is decreased by 38% in the last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A stronger economic performance reflects the increase in support to the private undertaking and market economy: approximately 71% of the responsibles in the region say that the private undertaking is essential for development, against 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their countries developed, against 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the Venezuelan respondents are of this opinion (and 80% support the private undertaking); even though their Left President Hugo Chavez is exhausted by many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of the questioned persons (contrast 18% in the last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged in comparison to the last year) and Venezuela (9% in decreasing by 11% since the last year)
However, the United States are considered the most affected country by responding to Mexico and in the largest part of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A wounded vote
Nobody had perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was far worse than the foreigners who wanted to help the land in fear.
Review boxes and new vote boxes were presented, spread voting bulletins in the rubbers, broken voting offices and intimidations
The voting offices would open late night.
Many Haitians, including many who have been moved after the January session, would be in the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them ended by abandoning.
A twelve candidate to the presidential, whose many favours were assumed, expressed fraud and claimed to cancel the election.
Protections, sometimes violent, have exploded through the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the high officer in Haiti of the United Nations, views the event as "a very good choice in many aspects".
Some observers of the United States and the Caribbean Community said that they did not believe that these irregularities, even seriously, had necessarily invalided the process.
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposers are able to return to René Preval, the immature president, and its candidate Jude Célestin, shall announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second expected tour is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two candidates of the opposition, Michael Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirland Manigat, a former lady, returned from their initial call for the vote to be declared no.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has a little or no support in the electors, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tour, reached the second tour.
With a cholera epidemic that makes rage, and more than 1 million surroundings in the seism that still live in tents, feared that the participation would be.
In fact, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing it because of the disorganization.
Approximately 250 000 identity cards needed to vote were not distributed a little while before the election.
The game is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and popular government as an important step in the rebuilding of Haiti.
And thus, it is, the Haitians themselves do it.
The point of the feet to the center
The weeks after being suddenly widowed, Argentina's president Cristina Fernández benefited from a public sympathic vague that improved its 20-point approval rate, more than 50%; it was its highest level since it was chosen in 2007.
However, transforming this into a successful campaign for a second mandate during a election in the next year could depend on the choice of Mrs Fernández, which she would leave or not the intransition of her dead husband, pre-decessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, about that, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to handle the economic policy, even after his wife succeeded to him as a president, had the habit of developing budgets that underestimated tax income, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to expenditure additional income to volunteer.
The Government of Mrs Fernández lost its majority in the Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation was devastated after Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart crisis on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the perronist movement to the power took place at Mrs. Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (which a parliamentary struck one of his pars and others accused the Government of corruption), the Congrès must not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to disappear," said the President.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be applied in the next year, allowing the Chairman a more larger manner for voluntary expenditure.
Economy broadly survives: it is possible to increase nearly 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is now at 11.1% but many private estimates and the salarial refunds of syndicates are about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took his functions in 2003 when Argentine was afraid of economic distortion, made a priority for growth and poverty reduction, rather than for inflation control.
He was dealing with FMI, enhanced the private sector and cleaned the INDEC, the statistical office, which had processed statistics on official inflation.
Can Mrs Fernández now modify these policies?
She called for speakers between private enterprises and syndicate leaders.
And his officers say that they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
Economy has been stimulated by high world prices for agricultural exports from Argentina.
However, inflation has evacuated the growth of powder due to a strong assessment in 2002.
It may be why Mrs Fernández shows signs of desire to restore the financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with the obligationary who had committed an earlier reevaluation of the debt for which Argentina had not implemented its debt in 2001.
Now Mrs. Fernández seems to be adding to an agreement with creditors governments grouped in the Paris Club, for which it is worth some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted on the fact that this could not involve a monitoring by the FMI, as it is usual.
But in the last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister for Economics, announced that the Fund would provide a "technical assistance" to create a new national price index for consumption, which results in a prejudice to the sanction of the INDEC.
It is not worth if Mrs Fernández wants to stay in the policy beyond the end of its mandate, now that her husband is no longer at her side.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the average class, among which the chirchnerism is very designed.
When the Argentinas are returned from their summer holidays in March, the sympathic vague for her will have fled.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide to reject or not, without a voice, many policies of her husband.
A half-hour for China
The Taiwan electors focused on a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother on the other side of the detroit?
More than 7.5 million electors were presented on 27 November, or 70% of the approved persons, to elect officers and advisers in five cities, in the context of what is considered as a general evaluation of the President, My Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings related to the continent, which has made innovative business links, including a partial free exchange pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. My test has succeeded, but it's right.
Although its Kuomintang party (KMT) received three of the five majors, he failed to receive the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressist Party (DPP), who was aware of the full independence of Taiwan, received nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT by 45%.
If this had been a presidential vote, Mr. Ma would be in difficulty.
Since it was chosen two years ago, the part of its vote has fallen about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attached electors, even with the KMT in the municipal advice.
The event has revealed most of the main subjects of Taiwan elections, including tissue campaign trucks and mass race flags with girls who danced in minimum.
A mysterious mystery attempt has also been perpetrated.
Sean Lien Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, has made an electoral tour for a KMT candidate at the box of the election.
A man of the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, hurting him and killing a man.
Wonderfully, it has not been determined whether the tractor wants to hurt Mr. Lien or to make a difference with the candidate.
Thus, said Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had effects on the election by leading suspicion on the DPP and turning the electors to the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of elections was China.
It was appealing to find out how exciting the question of the continental part itself was.
Instead, candidates played plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually plays his fact independence and hates China's military threat.
Hence, KMT has tend to avoid stoping its links with the Government of Pekin.
But this time, the DPP also refused to touch the anti-Chinese feeling.
This is the answer to a new conscience that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for its part, granted a confirmation to know whether its China policy was acceptable for the Thaiwan majority.
It can be expected that the Pékin Government continues to provide commercial facilities, to its strategies aimed at taking Taiwan back to bear.
China has not lost time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summary on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would like to see a political integration; but let's start with the beginning.
It is best to wait for this after the presidential election of 2012.
The DPP has been recovered in any way.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison after corruption.
The Chairman of 2000 to 2008 was a prosecutor for an explicit independence.
However, a new generation of moderates has seen the day under the direction of Mrs. Tsai and the PDP is working in order to attach professionals and young people.
Mrs. Tsai was welcomed as a DPP candidate to the Presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing his best to show that he can also engage with Pekin.
Mrs. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between DPP and China, provided that their interviews may take place without preliminary conditions.
Mrs. Tsai ra' to the Taiwan public that her party presents a "dependent trust alternative" in relation to Mr. Ma's precipient approach to China.
Mr. Chen ́ exasperated by this change.
In a statement from its cell, he stated that the PDP candidates would have received better results if they insisted on the fact that Taiwan was a different country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to break the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will be difficult to choose between its potential candidates.
KMT must make a self-introspection.
Mr. Ma's evaluations have been low; despite a gross economic growth, KMT's candidates did not want to campaign with him.
His immobility is largely due to unemployment and the extension of the footnote between rich and poor.
A KMT portfolio says that its cabinet and its local antennes will be replaced.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for the approach is limited.
At the same time, most Thaiwanians see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a editorial eminent, "the point of no return has already passed."
Names for Grammy Awards: Esperanza Spalding jazz song is a chosen surprise in the category "best new artist"
Following on the request of a President, people are obliged to know it.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year-old jazz and song bassist by President Obama to take place during his ceremonie of the Nobel Price of the Pace in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a large name in the category of the "best new artist".
As Spalding is a very known figure on the jazz scene since 2008, "Hope", the nomination remains a little mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards, which a artist must not extract more than three albums before the recording; which "determines the identity of this artist".
His ambitional album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society", has probably marked a step forward and, due to his vocal impliantly, his powerful hand of pop and ↓ and its Latin influences, it is possible for at least one line pointed to Spalding as regards the successful success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent for the Grammy Awards electors, taking into account jazz productions in this category in the last years.
In addition, the electors of Grammy Awards have just honored "History" of Vijay Iyer Trio in the "instrumental album" category, a wheel on a refrigerator of a record that was one of the primary favors last year.
Among these Yesterday, "Moody 4B" of the veteran saxophonic James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Thrombone Shorty, favored by the sound voice of the New Orleans and invited to the "Treme" of HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which is strongly attached to a certain combination with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of Savage Darcy James Argue, known to the steampunk, has won some well-deserved skills in the large category en. Competition with Billy Childs' rich chamber-jazz and everlasting adventure Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his live bytes was a good example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group head.
Nomination of Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey are running into classic categories
Classical nominations for the 53th Grammy Awards annually conduct a mixture of musician lands and compositors worldwide.
In the head of the nominations, we cite "God Ex Machina" of Michael Daugherty, for the piano and the orchestra, with five "yes" and "Dreamhouse" of Steve Mackey, a electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among those named with link to South California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphonie No 4, "Los Angeles", a work commanded by the Philharmonic Orchester of Los Angeles and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the compositor based on Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in school for a resource.
The classic nominations are distributed on 13 categories covering records of orchestra, opera, choral and soil.
A category for the classic producer of the year contains five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are the Symphonies no.3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchester of the Concertgebouw; "God Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacreficium is the art of the Castrati" and the "Requiem" of the Verdi of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
The named "Lulu" of the Orchester of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" of Kaija Saariaho of the German Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchester and the Chœur of the Theâtre Mariinsky; and "Ivanhoe" of Arthur Suōvan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The compositors who are located for the Grammy Awards for the contemporary composition account Pärt for the Symphonie No 4, Daugherty for "God Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatively More", Mag日 Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
The Symphonie No.4 of Pärt had its first in Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution registered by the Philharmonic Orchester of Los Angeles, managed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of approximately 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oilmagnat of Mikhail Khodorkovski, prisoned in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman was appointed for his solist instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said that he had written the work of 15 minutes especially for the mandoline Avi Avital, who played the concert with the Metropolis En日, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it by using sounds from the Middle East and a lot of northern African gammes and rites," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old orchestra chief Peter Boulez received a nomination in the category of orchestra performances, for conducting the Chicago Symphonic Orchester in a record of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental solists who received a nomination, we cite Nelson Frire and Marc-André Hamelin's planists; Paul Jacobs, Julia Fischer's violonist and Sarah Schuster Ericsson's harpist.
This year, there are only nominated vocalists-solists; these are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixture category, Jesse Norman's superno got a nomination for his recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula Moschee drafts the approval of the Planning Committee.
A draft mosque in Temecula received anonymous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public witnessing, often paused.
The criticisms took place in the draft state that it promoted both terrorism and trade embarrassment.
But the Commissioners statued Thursday evening that the new religious center respected local laws and that it would be extremely impressive.
"Multium people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, taking the word Thursday morning.
"I am proud of it as a American citizen."
"This shows that justice does it."
"The opposition is really minimal," he said.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting started at 18 hours and took up until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the center, at nearly divided speech time, the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," wrote an interventor.
"It's another planet of sands with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned islamic centres also raised protests in other parts of the country, including in the Ground Zero, in place of attacks of 11 September 2001 in New York City.
Having Mahmoud Harmoush has stated violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her 135 families of the order are co-incidentless in the Riverside count for years, but she wanted a larger and better space than the storage she praised on a property shared with a manufacturer of water filtering systems.
The new mosque of 24,943 feet in the architecture of Mediterranean would be composed of two mines and would be 43 feet high.
It would take a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of the Chaparral School.
The opposers may still call against this project to the municipal Council.
An arisnic tolerant microbe highlights the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange territory, which can use arsennic as one of its nutrient elements, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and maybe out there.
Although researchers have covered the Territory here on Earth, they say that it shows that life has opportunities beyond major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphor, or with arisnic."
"This is why she is very special, even if she is far away from being a really "foreign form of life", commented Paul Davies C. W. from the University of State of Arına, the co-operator of the report in the Science's online edition.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, azote, oxygen, phosphor and suffrage.
However, researchers discovered that the territory, covered in the Mono Lake in California, is able to continue to develop after replaced phosphore by arsenic.
"We ask ourselves what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. at the State University of Arına, co-operator of the report.
The discovery is important in the area of life research beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life does not have, says Anbar.
The study is on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss this, which did not disclose the details of the troop, generated speculations spread on the Internet, which the report could disclose the covering of an outermost life.
That wasn't the case.
The covering "shows that, in other planet environments, the organisms could be able to use other elements to act biochemically and that the "standard" of the elements, which we absolutely consider necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor of the Planetary and Space Research Institute, Open®, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in biochemical and biochemical structure," Cockell said.
It wasn't a fortified discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrology Institute, who conducted the study, chose the Mono Lake because it is given high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphor are chemically similar; so it spyed that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace one another.
"Arsenic is primarily toxic because its chemical behaviour is really similar to the phosphor."
"Consequently, the bodies are difficult to distinguish these items separately."
"But arisnic is quite different to not work exactly like the phosphor; it walks inside and, in some way, goes the work of our biochemical machine," explained Anbar.
Researchers collected the characteristics known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to growing arsenic concentrations that it could adjust and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphor, but the fact that it can live with arisnic at the place highlights the possibility that a life form using arisnic can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where the arisnic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea, which arisnic could be replaced by phosphor, was not new; but nothing showed that it could work.
The arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth; so the researchers issued the hypothesis that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there might be other ways to form life, not only the way life on Earth was created at the beginning," said Foster, which was not part of Wolfe-Simon search team.
Research was financed by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Institute.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The two other dogs of exhibition on four furnishes from the outside of a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of Los Angeles County announced it Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two acits and two corgis pembroke gallois - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had passed the night outside a motel 6 of Bellflower, announced the authorities.
Two dogs were recovered after midnight and the other two were found at the end of Thursday evening, said to Steve Whitmore, the portfolio of the sheriff's office of Los Angeles County.
"Good news is that dogs go good," Whitmore said.
"They're in good forms."
"They have been returned to their owners."
Whitmore said exactly where the dogs had been found, in which quarter and the circumstances of their covering.
"A survey is running."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a Thursday comment.
They were gathered on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a refresh for animals in Downey.
Sheriff adjoints found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month woman, was healthy and free, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgies that Rickard and Peek had planned to show regional concurrences this week, for the owners of the Japanese dogs, were lost until their covering Thursday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend in the context of the "AKC/Eukanuba" national campionat of Long Beach, where they were presenting Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other tests scheduled in the days of the exposure "AKC/Eukanuba", said Peek at the Times Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They are often staying in the motels and driving their truck outside, just next to the window of their room.
They brought three other dogs - a chiot Boxer, a ter; Parson; and a British Spanish - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, to the whistle, in the truck where it would be more costly.
They have a little open windows so that dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck flight at 6 hours Tuesday.
Peek said that they would offer a resource to any person who could lead them to corgis, with an implanted micropuzzle to identify them.
It is not if a ree has been granted Thursday.
The lion is ready to red again, MGM's revolt is more than the final green fire of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green fire to start again at zero.
A federal judge of the deficits in New York, officially praised the "pre-packed" plan by the creditors, which would be eliminated about 5 billion dollars of debt; opening the road to the enterprise of enterprise with 86 years of existence, to ensure its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television emissions.
With the Sunday decision, which is satisfied with the requirements of the United States failure code, no legal obstacle remains in front of MGM to fleet under the protection of the Entertainment Spyglas Fundators, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become general directors of what will be an aleged study.
The staff will be returned at approximately 320 of 400.
MGM will not actually evacuate Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility, intended to finance the new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under licence by the investment bank, which is $75 million, and should be financed until mid December.
The study renovation process started in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. Investment Bank was engaged to advise the direction on how to put its funds because it had no means to pay interests up to $300 million per year.
In the month of ao, the Director-General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an old Enron PDG and a re-resurrected expert for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and to satisfy more than 140 students took much more time than planned.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to sold the company.
However, the sale to the undertakings has reached a few subsequents among whom no of them was ready to pay the amount of 2 billion more of the creditors.
In the early years, it was necessary to repeat when the MGM team had started working on a plan of repealing which, after months of internal dealing and debates, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM is officially out of deficit in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive premies of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, who collected $375 000 per month for their business management services, will receive a "success premium" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are going to restore the production of MGM, which only one movie came out this year, and put on an annual list of seven or eight movies that would be out of 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The study must conclude a different loan between $265 000 and $275 million to finance its part in these two movies, which Peter Jackson has to be carried out.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds approximately 18% of MGM debt, has tried to make a combination of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not have an agreement.
Games Tech to maintain your balanced gift budget
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful game of this year is the IPAD, followed, maybe, by Microsoft, Kinect video game system, both can make an important breach in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of a iPad, you can buy five BMX cars at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 corners to run classic perles, or approximately 48 play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your budget balanced.
Recently, I visited three national players - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic games I could buy for less than $80.
It is that the Law de Moore has developed, the game of this year is possible to have more power; even though it costs the same price a little less, compared to the last year.
Moreover, while there are generally less new games associated with web sites, two of the most with this type, Webkinz and Penguin Club, have more offers.
And button pile games are increasing, as well as reloadable pile games.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars for 3 years and more) are players in the size of an Indian kitchen that sing a note when you press them on the boat.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows to compose a song.
If you buy more, they will sing in accordance.
Warning: When you start pressing, you can't stop anymore.
To combinate the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspiring from Elmo Live last year, the 14-powder animation powder plays role games like Simon Says and can do moon dance through its innovative older foot with wheels blocking.
Children who have spent the game use Mickey as dance teacher while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Al ́e, one of the first educational games that are informed.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a back-fill shot filled with questionnaire cards designed to transform a car ball into a session with a self-correction and a vacuum class.
If you are disappointed when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo (60 dollars, for the 3 to 8 years) is the lowest and easier to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate effectively as the Explorer Leapster (70 dollars for the 3 to 12 years), it is the first large review of the Leapster Game, with a newer and more comfortable game.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL (90 dollars, for the 3 to 7 years) uses a iTunes type system to offer games and electronic books and is provided for a SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for the 8 and more years) is an enemy of five blocks almost larger than an aluminum box, each holds its own LED LED.
The goal is to form words by putting online blocks before the time goes out, it is ideal for an improving spelling concurrence.
Moreover, players have a kind of online connection.
Only based on their presence in the game stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Penguin Club.
To buy your child a online company animal from the Penguin Club, for example, you can hold a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for the 6 to 12 years) which includes a marked room of a hidden code.
When you get the online code, your child receives enough credits to the Penguin magazine for two items at the choice.
It can be acting on rockets or a company animal playing Puffle.
Slowly bigger than the bottom of your teeth bottle, Hexbug Nano ($ 10, for 5 years and more) is the last micro-robots on button.
The bird faus is quickly moved on 12 vibrating silicons in random directions.
It's fun to make a block labyrinth to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Our opposed a fall of the kitchen table and even a momentan passage in our dog's goal.
Bring a more sweet side to maintain the order in China
Tang Shenbin arpensed a city place as a city sergeant at the training by severe inspection of his nervous burdens, by giving low voice orders with a military authority.
He wanted the members of the Chengguan female members - responsible for the public order in China, fearing and disappointed for their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence - to send a certain impression to an enemy of spectators.
"You're right!"
"S percent!"
Show them, he said, "What do the beautiful girls do!"
Four girls who had almost passed the teenage in white bottles, clothes and similar color bottles were guarded.
Four pairs of black shoes to the hall, aligned with the rule.
Four hairs were perfectly cut off because of the top of hair attached by a blue and white knife.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with demand.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government tried to refresh the image of town inspectors in China.
One city requested that all new recrues had a higher study diploma.
The province of Guangdong has changed the green-verte uniforms against a self-discantly more engaged blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced them by a strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an incontrolable snack car by launching black looks, closely for a half hours, until the carrier repacks his business and part.
Xindu, a city district of 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to make a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the middle of 13 women, especially chosen for their appearance, their garb and their young age.
The idea is to give the police a more sweet, more female side to the police.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties to draw the look at this underground city brigade in China
And for the reason, the critics will say.
In contrast to the police, these agents are authorised only to comply with municipal orders by imposing amendments or other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media depend on the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the Hubei province inspectors killed a observer after he used his phone to film them in spreading a protest against a waste decharge.
Last year, a Training Handbook for Pekin inspectors, broken and online, describes how to effectively win criminals without blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pastech colportor was abandoned with a brain lesion after a bathroom with five officers.
An unpredicted video game of violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors formed in the suit of streets sellers.
"Chengguan marked the government," last year China Daily, a national publisher, after a second polymy on taktics.
The magazine claimed a "complete cleaning".
The skeptics say that the neighborhood is far away.
After the district had passed an announcement in October to find eight new female recrues, a editor in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or if they were only a tourist entertainment.
The answer is to be a little of the two.
The department's announcement requested female candidates from 18 to 22 years of age to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five roads of the face in the right order".
They must have a higher size than the average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 pounds.
The retirement of 26 years is mandatory.
The officers said that the work was too painful for women over 25 years.
"This is their image that is important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a nearly-governmental website.
First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they agree; it is size, weight, face traits, etc.
Then the temperature and the "internal qualities".
The women of Chengguan are like flower vessels, he said, "Instead of being vessels, they will have other responsibility.
Zheng Lihua, assistant director of the town district management office, does not adhere to this description.
However, he noted that the height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sex.
This is the case of the requirement related to the order of face traits.
That this means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, handicaped or deformed persons must not postulate.
"We can't let a person drinking or a boss come to serve here," Mr. Zheng said.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrociated on the Baoguang place near a monastery, is 22 years old and has games packed with a finely incurred mouth.
She doesn't consider the valuation of her appearance as a sexist, said she.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for an unused air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old age, said, "Our work is to present the city's image."
They did not oppose the limitation of their mandate, because they feed greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers in the streets where they were to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a twelve walking goods that move quickly to the foot or to the wheel, trying to sell as far as possible small bread or tofu bottles before taking away.
"Master Wang, you have to go."
"We have already told you several times!" said Ms. Xu while a seller was running away, temporarily abandoning his cartridge to knives.
The agents describe their functions rather than as monotons as ardues.
"It's almost the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20 years old, who studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their man-approvals to confiscat the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to signal the contravenants to their masters.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the propagation of false voices that the Hungarian agents had killed a seller.
On one night, more than twelve police officers and the Chengguan agents were wounded, 14 government vehicles were wounded or burned.
Xindu has gone to such a violence.
But the calm isn't well guaranteed.
Only two pieces of houses of the place of Baoguang, where women's sex officers were guarding this morning, more than 50 people gathered themselves at the road corner.
The agents confiscated a motor that was being repaired on the trottoir rather than in a store, as it imposes their regulations.
The owner of the motor was crying to the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the cops, at the left face, squeaked a cookie road to their vehicle and went all fast with the motor and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a co-ordinator attached to the man team, remained behind, his white bathroom returned to hide his name.
Like women's sex officers, coordinators - men of age 40 or more - are purely playing a support role.
In contrast to them, they are not trained to maintain a circled image.
Sometimes, we are verbally.
"Now sometimes we'll be stuck," Mr. Lee said of a neutre.
"The majority of time, it's the public who starts."
Prosecutors will not commit Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have raised the employment of Senator John Ensign, dealing with a case related to an assistant of an ancient campaign and its efforts to make a lobbying work for the wife's husband, announced on Wednesday the Senator's lawyers.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat confronted by Mr. Ensign, the Republic of Nevada, which was considered as a possible republical candidate to the presidential of 2012 until the scandal around its case did not make the large national titles last year and hurt its career.
Mr. Ensign's office said that he was "very happy" by the decision, resulting from an investigation of a year.
The Senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senatoral Committee of Ethics.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign had no longer been subject to the investigation and that he had no intention to keep any accusation against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice has dismissed a comment on this issue.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise for many external ethical lawyers in the Ministry of Justice, which would have significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on the lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, in October 2009 in New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of its assistants, to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the case of the Senator with her.
Mrs. Hampton has once served as a treasure in a Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funds to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they engaged Mr. Hampton to make lobbying for them;• documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a member of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by the law to make lobbying to his former employer or Senat in his own.
Ethical experts supported the agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, in contrast with the prohibition of the turning door of the lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been rendered, " there is a primary evidence of a complot in order to violate and violate substantively the law of the turning gate," Stanley Brand, a lawyer in Washington, specialised in the defense of customers of an investigation by the Government.
Although the Minister's judge had explained the reasoning led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Ministry seemed to be dismissed of political persecutions after a number of high-level reversed by its section of integrity, including the decisions taken last year to abandon the prosecutions against the former Senator Ted Stevens accused of prosecution.
The Federal Prosecutors feared to take the weapons, said Melanie Sloan, the Director-General for responsibility and ethics in Washington, a defence group who received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically states high-ranging government officers can now maintain the laws not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call on Monday from a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice and a follower next day, saying that the minister was not seeking accusations against his client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers' team had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the Senator, as his office, reaffirmed him on Wednesday in a committed, had acted in law.
Mr Coggins said to express the legal arguments he had made to the park.
"I am not able to enter into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to leave an investigation on an independent complaint by the ethical group, supporting that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Committee stated that it had not enough evidence to prove that money was only a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company who has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton to find lobbying work.
A e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's cabinet head, John Lopez, had met Mr. Hampton and told him that he would "martel" the Ministry of the Interior on a litige issue.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a breakfast with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada's client, Allegiant Air, and asked the transport secretary to fix a meeting on behalf of the Air Company after committing Mr. Hampton to make lobbying.
When the news of the case had surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized his electors and released his leadership to the fourth Republic rang in Senat.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated that he intended to carry out a third mandate in the Senat two weeks ago.
By announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the objective of an investigation, his port-word, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator would hope that the Ethical Committee would quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign rejoices to continue its acharized work in the name of the Nevada people, says she.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
A half twelve of them were taking away in the ranges of the audience room.
They sent every minute horrible witness reports via Twitter.
Finally, the defence said that there were more than 140 000 messages on the violation case and children attached to their bed in a house that was burned.
Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was recognized for the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in the Connecticut, should be sentenced to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty voted by the jury.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already placed elements to the court that have been able to take the courts for years.
What is provoking is that intense reports on the process - as well as the generalized and extended use of Twitter journalists - have created a "cycle atmosphere ", a so extensive and instaurable saturation with inflammable details that the jury has been wrongly affected by the public's ambitions.
The request could motivate the appointment judges to discuss the question of whether new rules require new rules in the audience rooms.
"I have made the experience in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of news in the audience rooms is reached by the person's rights to a proper proceeding," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, lawyer.
The Court of Justice, Jon C. Bleue of the Supreme Court of State, rejected the complaints in the sentence last week, claiming that the media were "softly controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been encouraged by the passion.
But this is not the last word on the matter.
Call courses have since decades that the media covering of notorial cases can lead to questions on the equity of a court.
In a judgment of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States announced the condemnation of a hostopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for his wife's attitude, supporting in its decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphere in the court " due to media.
The crime is considered by some who have been the inspiration of television emission and the "Feiler" movie.
Some lawyers said that the appointment courts invoked to see Mr. Hayes' sentence for a half ago may be curious, given the argument that new rules could be necessary to manage the means of communication of the audience rooms, unimaginable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in the major invergue processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Droit's Olive of Stanford who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report which was arbitraryly applied.
Professor Donohue claims that some appointment judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of the continuous communication from audience rooms could allow justice.
The case of Twitter is only one of many other words described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which may be discussed for years, which delays the execution.
Defence lawyers also claim that Mr. Hayes would have suffered a damage when the judge of Blue allowed them to test the reactions of potential jury by showing them macabra photos of scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jury claimed that the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also contest the constitutionality of death penalty and that they will support that the judge has unjustly expelled one of the jury, which had been critical to the prosecutors, and that he has abused the pressure for a sentence by taking the decision to take the jury to deal in a weekend.
The jury has not been sequestrated.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense median covering of the proceedings could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a contest against the sentence of the last month, that the case was dominated by the median scene in the Connecticut and that it was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates at the Governing Board and at the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media did not stop taking the flames of the case's emotion.
"The daily busculade of the media, cameras and journalists before the palace of justice," wrote the lawyers, "nothing of what has been seen before, in New Haven, and maybe at the national scale."
Their accent on the covering of the Twitter system is controversy.
In the interviews, some journalists said that the statement, which the new instances were more inflammable than the submitted slower, was a pledist view that would complete the Court ' s policy governing the median coverage of the future proceedings.
However, some lawyers said that call courses were often attached to the arguments that social and social changes needed adjustment by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this complaint.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 1966, which had distorted Dr. Sheppard's sentence due to the median covering of the proceedings and claimed that they would call upon the need for new rules for new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represented by Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility draw close to the climate?
After a campaign marked by the inventive and negativity, a minimum of civility was held in Washington this week.
Is this a sign of a real bipartite cooperation to the front or an illusionary moment before the quick return to the partisan fight in the capital?
The March meeting between President Obama and the leaders of the Congrès has not made any survey on the major issues that should be discussed during the session of the "Bootly Canard".
However, there was at least a political discussion on the differences of both parties and the importance of their shared responsibility to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
Thursday meeting of the Committee on the Deficit of the Chairman was also civilized, despite the political differences remaining among the members.
It is that heavy interaction for several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological fosse; but who still shares the members.
It is almost enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a time of testing and mutual testing for signs of cooperation and compliance, while trying to evaluate the limits of opinion and patience of electors for a renewed party war.
Therefore, the meeting of Tuesday and the following comments of the participants have shown a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change in the past two years.
To be tax, expenditure, health care or rights, both parties remain at thousands of distances.
However, the election of November had measured Washington at least in the short term.
"It does not doubt that things have changed on the ton," said Pete Wehner, a Officer of Bush, now next to the Ethical and Public Policy Centre.
"It is inevitable after elections.
Elections arise from partisan ions and then exhaust themselves.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "boots canard" session, the Republicans and the Democrats have no other choice to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
The two parties want to find a way to keep a part or in it permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is intended to extend unemployment allocations, but it would only be because the Republicans cannot be able to make the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while guarding unemployment compensations to workers without employment.
After the Tuesday meeting at the White House, more optimism plans on a possible agreement on issues raised during the "boots" session with the ratification of the "New START" package.
But William Galston, from the Brookings Institute, warns that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily reduce a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th congress is meeting in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is determined or even inevitable.
"When things are to be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the comparisons," he said.
Wehner also expressed its broadly shared skepticism, which would lead to real cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between today and 2012 as a preview or shadow-boxing compared to the 2012 main event, he said.
The reasons are closely linked to the composition of the new majority of the Republic to the Chamber and the electors of the tea that have contributed to its creation.
However, the Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, and they know that they must try to be at the height of their promises to reduce expenses and to abrogate the new health care law.
These partisan positions are now and already held in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Committee, which comprise reform of the tax code and acquiring certain taxes, rejecting the age of retirement and reducing expenditure.
The President Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and themselves have put the issue of deficit on the public calendar in a way that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes to the Committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they were difficult to reach that number.
The greatest resistance is among the elections of the group, which suggests that there are some reasons for tax issues, at least today.
Galston provides two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republic of the Congress.
The first year will come in the form of partisans, since the Republicans are concerned about the budget, tax and health care of Obama, and then followed by a more bilateral cooperation period.
What would be the cause of change?
It's the opinion.
It is largely proved that, despite the partisan mind of the recent election, most Americans always want to see the two parties working in.
If confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, both parties will carefully observe the public's reaction.
He who will be determined to be lost will have to change the head and find compromises.
However, it would be a optimistic point of view.
Partisan spirit and polyarisation are bigger today than they were in the middle of the 1990s and there is a greater ideological division between Obama and the Republics of the Congrès than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the soldiers of the two parties see 2010 as a simple prejudice to a more consequent election in 2012.
As regards this reality, the civilisation exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But there will be much more effort from the two parties to find a hearing area on the issues that still divide them.
United States documents describe Moscow as a hair of corruption
The town's control is in the hands of a "Kleptocratia" and makes a part of the vineyards and the protection money that it collects, reported the United States' ambassade in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service perform large rackets that contribute to explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money, not only from financing companies but also from organized groups.
Each board of office - what Prime Minister Vladimir Poutine called the "vertical power" - takes part when money goes to the top of the scale.
The service note, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was placed on Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources the names have been exposed.
It was edited while Jouri Loujkov was still master of Moscow; and mostly he is responsible for corruption.
The President Dmitri Medvedev was conceived in October, but there have been little cleaning traces since that time.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a first-planed building company, have always denied corruption during the years; and he has won several processes in diffamation on these.
In September, he said the following to a Russian TV chain, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to throw, it's all."
The Russians believe, to a huge majority, that their society is corrupted;
But it is necessary to find the information set out in an ambassador account; and it is unable to conceive that it would be to diplomates of a foreign country to do it.
The direct link between the Government of Moscow and the crime led some people to call it "disfunctional" and to claim that the government worked more as a cleptocratia than a government," the ambassade's note.
"The elements play a " crisha " (term used in the world ↓el/la mafia which literally means " tot " or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Internal (MVD) and the Prosecutor's office, and through the entire Office of the Government of Moscou.
"The analystes to identify a structure at three levels in the Moscow world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the miles are at the second level."
"End, corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which the groups have a empty place in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that FSB breaches the money of the largest companies and that the police targets the small.
A source, he said, "explained that Moscow's company owners realized that it was preferable to protect MVD and FSB (only organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and more power than the groups, but they are also protected by the law."
"This is why the request for protection by the bands is no longer high."
The note indicates that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself may be inequality; even those paying are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closing under a pretext or other.
Medvedev has stated the fight against corruption several times but has admitted a little progress.
The note of the ambassador is transmitted to men who offer values, probably filled with money, until Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrates," said in a recent interview of Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" of Moscou.
"But he is part of this bureaucracy."
"It's not part of a political class because it doesn't exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the costs of corruption would be over 300 billion dollars per year, at the entire scale of Russia.
The country was classified in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental transparency International organization (the countries are classified at least in the most corrupt).
The divulgation of the American ambassador's note, which was done just last night, Moscou's hour, will be sure of the misunderstandings within the Russian Government; although Loujkov could be blamed in a certain way for Moscou's failures, this could be the opportunity for Kremlin to show that it is going to solve the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Poutine issued the hypothesis that WikiLeaks' documents could be a manufacture and reacted angryly to the statements that the United States diplomates had divulgated by calling Batman and reproaching Medvedev of Robin.
"The problem is based on the fact that this is our interaction, the important factor of the internal policy in this country, says he.
"But to be honest with you, we did not assume that it would be done with such a arrogance, such a pressure and, you know, in contrast to ethics."
The elderly fighters of the Red Khmers obligated to face the past
In a badly lighting class room with walls in beton decrepted with bad quality, the director of the secondary oil of Anlong Veng called the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"All of us here loves Your Mok."
"He was a good leader, and he was concerned about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the bucking" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of old Khmers red in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals, ponts and other infrastructures; and where thousands of ancient soldiers of the organization live still today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers returned to the Government, long-term loyalty was finally released in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the Government distributed a high school manual that for the first time teaches the history of the Red Khmers to the children of his former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, together with the United Nations, made its first sentence on an ancient member of the Red Khmers, condemning, to 35 years of prison, the former leader of the famous trial center of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known under the name of "Duch".
Before this development of the situation, anxiety increased with the elderly fighters of the Red Khmers of Anlong Veng; compliance with the efforts of reconciliation and their will to reintegrate in the Cambodia.
"There are feelings and fears among the older Red Khmers but they are impugnant to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, a independent body who is conducting research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmers was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within the families."
Under the Government of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people have been exhausted or died of hunger, sickness or surgeon.
When the Vietnamites invaded and reversed the United Pool Government in 1979, the rest of the regime and his army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that took place until the last of the movements arrived in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla of their base in the west mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a suite in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990s, after a United Nations peace agreement led to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, large groups of Khmers-Red fighters began to defeat the government, covering the capitals of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died for natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had been headed, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby mountains of Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while waiting for his trial.
Without their benefits, most of the older men of red khmers have fallen into the black mistake, common to the rural regions of Cambodia; and many are the ones who remain nostalgic from the movement.
Although some red khmers elite officers have kept their posts as local leader in exchange of arms, it is non-qualified farmers at low level and file.
"These people have benefited very little after caption," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation that organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are imbounded by the Utopic Agricultural Ideology of the regime."
"They have been raised in a framework where business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, age 55, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, struck in the jungle around Anlong Veng before he was installed in 1998 as a poor rice cultivator.
"Life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"There isn't feeding everyone."
But now, life is hard because we need to submit to our own needs."
The Court of Red Khmers also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of the next year, the court should begin the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of red khmer.
The mandate of the Court is to judge the high leaders and the main responsible for crimes, but he did not say if he continued beyond these four cases.
It would need more to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The last media speculations turned to Im Chaem, 64 years old, an ancient district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the Rhode Khmers in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers of the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had monitored the construction of the Trapeang Thma bargage, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, at a tourist night, Im Chaem returned from work to the field near his house of wood on pilots, on a landway outside of Anlong Veng.
While the sun was casting long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem was discussing his past in the Red Khmers.
If the court called her, she said, she would go.
"The Cambodia is in peace and stability," she said.
"If there are more persecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defeated the Red Khmers in 1978, also warned several times that instability would occur if the court continued several suspicious; although experts and historians contested this.
"The Cambodia must bury a cup and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is all that Cambodia has to do to go before, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation in terms of khmer is to reconnect the broken songs," he said.
"We have to put these songs in order to understand."
The center produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Red Khmers, "A story of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as additional to the historic manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
Like most of the Cambodia, Anlong Veng youths only know some details about the Red Khmers, despite the town's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, age 19, studied at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new manual helped students to understand a major part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They deceive because they don't know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance made the complex and difficult reconciliation process, said Sok Leang.
But the public forsies, the handbook and the court begin to have an impact, said he.
However, the Red Khmers keep a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a way, invaded by the bad grass and parseed of plastic sacs, leads to a black suit rectangle, covered by a rounded toilet.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of pneumonia after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, age 31, a mobile phone seller on road border, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned in this place.
"But he has a great spirit, and many inhabitants are going to pray," she says.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to go to the last place of the rest of Pol Pot where she would leave a bucket of mature bananas in the hope of bringing chance.
Belarus accepts refusing its military quality stock
Wednesday, the Government of Belarus announced that he would leave his stock of ura very rich, a essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is included in a surprise of the campaign of President Obama to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The agreement was published in a couple who had been found after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met the Belarusian Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov, on a top of security.
The American Government has tried for years to convince Belarus to reject the urination and seemed to have disappointed the horizon at the last time.
However, the American responsible stated to Washington Post that certain classified operations have been carried out with Belarus during the last two months to eliminate 187 books of military quality ura from a research center of Belarus.
This opened the way to a Friday agreement to eliminate the rest of the material of approximately 500 pounds, a officer who said the condition of anonymity due to the importance of the question.
The Agreement is one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Supreme of 47 nationals, organized at Obama's initiative, where Belarus was excluded.
It appears that it was beneficial to offer an invitation to the former Soviet Republic after the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security summit of 2012.
"This proves me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, Chairman of the World Security Party, a group for the promotion of nuclear security.
Clinton qualified the "treatly significant, important stage" agreement made by Belarus.
Obama engaged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all sole nuclear materials throughout the world in the four future years.
Since then, the US Government has helped six countries to get away from all their raises highly rich.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A twelve countries did it under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security summit, the Belarus president, Alexandre Loukachenko, said that the nation would never reject his hatred.
"We have kept the time highly rich, hundreds of kilograms of what is mainly military quality and lowly rich," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product... we're not going to make salt bombs, and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research, that's all."
Belarus was drawn up from the United States a few months ago, however, showing the interest to reach an agreement.
The first exercise to eliminate ura of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been fully irradiated, indicated the responsible.
It was loaded on a special train that parked over 1 300 miles up to an installation in Russia to be stored and removed, reported responsibles.
The second operation has been completed Monday and has been carried out by plane, responsible.
The US Government spent 13 million dollars in its efforts, in large part, to replace research facilities from Belarus with lowly enriched ura; inappropriate for weapons.
"One and a minute organization have been implemented to strengthen confidence"; thus leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, a responsible for the Department of Specialized Energy in the World Minderment of the threat.
According to the estimates of the Non-proliferation Study Centre James Martin, Belarus had at least 88 books of military quality, as well as hundreds of pounds of ura very rich.
Belarus is trying to eliminate its stocks from 2012, a joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tendered for years, mainly because of the hard repression by Loukachenko des Human Droits.
But Wednesday statement would suggest a potential renewal.
"All by congratuating progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that a strong respect for the Democracy and the Human Droits in Belarus remained essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The Government has not committed any objection to flights of the
The Government had no objection to the flights of the flight with Talibans and Al Qaeda prisoners in the direction of Guantanamo through the Spanish territory, a telegram of the United States ambassador in Madrid.
This is shown by the filtered documents (cabs) by Wikileaks in the El País daily, which implies that the first president of the Government of that time, Maria Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested the Spanish Executive to be informed "to show that they exercise adequate supervision of foreign aircrafts that passed by Spain".
In June 2006, after a report of the Council of Europe which had complicated in practices contrary to human rights to a twelve countries, among whom Spain, a meeting was held between the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández of Vega.
The President recognized that the Council's report "was surprised the Government of Zapatero outside the game" and insisted on the fact that Spain had nothing to hide.
"The Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over the Spanish territory."
"They are only wanted to be informed" to avoid "the depourvu," Aguirre reports in a cab.
The holder of the Ministry of Externals at that time, Miguel Angel Moratinos, reported to the ambassador that the Spanish Executor "will give the lower profile to this case, even if, as she was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited influence capacity."
At its turn, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Ambassade the fact that he was not worth blocking the initiative of the judge to request declasification of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Defence Minister for Flights.
"These reports contain no inevitable elements, no sensitive information," explained the Ambassade after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the United States have shown their concern for "the appearance of Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of the CNI o of the Defence Minister.
"This among independent researchers will comply with our efforts to handle the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, during a breakfast between the United States ambassador and the Minister of the Internet, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although the Spanish judges are very zealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had given instructions to his guardians "to avoid the comments of a fired retoric, trying to decrease the temperature".
The ambassador also expresses its concern for the action of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will certainly take part of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the United States' actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she reported.
The par’ide that passed to the neighbors was plagued on the "acc" network to be mother
The young girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terreur to the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With that surname that she used when she was small, she was with a cousin and at least one friend; the two origins of Noah, the village of the Coruña whose origin it is.
The messages are dated in 2008.
To hear them, we need to know his emotional life, which ABC builds with the witnesses of her parents.
The 30-year-old Galcian girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tuñez, industrial.
Their relationship spent a year.
Soon after they were separated, we knew that she was deceived.
He wanted to know if the baby was at him, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We discovered another new little friend after that.
The elus was Alberto, a young man of Lousama, a neighbor's community.
With him, she was co-happy for a long time.
Caesar had v with them.
When the young girl went to the Baleares Islands for the work market, the young man stayed with her partner, who even joined her a week in Palma.
But the content of his communications, it is heard that their idyle was fractured, they separated themselves.
In March 2008, she was in Minorque alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and wrecked for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it gave him a good thing, but, of course, he now knows what he wants to mean to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me a address to send the child to you."
She claims, "If she doesn't like this, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I will take it when I come back," she claims.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I'll go, but I'll stay there only until 19, because on 20 I'm going to be present to a job to not lose it."
She explains that if everything was fine, she would have taken her old man with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that's with me, and I will never leave it from my life with another person if this person is not my mother," doubtfully intended, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When she touched it, the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, was supposed to have been dead on the 10th.
"Cesar is pleased with one side, but he is not with another."
"On the other hand he's with me, and this place likes him a little, but from another he's going to the oil almost every day."
She's talking about a move to Ork.
"The kid will go there at a few hours of age, and I'll spare some money from the baby-sitter."
17th, salutations and complaints.
"A very big bishop from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you, I don't know what videos in the mail, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child's good, he's going to be at the summer hours to keep the catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one, "I'm awarded of money."
On the Internet, she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her in the MySpace Universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the freedom of prison."
"Terreur to the Galician (epigraphe)."
The last man who v've been with her, watch, says his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything was happening because she didn't tell her the fact that she was a single mother.
Monica entered the province of Palma yesterday from the center of juice prisoners from Minorque.
The office lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she didn't remember how the facts had happened, "and she didn't have the intention of doing bad to the minor."
Before she had acknowledged that Caesar had noised in the bathroom and put her body in a valise.
Defense and the prosecutor have requested a psychiatric test.
The members of the Popular Party would win 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 18-N, the PP could be crucial in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in votes and votes recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already mentioned the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training is obtained in these double committees normally as it has received in the Catalanes.
Thus, Catalan people received 610.473 votes to the generals in 2008, while in 2006's autonomes, they received 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384.091 votes.
If this growing trend is maintained, desired to decline from the PSC votes and the reliability of the PP electorate, the analystes of this training calculated the fact that if there were general elections, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 Members in the Congress, while the CIA would also win four (now 10) and the PSC would not lose at least 9 members (in 25).
These calculations would find that the catalyst place is adequate for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the population, ERC would lose a Member - he has three of them now - while ICV would keep a member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda remains, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal committees, where the populations may also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemonia in the four province capitals and in their relax to the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulate the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
As well as nationalists and people agree with the fact that the PSC could lose Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona Majority, where the socialists would not have the majority of their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debt, it would not be fantastic that this training would lose its representation in Barcelona Major - 5% of votes needed.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be catagonists of fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist master, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP saved only a difference of 500 votes compared to the PSC, including the Major, Angel Ros, maintains very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they have been found several times.
People have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Casteldefels or Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalogue and encourages lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passengers in Al Qaida
Except the seven prisoners in Barcelona, there were three
The seven Pakistanians and the Nigerian detained by the General Commissioner for the Information Police of Barcelona were a jihadist cell that, guided from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigres for the Liberation of the Land of Tamil" and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last author of Bombay's attacks that caused death in 2008.
The Ministry of Internals gave great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that with "the Kampai operation" the Al Qaida international Implementation facility and "heroin its operational capacity".
Researchers calculate that the cell, during which it was active in Catalogue, could have sent thousands of passengers to Thailand, or they were distributed and then distributed to groups that would integrate the Al Qaida galaxie so that its "fighters" could pass the European borders and other western countries with a total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only thing that the jiadist network was operating in Europe, so that in research, except Thailand services, other European police units, therefore, there could be the following days of the following shopping to the reported on Wednesday night in Barcelona.
With this operation (the Pakistanians Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were held in Thailand, with the capture of the Pakistanians Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thailandian Sirelhelaya Kijbum.
They were those who were leading from Bangkok the inflammated cell in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan network - whose part was hit in 2009 - was mainly stealing from tourists the passports that satisfyed the conditions marked by the World Islamic Front.
This means the documents to be on behalf of a young man between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without printed visa.
Researchers highlight that until now no detail has been found that connects prisoners in Catalogue with the expectation of Bombay, even though the author of this attack, "Lakar e Taiba", was one of the receptor groups of passengers who were stolen in Spain and then held in Thailand.
However, it is necessary to remind the fact that a few days before this attention was made, Catalonia sent through a transfer agency for a few thousand dollars who were "invested" to buy mobile cards used after the "command" integrants who killed 106 people.
The police took a lot of documentation.
PP requests to suspend tax compliance
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity to expose his conditions personally to Artur Mas to support its investment as the president of the Generality, identical to those exposed during the campaign and that reassured to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philosopheral adventures as the economic complexity that the nationalist leader wants to address half of his mandate.
The Chairman of Catalan Populars came to the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact that 18 members have received the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to love, because the CU candidate needs than at least one of the trainings that the opposition will be exercised in the vote of the investment.
A possible understanding with the PP disappoints the future covenants that nationalists want to keep in the Congress during the general elections, but for the moment, the conversations that Mas has with the rest of political leaders are catalan key.
And as regards the President of the PP, to support a investment "will have to eliminate all the sovereignist and independent talks" and the economic complication - similar to that of the Netherlands - which the leader converges wants even to submit to the referendum.
The two leaders in common have their own in order to enhance the political equipment of a very exagered autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of the negotiation on Mas's investment will take place by the PC, Jordani Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Geriatric claims that the dead have not been due to "no action"
The owners of the Centre of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their nightmare killed more than 11 elderly people
The responsibility of the Geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Gerone) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused by the institution by Joan Vila Dilmé's behavior, the infirmary who killed at least 11 persons who were responsible in the interval he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the lawyer of the Centre, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be the one to exercise the accusation against the responsible" for the dead but "the ability and responsibility forces us to deal with the processing situation of civil responsibility".
Besides the social discrimination that the entity can suffer for not to have timely detected the infirmary's activity at night, the great threat to the Carity now takes the form of an important compensation that the representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime was date of 2009 and that since that day he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhibition of eight body - old patients in the geriatric - which he assumed that in many cases no doctor would personally explore the deaths but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality had occurred by phone.
The Caritat, through its director, rejected this situation in a category and mentioned that "the lack of measures could no longer have been the cause of what happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat said that "in this case there is only an index of imprudence from any other person who is not accused."
The person already baptized as "The Angel of Death" admitted 11 years before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 to 2009, and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In that case, he caused him to die by injecting a overdose of insulin, in contrast with the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative palettes.
The Director of La Caritat mentioned that it is complicated to control the access of the staff from the centre to the doctors.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktail were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the infirmary, in his desire to lay the suffrance of the internal, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analysis will clarify if Vila doesn't lie saying that he was looking for his first victims for a less cruel death or otherwise he burned them inside by giving them lessively as he already acknowledged that he had done with the three women he killed during the 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the nurse at night, neither the number of admitted persons, nor eliminate the possibility of the number to be greater and justifie their attitude by the various versions given by Vila in its visits to the First Instance Court and the lack of logic in the change in the way of killing after having succeededed.
That is why they say that they will remain available to justice in order to clarify the facts.
ECB's threat
The investors reacted brushfully to Trichet's threat yesterday, which warned that "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
The different devices have been closed to the force and the actions of the European banks have increased more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not also underestimate the ability of the ECB to be thrown, and the euro is almost acquired of an increasing increasing, which is anxious signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that, in the same way that it turns away, it recovers, but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB has quoted us today to recover liquidity measures and it will have to return tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining years.
Bundesbank requested the conclusion of the debt purchasing plan due to its inefficiency and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures at end and allowing only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures are extended "at least until March" and maintain the sale to quarterly businesses unlimited to the end of the quarter to ensure the liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the obligation purchasing programme and that we will even give the signal of intensifying it.
If they do not comply with the expectations generated, they will reverse the great reaction of the markets yesterday and continue blind to recover the liquidity measures, God will help us!
Like during their meeting in May, when they claimed that they did not even consider the purchasing of obligations and the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be reliable and sustainable.
In May he announced the baseoka on Monday and Thursday he said he had already bought a lot, providing a new shopping on the market.
Yesterday the number of treatments at a year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous inheritance.
Even so, the types in Portugal have decreased 30 base points throughout the corbe, and reflecting on a change in market feelings after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the numbers of Allied and Bank of Ireland were found.
The estimated numbers represent 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potential, and they have a time limit until the fever for private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the numbers are acceptable in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce incertainty.
However, on Tuesday next, the Government will have to approve the parliamentary approval of its new budget and has not yet sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the ton of his speech to release the pressure before the next Summary of the Governing Boss and Government on December 14, where it is necessary to find a political compromise that shows that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the himne of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve Friday.
Reform pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to reactivate employment, such as investors' audiences as Vivaldi's four samples.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Bourse has increased 4.5%, the double of the rest of the European Bourses.
In contrast to February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was quick and radical and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a key to a three-year obligation that will be benefited by the Trichet effort, so we hope that this will re-react with a strong request and help to dismiss doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Assistance Plan, it would be a self-impulsion.
They would give us a line of liquidity we don't need, the Treasur has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, the triple in comparison to March, very dear types and they cut access to free markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be the one of Caesar's wife, "without being, it appears."
Courage, we can get out of it!
The President of Eulen will respond to the Vega Sicilia Council requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict inside the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will answer, because he considers it "nul of right", the next 16 Jurisdial Council of El Enebro, requested by five of his seven sons, in which they will try to make their majority valuable and deal with bodegas Vega Sicilia's management bodies.
David Álvarez and his sons, Jesus David and Mary Joseph, provide their battery for the new chapter of their litigation for the control of one part of the group.
The maintenance founder of business services for companies does not seem to be ready to sit in his litigation to be present in El Enebro's directional bodies.
From its Governing Board, five of his seven sons who were appointed to be administrators in the Acting Assembly of 18 January that year, where the contest is recorded in the Trade and Society Register.
The Court of Justice of El Enebro for the next 16, invited by the Magistrat Commercial Number 2 of Madrid, opened the box of toners in the Alvarez family again.
The complaint to the court to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is renewed, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "depreciated record of the applicants of his five sons to try, through a processual argument, in fraud, and by abusing the Law, validating and correcting the assembly radically none on January 18th", and its official passwords.
This argument will be the basis for, as soon as the assembly is necessary, to be contested, considering that it is "null of full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a silence discretion, have already tried without success as the judge calls for a assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial company of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other actives, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the requested service group, however, benefited from 51% of capital, family protocols.
This matter is the fundamental question that the judge must decide after hearing on the request of a question for which there is not yet a date indicated.
Red Bull triomph in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software created improvements on real-time cars.
As Red Bull entered the world of Form 1 in 2004, his story in this selective universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At the first time, no one took into account the options of a new darkness that had just arrived, despite the rising trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championnat, they all set up on Ferrari triomph of Fernando Alonso.
Without decreasing the ability as a pilot of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, neither the capacity of the Renault engine that propulses its car, in the world of Form 1, we speak of the "secret arm" ́end of the multinational company Siemens in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winner team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very remote objectives from higher automobilistic competition.
The named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly chains of everyone manufacturer, energy stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, simulate the product or process faithfully before building it in a real way, avoiding unexpected deficiencies and costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon's photo apparatus, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous useful vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens Industrial Division, explains the fact that use of this computer instrument in Form 1 has allowed Red Bull to create and exempt "in few hours, almost in real time", changes, changes and improvements detected during courses and trials.
Russwurm explains that 1992's darkness had a average of 10 technicians in their teams that were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team, 180 high-quality professionals work today who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project any kind of changes on the balls.
The manager of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull balls except the engine, which is responsible for Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodinamic and safety elements are changed.
Changes can be passed from the reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, using advanced laser production systems and high claves.
As a single limitation of this foolishness of perfection, there are 40 million dollars that each team in Form 1 can cost as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull implanted the highway tool to create and produce its balls in a location of 50 km from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
All that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty accounts 580 people, two pilots, the Vettel campion and Mark Webber.
The Hero of Red Bull Form 1 is, of course, the recent Sebastian Vetell campaign.
Among the great resources that the brand of energy drinks has made to the service of its participation in circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is inestimable and notority.
The Business Director Steve Nevey states that five years ago it could be said that the progress of R+D in course cars was 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed and 85% of success, while the pilots have 15% of the value.
Nevey admits that the Vettels or Webber will never be replaced by the information, 'for they are implicit gladiators'.
HP′a in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) introduced in Barcelona his first exclusive magazine with his associated Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20 trade network between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational provides in Spain for the next two years.
The company will calculate this initiative with the 16 areas already presented in multimark centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The HP president of Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as example the refunding store on the Great Via de Barcelona, the property of Pont Reyes, with which it has been 30 years old.
The North American group prepared a plan to implant 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, which includes 20 Spanish institutions.
The first opens were those from Bucarest (Romany) and Serbia (Serbia) last week, which was the third of Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even if she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The HM personal system guide has ensured that the philosophy for the implanting of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North-American group advises and takes care of the design of the exclusive magazine mobile (with products that can be interactively touched) which will have the same image in Europe.
Furthermore, HP covers the training of the staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and highlighted that the exclusive trade network was "better the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, assistance, post-venture and even packaging".
The Barcelona magazine includes a space with a worldwide pioneer pilot program that resolves the potential problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
A online service connected to a technical centre in Maastricht, Holland.
"In 10 minutes, we can solve problems that often can take even two days."
"This system is designed especially for MPEs and users because the large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero noted yesterday.
Sabadell paries on 'flow' a million clients to its ́s ́s ́s in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the Delegated Administrator of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the employment sector, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and predestimates the end of the war of ..
However, it provides a decrease of interest margins, which will be tried to share with the increases of the committees and the price of the credit.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years, his task to carry out.
Sabadell has found a way to explore during the three future years and has been able to survive in a very complex economic environment.
The bank will run in 2011 a new director plan that will hold a three-year ability.
The objective, except to survive without need for FROB subventions, is to win a market share by capturing a million new customers - 700,000 if those who can go out of the bank - his great task to carry out, since until now this bank has gained more SMEs and companies than the private client.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 500,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while it is over 10% in companies.
Another basis for the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity comparison, or what is the same thing, of the extent, with the reduction of costs as a goal, which the challenges will be explained by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
A few banks now need to set objectives and make them covered, since the financial crisis has deteriorated all the plans of the world's sector.
Sabadell, actually, will end this year with its plan of director Optima, established four years ago, even if the plan was initially for three years, but the market situation determined its prolongation for a further exercise.
The customers who let the boxes escape will be his main goal.
Pen日 a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted on the fact that 2011 would be a "difficulty and transcendental year".
The exhibitive, actually, thinks that the outcome of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years, it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is important for the survival of the business, it insisted.
And even if he thinks that the war of the employment - which penalises the margins - is reduced, the price of the risk premiums that banks and cashs pay for their emissions for liquidity are already moved to the credit price to acquire the loss of margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is worthwhile and will be a credit pressure factor."
"We haven't locked the robot, but the differences are higher," Guardiola recognized.
Banesto has already ordered its network to limit the long-term credit and to increase the price of differentials - see CincoDias of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in the sector is now "the committees" but "the competitive framework".
The Sabadell Director plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that it ensures that in Spain "the greater dimensions will be requested."
"All will move next year," he assured.
He claims that capital needs "severely" and some Spanish financial entity could enter into red numbers.
And he notes that FROB can replace the market in the capture of funds in the case of new recapitulations.
After assured that Sabadell could survive at the time of the markets, he decreased the importance of some guardians already predicted as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, it can be financed short-term through relaxation, which reduces the crisis.
CECA rejects the possibility of a second box of mergers among boxes
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new vague of boxing boxes and again insisted on the speed with which the revolution of the sector is exhausted.
When the process of concentration of Spanish boxes started, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve themselves for the second phase.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses of Espargnes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of production of this new operating vague.
"I think the largest part of the fuses has been made, it can't be said that Cajasol's incorporation in the Bank Cívica group is a second phase, it's adjustments."
"The majority has been completely achieved; instead of 17, it is possible to go to 13 or 14, but all the large processes have already been carried out under the preservation of the Spanish Bank, which also has committed many in this operation," stressed the leader.
In the statements during a small breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta expressed that the concentration process is being carried out "as far as possible and that we must be very satisfied with the way it is fulfilled in the past periods, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
"The passport of 45 boxes with a average of 28.500 million assets to 17 with 75.500 million is an unbalanced process in the history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much greater to be in conformity with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta recognized that there are "a series of very little happy opinions on the process slow" that show "a lack of seriousness and meaning" because "what the Spanish Bank does is to remind that we must respect the time before the end of the year".
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system in all Europe and "prob" of the world and has assigned to people who doubt it "not knowing".
The leader mentioned that since the current economic conjonction, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and boxes, a system that started a "very important" concentration process and "Go to the greatest speed possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish Sector was well taken from the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but he has established the conditions for the whole Union.
Market pressures caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, which varied from tax reductions for SMEs, the regulation of private movement agencies or the elimination of EUR 426 for unemployed unemployment aid to the privatisation of 49% of the AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, President Elena Salgado, with the support of the former President Felipe González, joined the critics of the Channel Angela Merkel's responsibility to deal with the current crisis.
How should these moves be interpreted?
We must mention that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its policy.
In contrast, it is another restriction to the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what must be his future, which is a shame with the former traditions of most of its partners.
In view of European resistance, in Germany, the three possible crisis outcomes are beginning.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and south would leave the monetary area.
The second is the recovery of Mark, even if this is now of science fiction, with a very favourable opinion-courant, nearly 50% of the population.
Thirdly, a new concept of the euro, online with German proposals for a greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, amendments to countries who translate them, possible suspension of payments from one of them and private costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is determined and it has long been defined, therefore there is no place for excuses now.
In 2009, when both FMI and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought that it should be done (tax-stable plans and stability of financial funds) and what its European partners, France, practiced.
The second course of the Central European country was when Merkel was difficult to extend the decision to save Greece.
Since that time, she has been subject to a feroz criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the opinion and the view of Greece was against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, at the end of October, Merkel again expresses a strong position by requesting the reform of the Treaty of the Union to enable a country's rescue and to oblige private assets to support a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as an anti-European, since it predicted the Irish crisis and the rest.
However, its proposal, although a little edulcorated, was approved and, in the following months, we should assist the reform process of the Union which makes these measures possible since 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that she doesn't think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures that we may not be too agreed, from that date the former function of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which countries who translate rules will be severely sanctified, they may be able to state in the cease of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also support a part of the costs.
Germany reports that we need to follow a severe growth path with high costs and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external sales.
A alternative based on debt and construction, with large covered in payment balance, such as the Spanish growth in the years of boom, will not be just tolerated.
It's appealing.
And it would be bad not to hear it.
It is not only to renew the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we ask is much more difficult.
And what it absolutely doesn't do in these circumstances is to get us to face ourselves.
I hope the current turbulences allow us to reach a greater tranquillity.
And let us know to enter the opportunity we have been given until the early 2013.
The President Zapatero also heard of this form and his double declaration (the reforms promised after the meeting of the last week with the large companies and the announcement of yesterday) suggest that, despite Merkel's critics, the road to the tess was opened.
But the red line that Germany traced is there, and they don't eat it.
And among the possibilities that we consider can't be excluded from abandoning a too severe monetary area of small countries.
And in that case, Germany can always tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraud of law
The Russians similar to Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate enemy but not the will of escape from a sanction.
In principle, the evacuation of two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions Ligue, has made a lot of encouraging on the anti-sport character of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctified by the EUFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the match (which their team had already been winning), the two players decided to lose the time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitr to show them the second yellow carton.
So, and since Real Madrid will end as leader of his group, the two players will fulfil the regulatory sanction during the next match of the banding match against Auxer and will be able to pass without cartons to the next phase.
Finally, the EUFA discipline committee sanctionsed with two matches the team trainer, José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow carton in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, otherwise rather often in the football world.
It is so extensive that it is part of etos, non-written rules, but followed, of this sport.
A part of the debate appeared in the reported case must be the fact that this was a protagonist of the entity of Real Madrid (which in his hymne shows nobleness and honor and in past occasions condemned an amend to its players for analogue acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, which, by Mourinho, has a more distracted history of historic and provoking technicians.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation against the principles of sport, namely if it is committed a violation of law; because they are, in fact, acts respectful with the sports regulation, but are able to choose its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage that they cause to sport.
One of the goods that understand sports mind is the integrity of adverse players, an aspect that has not been put in danger with these actions, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods to which we are allocated with the right game is to avoid that the team of criminal players benefits in a wrong way of the opposite team, which is not even the case.
However, the paradoxal fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not accept that it normally is characterized as a trichery or fraud of the law, because its violation of rules has not been made in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action has exactly tried to be the most evident possible for the penalisation of the arbitr.
They waited and voluntaryly accepted the sanction.
Another question is the type of advantage that criminals receive from the intentional mistakes.
Here it is necessary to find that there is no advantage in the rival and no benefit in the same match, because the result of the action is obviously supposed to leave their own team with less players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match also, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Of course, the benefit is that players will start the next phase of the Champions Ligue without cartons that can threaten their participation to a future match.
But this is a long-term benefit, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be removed immediately and otherwise, with this action, players perform a sanction match and pass to the second cycle of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than the first cycle.
So, burning the scales, it is not so much that it is a benefit.
Finally, these actions are not contrary to the sports mind, which is even part of the adoption of strategic decisions that promote the benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (that would actually be a case of fraud of the law), or they chose instead the time when they were subject to it.
They took a strategy decision without disappointing the penalty or fleeing that.
Although the border between the genius and the fraud of the law is spread, in this occasion I think we have had a genius case.
It appears to me due to two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and the way to send the guide to provoke them.
The evil caused by sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as ethical.
Offensive offers to catch Christmas dinners for groups in NCB
The dictature of the calendar is this year a booking avalanch for the days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed collections by employees who wish to expenditure between EUR 20 and EUR 30.
Like the tour and the lottery, when December comes, the group dinners are also returned before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen ballon for restaurants and diverts in Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have been deployed into an offensive adjusted price to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to expenditure between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or foods, the businessmen and the interviewed sector.
In order to complete the accountability, the calendar of this year (as the night of the Saint Silvestre falls on Friday) has made the requests in the week of 13 December, with a result of a long-term reservation for the few days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing in the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, many companies have removed collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the conjoiture is, they all ask for battle prices, confirms the President of the Gremi de Restauration of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the patronal now does not need to predict how the festivals will be this month.
"The people think much before they book."
"They want to go out but pay much attention to the prices," he said.
The case will be "good for those who give quality to good price and with good service", he reminds, and reminds the customers of the trend to decline with the crisis, so the range around 25 euros has become majority in the request.
In a survey in various center institutions, there is a number of applications for the night of 17th.
The Soteras Group points out that there is an authentic demand boom for this Friday, with the prospect of spending less than 30 euros, which they have answered by adapting their menus to the conjournation, with full forms of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 places in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, the Fund and other), the particularity of the calendar offered more preliminary reservations, even since the beginning of November.
"We did the most impossible to maintain the same prices of the past year, with menus for all goes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they detailed.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, Quu and a total of 23 locals, remain optimist after detecting a score of facturation since the second half and good, even though it is, business perspectives for Christmas.
The sources of the group mention that 18th will also be an hyperactive day at the level of friend groups who celebrate the festivals.
In their six group menus, they had one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget, and the perception that there is a pre-distribution to expenditure for 10% more than the past year rather than to require more details, such as the catalan manufactured wine; the champenois method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in certain companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
From the Patronat Fecasarm (including entities such as the Bars, Restorants and Divertising Association of Barcelona), his president, En Gomà, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and supports that the reservations are globally "animated", even if the customers "maximally negotiate".
This is true, the hope of festivals has not been decreased, unless it is payable, indicates it.
The Pakistan nuclear programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons with "a faster rythme than any other country".
Wikileaks filters confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American Ambassador of Pakistan and the United States State Department filtered by Wikileaks portal confirms the big concerns that causes the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
Furthermore, the clear and sad details of the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North-American diplomatic representatives credited in Islamabad show that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security is "decreased" and that the instatable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "to a faster rythm than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistan nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not gathered, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
The ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, also records in a report before visiting the former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The closeness of certain nuclear installations in the Territory under Taliban attack, the spread of nuclear materials with short sound and the vulnerability of transport of atomic materials."
The major number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered not only by the United States but also by Russia as a proliferant and a reason for maintaining care.
"Pakistan has a staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; given the decrease of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear programs or missiles," said expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with its American homologus.
The new documentation filtered by the Portal of Julian Assange is the more reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the highlighted Pakistanian level of nuclear weapons production.
A retreat from the Ambassade in May, which qualifys as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, supports the following: "Transparence is often inexistent; assistance offers remain without response or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, states that "although the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons to a faster rythme than any other country in the world".
The ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit to the leader of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to understand "treatly" the responsibility that "Pakistan Army must end with the silent support for terrorist groups".
At the Chairman of Wikileaks
Obama will number a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol sends a red warning to follow moves and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complex labyrinthe where it is difficult to have a certainty of facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red warning" to "localize and follow the moves" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Furthermore, this is not new, otherwise it dates on 20 November.
And this has nothing to do with the last filtering of more than four million diplomatic documents in the United States, but with sexual abuse than the Australian faces Sweden.
Moreover, the Wikileaks Creator lawyer, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
On 20th, the international police body with the seat in Lyon (France) issued the order of Sweden, but it did not be public until yesterday, after receiving the employment of the authorities of this country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received the ability to identify or locate Assange "for its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol can't give the order of arrest of a person affected by a red warning, many of the Member States, the organization's explanations, view the network call notes a free way to arrest -- that the national body of the police must accomplish - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as Sweden and ́letter, where it is thought that Assange is located.
The movement was indignant to the lawyers of Assange, who have made a letter yesterday indicating that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder was willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video-conference.
They also remind that Assange requested and received the authorisation to get out of Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Chef of Stalin Security.
"This is a jail, not a perseverance," says the missionary.
Pens that the world is looking for him - and in his mother defends his son's innocentness -- Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he doesn't hide himself.
On Monday, he granted an undetermined interview to the director of the Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he asked the Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for giving orders to the U.S. diplomates by violating the international treaties signed by the United States, it should be rejected," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the Press Secretary of the Blue House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified as "ridical and absurd" the request for demission.
"I am not sure why a guy's opinion should be interested in us," he said for the CNN.
Obama himself charged a high responsibility for the anti-terrorist fight, Russell Travers, to prevent new releases of documents.
The test of President Barack Obama's portfolio to reduce the importance of Assange contrast with the opinions that the political and conservative commentaries declare these days.
Peter King, the Congressist who will preside the National Security Committee since January in the Basse Room, requested the State Department to study the possibility of encouraging Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to construct its funds and to continue to any person who provides contributions or assistance".
More far away, Tom Flanagan, a adviser of the Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has returned to his statements after saying that Assange should be "be "forwarded".
"Obama should transform it into goal and use a flight without equipment or something similar."
A person who did not ask excuses was Mike Huckabee, baptism minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate to the presidency.
"Whoever is in the Government who has filtered information is guilty of traison, and whatever is not a execution would be too friendly punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with eye climbs to Carod's adepts
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote secretly on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós has found the receipt to solve the first internal revolt within the ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The Chairman of the Party is aware of the fact that his demission threat is not sufficient for the adoptions of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now so diluted as his liar and that it cannot absolutely give him headaches that he had with other exhausted corners.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with eye climbs that allow him to blind up to municipal elections.
For the beginning, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers would be able to pronounce its continuity in secret.
By voting bulletins, not by lifting up the hand.
If the carodists want to carry out a certain penalty vote to the President, they will be able to make it without any fear of the repression.
In fact, the rang leader wants to avoid the division image and the submission to his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that it would not be considered more than half one of the votes, but he, without mentioning the percentages, that the result "to Bulgaria" would not be good too.
People near Carod require the President a little more than to put its position on military, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercos controls the maximum body between the congresss.
But because they do not have sufficient majority to force demissions, they will try to agree with the ex-effective a road feed until May.
For this reason, they hope to participate in the development of the strategy reorientation document that the direction will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
It is intended to support Puigcercós in exchange of the promise of that to program the congress for the future of 2011, which leaders consider as a safe fact.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphonia" affects stability and that its goal is to make that once for all the organization is able to wash its lingering room in the family.
In this line, the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog symptomatic results.
In view of the Ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovation thought that the leader would be "in exchange of various goals" is as if it had been done.
And he numbered five, and he highlighted two.
The first, "recomposing" the exhaustive to represent at least 90% of the military, namely new figures from Carod's added sector.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC is liquid once for all the assembly as functioning mechanism.
It therefore defends a reform of the statutes that allows the implementation of the congresss through delegates chosen by suffocation.
Ending with the assembly model, a exception in the Spanish party system, was an exhibition of the Puigcercos team, which has already been fighting in this regard in the last two conferences.
In fact, the conclave convolution of 2008 has loaded the direction to revise the assembly model in a specific conference for the reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains incomplete because the internal marine in the past years did not recommend to address this subject.
Now, without critical sectors in the affair, the time could be good to recover it and close it forever.

China maintains the objectives of reducing fuel gases
The representative of this country in the COP16 assured that its country had made great efforts to reduce the carbon trace and detailed that it maintained its offer to reduce up to 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent its emissions of combustion gas.
China maintains its offer of reduction from 40 to 45 per cent of its gas emissions before 2020, assured Su Wei, representative of this country to the COP16.
In its first appearance in the 16th Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made great efforts to reduce the carburant trace and to restore its industry.
In fact, he exposed that his country has invested $245 million in the last four years in the efforts to reduce the emission of gas emissions.
However, he mentioned strictly that China would not have its objectives, but it would continue to work with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institutions and pilot programme support.
In all these areas, the approval, last year, of a new Energy Law, which recognises the objectives in the reduction of combustion gases, explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the Federal authorities worked in a coordinated way with the governments and locals to achieve energy sparing objectives, energy use and emission reduction.
Furthermore, it stated that there are various multiannual plans currently or completed, both financed by the Chinese government and by the Governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Effective Use Programme, which was involved in the past five years and who received investments from the United Nations, the Government and the Private initiative.
There is also a provinced project of climate change, another for the change of incandescence lamps by economic lamps and another attempt and adaptation.
At the same table, Martin Krol, Scientific Advisor of the Government of this country in relation to climate change, assures that China's efforts were greater than what we think.
For example, he exposed that the emission per capita of combustion gas in China is three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made an effort without energy use, how to increase the energy capacity 20% in the last five years and intends to make it a similar to 2020.
Spino's expulsion: César Nava
The national leader of PAN stated that the elderly panist manager has the right to address the Commission of Order National to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured the exil of Manuel Espino Barrientos and the former panist leader has the right to address the Commission of Order National to claim what is right.
In the previous interview of the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as a Governor of the State, he said, in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission of Order de Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, by making a claim to the Commission of Command of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it was not the time to think in 2012 and that there was never a covenant on the negotiation table for the presidential candidature.
Nava Vázquez concluded that national action would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December, where a follower should be chosen.
"This (a covenant in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiation table, at least for the moment, was an approach to local elections that have succeeded and reached its goal," he mentioned.
The panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported for 71 years of dialogue, therefore "the internal competition does not fear us; on the contrary, "we will make it stronger and stronger," he said.
He said that the Council would certainly be able to elect the best leader and national action needed for the following three years, so he would give the reference "to the person determined by the Council".
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'd be proud to leave the president office of the party to any of the five."
He planned that the renewal of the party to the elections last 4 July would be reflected on the next dispute, even though "is not the time to think at 2012."
"For the moment it is to join Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he emphasized that the three governments who are committing covenants in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that "the hopes of them have been made, and I am sure Gabino will be at the height of the expectations".
When the Pris criticisms were asked against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, Caesar Nava asked the prize to consider the six years of the former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas of Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that Zedillo y Salinas governments have been better than those of Fox and Calderon; that they begin to defend them; that they are out of armor," he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he did in his speech in the National Audit, because there is no bailon in the country, and less of censure.
Obama promises on Twitter law for students without paper
"If you agree with the approval of the Law Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitte, the American President in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama has meet today with national mobilization to support the Law Dream Act, to adjust students without paper, with a message in its personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree with the approval of the Law Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitte Obama said.
His short message maintains an open cybernetical link with a closer document that requests the public to contact Senators immediately, since the vote to legislation is imminent.
"with a vote we hope soon, now it's time to listen to your voice," he reports.
The message was published after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the reductions of taxes in Bush's time and the financing of the Government was extended.
Such blocking, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Law Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
On the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, the President-in-Officer Robert Gibbs said that it is confident that when the fiscal problem is resolved, a agenda for the rest of the projects can be established.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we must solve this fiscal problem before the end of the year..."
"I think we can agree at a time given in this sense and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the majority of the Democratic Senat, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he was going to ask for a "debating vote" for the Law Dream Act, the reason for which the initiative to enhance non-paper students could be voted from Thursday in the Senat, even if the most ­ was the next week.
The Senatorial Version of the Dream Act or the Law of the Reign of America would identify 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before 16 years, remained in this country in the last five years and were accepted by a higher educational institution or the Army.
But the parties need 60 votes to approve the initiative, for which they need the concurrence of a large number of Republicans, at the time when the partisan organisations of the protagonist project are an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Law.
The democrats, most of whom the Dream Act supports, have 58 places.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson de Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republician expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar de Indiana.
That is why the Parties of the Dream Act need the vote of several Republicans if other democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most shorted Republicans there are Senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the Senator George Lemieux, from Florida, who completed his mandate Senator Mel Martínez.
Other republicians who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Ha, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hu'inson, Texas, but said that they would not support it in another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined its posture until now.
Although the Room of Representatives has a different version, the analystes agree with the fact that the greatest obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senat.
With literature putting the finger on the plague
The second stage of the Plaisirs of the language was a promenade in which the participants have made the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand, but... the finger on the plague? what hopes I?" asked Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Plaisirs of the language, a cycle that praises the literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of his question (after another chair the round table was dedicated to the Sex in the language, explained it).
The finger on the plague "...we put in the embarras," doblely launched the argentinian to the public, most of the young people, who were gathered at the International Forum of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderated table by Marisol Shultz and in which they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "play" is, she goes from a doctor to another, without a response, only tracks in the same story.
From the infectionologist, she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strong, maybe she is my plague."
Finally, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his dust in the midst of the cowler, but who explains that the plague is not a scientific term; it is the psychanalyst who reveals the mystery: "The plague is what is open in reality, the symbol is the cicatric."
The protagonist suspicioned and concluded: "On the plague I could only know that it is open in reality and that it doesn't exist," but convinced that the pleasure and the feet of the language must be very connected.
Valenzuela, the actor, played with both.
The Nicaraguayen Sergio Ramírez also expressed a ravissing narration that he entitled Eloge to the invention, where the finger on the plague is not numbered but at a given time is covered.
With magical realism keys, he speaks of an ensorceous who touched clouds, returned people who had gone far or rebuild vertus that a lady had lost, a narration that came to speak then to America, the great news that had since the beginning of his own chronics and quoted at Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the excess of the narrations of the conquering captains.
"The people who invented all of us (the writers) were mocked of false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a furious way we would never have counted the story of America with an imagination that even missed the potter."
However, he stressed, "The fools and men have the best imagination" and here the reality converge with the lie, we know no more what part of the narration belongs to a band or another, where the fiction literature reaches its apogment.
This is actually called the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to his inheritance that we are what we tell."
At its turn, Mayra Montyero announced and approved the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table He must be on the plague.
The Portuguese Cubaine has put its on the great plague of social violence that its country cross - and Latin America share - produces disputes on trafficking and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poesy, good songs refers to a tactful commitment that is not sure primarily," she said, after mentioning that the reality of literature is communication and the size of the commitment between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the last.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish Poet Luis García Montero, who also highlighted "this must be on the plague of the engaged 日an".
He felt that in a world that lives in great speed, as well as in the context of intellectual habits and the control of consciousness that turns to the benefit of dogmatism, "There is a small none and behind each negative, there is a small yes."
"In order to be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we have to gnash: and gnashing means many times putting your finger on the plague and dealing with those who feel very comfortable by thinking in carcature, white and black, in ideas established and without notion, and to deal with the powers that prefer a white and black world," he said, inviting them to get the sense of writing.
Romano at his first title
Ruben Omar Romano had three deficiencies in the finals he had high and lower in his career, but he learned to reach the decision-making series three times.
With the dual of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, there are also two different characters that are confronted, marked by their technicians, which find among them a contrast marked by the results.
Ruben Omar Romano had three defects in the end, he had high and lower in his career, but he knew to reach the decision-making series three times, even though he did not set in the thousand until now, and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentin ended by comforting himself with the subchampion medal, he left a step behind the winners and carefully with the same team he played consequent finals.
The sensitive strategy reached its first end as an entrier in the 2002 Tournoi, when he kept the dreams of Morelia with which he lost with a global result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Cloture he also arrived to the decisionful dual and again lost with the global result of 3-1 and it was exactly against Rayados.
Avec Santos Laguna already, in the Bicentenary Tournoi 2010, again against the Devils, Ruben suffered a turn again, because his team made a match of 2-2 against the Chopéeros after 210 minutes of game, but in the series of penalties he received a benefit for 3-1 with two opportunities for the title and finally three of his players spent 11 meters and suffered the shopping at the result of 4-3.
Ruben lost two ends with the Red Diablos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournoi, so he doesn't want to have the same outcome, he tries to get out of the malfunction to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he claims that the institution is more important for him.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have, and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the timoner when asked him what his weak points would be in the ends.
He remembers many of the final end, of which he assures that he has learned many things, "the only lesson we can keep is that until the arbitr is the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, also players, because the last time, with two penalties to throw, we were already ready to run and I think that this is a lesson, before the end of the match we can't celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry about it, because he trusts his players: "We are never trying to reach the series of penalties, we are trying to end in the regular time, but sometimes we are only prepared, the previous tour we have been prepared, unfortunately the destination has made us a bad tour, sometimes emotions or anxiety to keep the title between our hands, he has escapped us, it has served us as a lesson for this end, and we hope that we will not come in that situation anymore."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a subchampion technician and to buy the glory offered by the titles for the first time.
The European Union changes the rules for the obtaining of visa
People must go to the Service Centre for Visa Questioners before their interview in the Consular Section; the time of waiting will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the procedure for the treatment of visa at the Ambassade and consulars of the United States will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of the applicants must be presented to the Visa Question Centres (ASC, its signs in ↓) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the biometrical information of the applicant, which will be revised by the Consular Section before interview.
The new procedure will provide some advantages for the aspirants, among which the following are mentioned:
The total cost for the treatment of the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to pay for a meeting, another payment for the treatment of the visa and another for the provision of the court service of the document.
The aspirant will carry out a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current tariff will remain the same: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars in the case of visits with request (including visuals for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for commercial and investor visa.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to be interviewed with the Consular Representative, but they will only be presented to the closer ASC where they will present documents and their prints will be taken.
Because biometrical information will be taken in the ASC, the applicants who want a second meeting to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain less than before.
Similarly, Visum applicants in the Consulats of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo are no longer paying the additional service tariff of $26.
For further information on the new procedure to request the visibility, see the following page http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the outermost life coverage
The United States Space Agency quoted the press to present a cover tomorrow that will affect the research of living in the space.
The National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will be tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented in a conference of press tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 at the NASA seat in Washington for astrobiology experts, the science studying the origin, evolution, distribution and the future of life in the universe.
When she cited the press, NASA assured that she would present who would have the impact on the search for outermost life, which resulted in speculations from experts from other countries.
The discovery could show the theory that there are similar creatures to us and in enemy environments that we thought and put on the table the opportunity to become intelligents like humans if its life conditions are improved.
It is that we are talking about a microbe covered by Mono Lake in the National Yosemit Park, California, who lives in a environment that we thought too coming for any form of life because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any way, the creation uses arsenic as a way of life, and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that have no voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that there is another life form, a second form of life, different from what we know."
The Space Agency will have the real port of the discovered in the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
At the conference, the Geobiology of Pamela Conrad, who studys the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest satellite of Saturne), will be involved in the perspective that its chemical is similar to the earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergence and 'Block' pattern opposing
With reforms in the Organizational Law of the Congress, the "bipartism" array is possible.
The 60th century was installed when a contrary block appeared in the Congress by the members of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, which said independently and the four questioned one thing: the archae of bipartism in the Rooms.
Before starting the 60th session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, were "tone" against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they repeatedly initiated bipartism because there are now two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four Members, by Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, co-ordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the president of PANista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as a president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these reforms constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI for the scheme by providing a political will and if they did not, they would be reserved by both parties and thus will end the opposing coalition.
"Though it has come (the opposite coalition), it is what I consider, because we are excluded from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences, and that is why they form a multilateral group.
The Congress, after being monopolistic, or now "duopolistic".
"This is not the spirit of reform of the law that there is a eternal bipartism in the Congress."
In the beginning, this group starts with 5 isslators and they now speak to others so that they are more numerous, the Convergent has increased.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that the Congress has now been transformed into a "butin" between two, making appeal to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one place, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo requested to respect the member's personality and to give him its place to the negotiations tables.
"If they do not leave with cupular agreements outside 5 which will probably be 9 Members, now at the five of us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to join ourselves to seek a place in the negotiation table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have made, which they have decided, we are outside and we are not agreed with that reform."
$200 more for "the supplier"
The Marie de Mazatlán pays another check to the owner of the electrical material company.
Another check of approximately 200 miles of weight for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Marie.
With this, the amount paid to the owner of the electrical material company is 1 million 200 miles weight.
According to the Municipal transparency page, the latest check number 9258447 was issued last 16 November for the amount of 200,000, 144.56 weights, as the concept of "supplying accounts".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno said that the Community would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Supreme Auditor to sell at a higher price.
What is not reported is the total debt and therefore, how many checks will be made for Camacho Palazuelos.
"We haven't bought anything, it's just paying him what we have to do to him, as the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "recommended" the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been held in the State Official Journal, the provisions of the Law when a company is asked by ASE to avoid other governments using its services, the Treasury assured that they had not re-used its services.
All this, after the 25th July of Northwest, had made a review of the checks which the Marie issues to its suppliers, showing that in March 2008 - July 2010, in the Trinity of Maire Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipe of Palazuelos paying over 10 million weights, through 42 cheques.
He also performed transactions with Jumapam, with more than 3 million weight cheques.
Tourist sites must be cared
Tourist undertakers regret the age of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada round in Mazatlán.
After buriing a foreign tourist in a cover of the Sánchez Taboada Round, the Mazatlán tourist sector asked the authorities to take attention to areas and sites that are in bad conditions and design a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, reminded that they have asked several times that the image of the destination should be cared and that new activities should be replaced by the other than the tourists.
He said that the bad state of streets and trottoirs had been affected because tourists are coming in there and see the deceit and avoid near commercials.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the happiness we lose, otherwise they did not work for such a long time and without a suitable planning."
Hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance from the Marie.
"The municipality will have to carry out its responsibility and avoid that it happens again, how to do it, therefore, through a preventional maintenance and not just to correct it," he said.
"We want to enjoy a own city, because not only because it is a tourist area, but as a people who deserve a clean place to live there, and the Marie has to change its strategy to maintain the city."
There are other sites that are disappointed and incomplete, he said, for example, Escudo and Venadito of Mazatlán.
"Aauourd today, because the tourist comes, it does not only depend on promotion, there must be a good product, a city with cleanness in its beaches, bulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"We didn't give them the attention necessary and this type of facts highlights something that is important for all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under the Secretary of Tourist Promotion, said that the recovery of Mazatlán tourist sites is urgent because they are not correctly used and designed a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be online with the municipality and to be a priority to have the city updated, clean, ordered and attractive because it has a tourist call.
"Happy Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that should be ordered from board, cleaned and set online to make them attractive to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP requests results in the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, proposed that the Members should have the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa due to various challenges.
Mazatlán's business sector requests a worth and free work legislation between the parties and the Governmental Ex-Office, since Sinaloa is convulsed and confronted with big problems.
Yesterday, the 60th islator was installed by seven political forces, 19 PAN members, 13 PAN, three of the Parties of the New Alliance, two PRDs, one of the PTs, one of the Convergence and one of the PVEMs, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of experts that the new integrants of the Government Congress are a private and involved management with the society and the various sectors needing a responsible islative work and that the same patterns of partial or parentalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, proposed that the Members should have the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa due to various challenges.
"We hope that the Members actually exercise their rights, free of agreements between the parties, because the custom is that they make agreements to ensure their own interests and transform themselves into carnaval mask of Governants and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to certifie the commitment to establish the necessary points that the Governing Board makes progress.
"We will ensure that they do a dignity and particularly engaged in society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their trust vote in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Three Islands, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and guard forces by seeking the economic growth of the State, since the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important is that they promote economic growth, generate investment and infrastructure stimulation, and this will in a way stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourist activity, he asked the new islators to give her the importance she had in the Government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that it was the second State Secretariat with a lower budget and that it is inconsistent as a major economic and generative activity of deals and investments and which directly rivals with agriculture."
Furthermore, it is necessary to classify resources to detonator tourist projects that help to provide security to the State and update the Alcohol Law that the previous issues could not solve.
They're looking for king magic.
Poupes, cars and bicycletes, among other players, are the desire of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next day of the Kings of Mages will be difficult to carry out their illusions, because their home is not more than 12 people and a hair.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, Joseph Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, Joseph Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the games and clothes they want.
The family lives a humble house of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live daily because their father does not have a stable job.
"It's sometimes very difficult for us, because my husband has no job, but we sell mandarins and patates... and afternoon I'm out with the "plabes" to sell in the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, four years old, wants a powder or a bicycle, and his sister Isabel, three years old, wants a powder Barbie.
At his turn, José Alfredo, 10 years old, has been aspiring to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), "I'd like to have this monster," but I said to him, "We'll see, my son," because he was very dear," he remembered with triste Cayetana.
For older children, who were in the oil, clothes and chaos would be the ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, 11 years old, was thrown the size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, was thrown the size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, was thrown the size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a couple of sport chaos, so a couple of the size of five and half or six would help him much.
If you want to help really make the dream of the Coronado Valenzuela family children, you can participate in the On Search Roi Mage campaign by giving a play or money to the Northwest receipt.
14 Summary of drug trafficking arrested
A decision of perquisitions was carried out in Estonia, Wednesday, in the context of the demantering of a production and sales network.
Fourteen persons have been arrested and will be confronted with various events.
The surroundings were deployed in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have served for drug production.
"And about 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of haschich, money and equipment that are for production have been entered," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security password.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two leader heads of this network, two Sherbrooke men.
The people arrested to compare to Sherbrooke's justice palace in hours after their arrest.
They could face cannabis production, ownership in order to make traffic, complot and service flight, among other things.
These consequences occurred after a long holiday survey, which lasts nearly a year.
"This is the information received from the public that allowed us to proceed to these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers of the Regional Research Module of Quebec Safety, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memprémagog Police Region participated in this police operation.
Clandestine can continue without a problem
The draft law of conservators, which, by the Government, should resolve the problem of the battles loaded by clandestin migrants, is evident that it is done while the three opposition parties reported on Wednesday that they cannot support it.
"I'm strongly supported on the Chart."
"I stand with a party who created the granite under your feet," said Liberal Chairman Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by members after the weekly meeting of the cacus.
Liberals claim that the draft law, as proposed, which would allow all persons from a ship identified as a transporter of Clandestin immigrants to violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Chef of the Chebecois Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also pointed out that he could not support the project of law because he was taking it to the wrong goal.
"We are against, and it is that all parties of opposition are opposed, then we will see what the Government will do," Mr Duceppe said.
The NPD's criticism in immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticisms of the hand that wished that its party should not be quite closed about Clandestin immigrants.
"Neo-democrates agree to take measures against Clandestins passengers and that is what we do through another law project, C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We are not supporting the draft conservator law because it takes it to the re-employed and captures the children for at least one year," Mrs. Chow explained.
The Ministry of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused the parties of opposition to play politics and ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians say massively to the Members that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine, these ambitional operations that target Canada and treat the country as a paillasson."
"They expect Canada to take closed measures," reacted Minister Kenney.
The Government did not announce a confidence vote on its draft law, which could lead the country to elections coming to its rejection.
A conservator, however, said to the QMI Agency that the Government would ask for a vote to make each member who is opposing himself explained to his electors.
The new unit does not make a singleness
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and the consequences by Jean Charest, many observers continue to ask for the creation of an investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister for Security, supports that this idea did not date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Research Department on this subject since January.
Metropole has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the Tuesday announcement surprised more than one.
It should be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Police Services of Quebec on 29 October, this measure has never been discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
It was no longer necessary that the peculiar security criticism, Stéphane Bergeron, qualify this announcement of "lapin out of a head" and "brickled resolution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those fearing that political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You're going to see the result when we're going to announce it, he's happy to say."
"We are aware of that problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of an investigation.
"More Mr. Charest does not want to create this investigation committee, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have an investigation committee is Jean Charest's demission," explains Yves Boisvert, Ethical Professor and Government at the National Administrative School.
In order to get out of this pass, he therefore suggests Quebec to give a special mandate to the general verifier in order to investigate about corruption and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the General Verifier," he claims.
He also considers that Quebec could give the verifier the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing him to oblige people to witness.
The creation of a permanent school is not the only project in the Charest Government's cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa of ↓ the Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would be carried out by the prosecutor of the Marteau Operation, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fornier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Ministry of Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that Rob Nicholson, his office of Justice, was currently concerned about certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During the 2001 printemps operation, who struck motorist groups, even if the Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa then adopted the Gangsterism Law.
High monitored rivers
Several water courses have remained highly monitored because of strong predictions that have been overcome in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landscape occurred Thursday afternoon, in Shawinigan, Maurice.
Two houses were evacuated in preventive manner.
In the evening, another glying would occur in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road has gone away.
From Tuesday to Thursday evening, strong precipients were scattered in several regions, or from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimeters of additional rain were expected from here Thursday evening, regions.
Sectors north of the River and the Valley of Ottawa were the most touched.
They could get up to 100 millimeters of rain at all.
As these precepts must be added to the source of snow already accompanied in certain sectors, there are fear of the deployment of several water courses.
The Quebec Civil Security for the Ouareau and the Achigan Worships was issued Thursday evening.
The North, Saint Jerome, the Laurentides, and the Chine, in Lotbinière, were subject to innering guards and remained under control.
In the Lanaudière region, the strong precipients led to the debordement of certain lakes in Saint-Julienne, Saint-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary pont was taken because of strong rain.
Ten residents had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, some lakes have caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
Civil security remains on a warning feet and monitors the situation nearby, said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Cross Provision Centre has for its part shown on Wednesday the warnings of strong strongs, including Maskinongé, The Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partly blamed dupont
The radio animator of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has made a part in front of the Canadian Radio Television Council standards (CCNR) for conflicting issues on social assistance and the Haitians as well as on its gross language in walls.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some points contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, induely negative representations of the Haitians and the major language that does not correspond to issues spread during the day".
The Council also concluded that a debate on suicide, including the spread of the name of two self-suicided persons, did not violate the radio-diffusion codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints on comments made between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after a complaint from the Common Front of the Social Assistents of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the emission were inaccurate.
Animators must provide solid information rather than false.
About suicide, the animator Stéphane Dupont thought that suicide was a lake gesture.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the vehicleed message was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the "Dupont the midnight" episodes have addressed a delicate and appropriate issue."
There was therefore no illness at its place.
The last claim was on statements that followed the land tremblement in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a median face that had caused many reactions.
The CHOI animator said he had done no gift to help the Haitians because we could not know with certainty that the needed people would really receive money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative impact constitutes an indignate representation of the Haitians.
"I've already cleaned my suspension for three days."
"My dossier is virgin for a year and a half," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee refers to the broadcast of a green language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM radio dispenser has "forwarded its obligation".
The consequences are minimised for the station which, inter alia, must announce these decisions once during the hours of great hearing within three days.
A king of the Kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian Montreal Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special park.
The excellent athlete in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and Thai boxing up on the tattoos and rings of the world seeking new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, Zemmal explained, installed in the metrol since 2008 to develop in professionals."
"In my case, I seek fights somewhere, because for those who do not love the game in the earth in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security agent and as committed for UPS has just delivered bad news to his ancestors, with two gold medals in the World Karate and Kickboxing World Championship (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edimbourg, in Ecosse.
"I got the category of kickboxing full contact and Thai box, explained he."
"Now, I'm ready to go to China for the Soundshoo World Coup."
"The warriors who ended among the first four in the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I got the bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended the eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I concluded the tournament at the fifth range, while I arrived the third to Toronto in 2009."
"What is interesting is that I have progressed in every competition."
"To this time, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where pound and foot coups are authorised, as well as projections in the ground.
Duels are originally rolled on a platform and rarely in a ring.
The most renamed pugilist of this fighting form is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly answer his presence to the super tournoi "King of Sanda", the Super Bo of the kung-fu.
"This competition is the most highest and most prestigious in China, explained the sympathic gayard."
"This is a little equivalent to the Lumpinee Stade (the largest stage in Thailand)."
"This was a great experience."
Zemmal received his first fight, in half-final of its category (80 kg), before he lost the end.
"He who won me was a real pro," he analyzed.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of half-finals are finally confronted with their category."
"Therefore, the winners of each category are made to coron one champion, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without offers
Hydro-Quebec granted 450 million dollars in contracts to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this avalanch of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor firms who received the most important, the project management, for a sum of $295 million without offers.
This consortium called Energy Management was consistently constituted in 2004 with Hydro-Quebec's choice to grant its responsibility to the private sector to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Consortium Energy Management distorted the profitable contract without a public call.
For the Chebeco Partie, the resource to business consortiums is a serious ethical problem that risks the competition and results in increased prices.
"This is the new way to make the competition and to destroy."
"It means that people, instead of doing this secretly, now do it openly," said Pequist Deputy Sylvain Simard yesterday in press-reference.
In the early morning, Mr. Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he said hard to see how the interest of the public can be used in this way.
The Ministry of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied at afternoon, and not worthwhile for this contract.
"I'm starting to get my journey," she pessed, supporting that the PQ had been "wrongly" and "not worthwhile".
She said, "It would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologize.
The formula of consortiums is a coherent practice worldwide.
It is usually a limited covenant in time that allows two or more companies to group their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for a complex project.
The Eastmain project conducts a high level of complexity accounted for the width of travels.
The sandwich is running and has to go out until 2012.
However, the contract was granted without the competition game; there was negotiations.
The formula of consortiums is therefore no longer a exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As shown in the last week The Debt, the formula of consortiums in the genius-consequence sector is subject to an investigation of the government.
A quick survey of Quebec's business registry allows more than 200 consortiums, including some permanently.
Thus, the company Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are tens, leads to one and even a moral person, or Dessau.
For the Consortium Energy Management, Minister Normandeau highlighted that "the Territory of Baie James is responsible for special work dynamics and that Hydro-Quebec is responsible in particular since the 70s".
The large patron of the project Eastmain, Real Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), made an explanation that stressed the fact that the project management contract was granted in favour.
"If you go to offers and there are few suppliers, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: whether you take the people in that market and say, we will negotiate a satisfying understanding and a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important, it is the competence of people," Mr Laporte said.
This contract granted to the Consortium Energy management is part of a long list of contracts of over $50,000.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After checking, the Debt complied with 109 genius advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or branches, including land laborers.
SNC-Lavalin discussed 22 contracts, Genivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without computing its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the Energy management contract of $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard has heard that the four firms composing the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor) are "aware of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has allowed that the PQ is also linked to those firms who "finance" before it states that it is not the leader of its leaders.
Consumption Barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but honestly skeptic.
The Chebeco consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also on equitable marks and certifications to guide its choices.
Pis, even if it is in a median universe where messages for a more responsible consumption are deployed, it deploys a lack of reliable information, unless it even qualifys of freshness to its commitment, indicates the Barometer of the responsible consumption, which was delivered yesterday.
Although they have increased the consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, the Quebecois are able to grant very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say that they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as the Green Publicity of Companys, shows the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Consumption Responsible of the Sherbrooke University.
Other evidence: the half of consumers doubts the reliability of official certifications based on proper products but also the credibility of products and marks which are as adequate, indicates the Barometer.
In the same case, the political talk on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecois.
The information on the responsible consumption, however, is primary to stimulate this pain of consumption currently animated by near the third of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, the empty and doubtful character of information would calm 46% of consumers.
This is the second rain identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
Furthermore, one third of Quebecois is also defiant to the allocated performance of the green products or services they are seeking to put them in their hands.
On another note, consumers were nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habit and, in particular, changed the mark of one or more products to respond to their conviction.
At 61 per cent, they also favored purchases to traders in their quarter and privileged purchase of food cultivated in their region, indicating the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumption has reached 64 over a maximum of 100 for this year - the Quebec consumed Homo loves to be present as the king of recycling who wants to reduce its environmental print by concerning the protection of animals.
However, his social and  géological conscience remains outside its car, indicates the Barometer: in 2010, almost 28% of Quebecois indicated that they used the transport in common or preconceived the covoiture to defend their green interests.
The walk and the veil were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this broad behavior investigation, which just took its first clip.
A State loan for eXcentris racket
The Government of Quebec, who was requested to engage financially in the racing of eXcentris film complex by the Society and the Parallelle, accepts to be acquired, but only in competition with a loan.
The Development Society and the Parallelle, who hoped a donation of seven million dollars from the Culture Ministry to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex on the Saint-Laurent Boulevard by giving him his full kinephile vocation, did not get what they claimed.
The Government accepts to be involved in the dossier, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would otherwise be lower than the initial expectations, which could constitute a sustainable solution to advantaged conditions, at least the opinion of the sources issued by the State officers.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec in the last year, but the requests have been reviewed at the latest.
A proposal and a action plan was sent to the Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Cultural Development Society (SODEC), François Macerola, who pilots the eXcentris dossier.
He made him a last report a few days ago.
But the opposite of the cabinet reached the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallele and Others have to answer it until 31 December.
However, it implies that the hypothesis of the State's gift must be truly separated.
Remember that Quebec's Association of Films and Film Parks opposed a direct investment of the State to support the eXcentris racket, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance immobile projects, which he did not for other film rooms.
However, many environmental intervenants claimed a sustainable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the chief of censes, has been carrying the author film in its places of the complex after financing himself his construction, which could justifie a derogation from the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent movies is crying to Montreal, and eXcentris had been loyal to his client.
The Society and the Parallelle, with their Christian Yaccarini head, pilot, on their side, a private funding campaign, expecting to collect $700,000 to move to the road of the acquisition.
Since 2009, one of the three screens, The Parallelle, continues to spread movies to eXcentris.
The purpose of the future purchasers is to open the three rooms on the next 27 February by designing the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remind the Debt and we ignore what he and his group think of proposals to be done to them.
The wheel raised on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables spread by WikiLeaks raise the voice of what the United States view as the inflation complex of the Canadians against the Americans, but at the same time they make the feeling of surrounding those last to Canada.
The American diplomates thus surprise that every Canadian elector has not the Canadian-American relations by voting and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative Government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the American ambassador in Ottawa and Washington, standing on the place yesterday, provide more cross-style details than the substantive content to be put under the teeth.
A cab of 22 September 2008, whether in a fully federal electoral campaign, relates to how much the United States are not part of the consequences discussed by the political leaders.
At the great surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides some explanations on this situation.
"A complex of Canadian inflation may almost inherit the Canadian political leaders to talk about internal injuries of the day rather than to bring this election on the United States (as during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign). "
The United States are, therefore, "the elephant proverb of this election: all representatives, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands so less that "assuring silence" that both countries have a close political and economic relationship.
"It is logically considered that the capacity of a candidate, one party and more than a leader of the party to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that the electors have in mind by voting."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the cabine sent by Terry Breese on 22 January 2009, carrying business in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for its first visit in Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure the survival of the government during the beginning of the trust vote on the federal budget, by which Canada will show its first deficit more than a decade due to a 30-40 billion dollar recovery plan," wrote Mr. Breese.
No part mentioned that the Government had to prolong the Parliament before Christmas to avoid being reversed by coalition and that the opposition parties had a conditional survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, prevents Washington from the more negative image than the dramatic series spread to the CBC return from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Emissions Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where we observe little subtil references to Maher Arar, No-Fly-List, or even to the exhibitions for muscle interrogations from ↓.
Another cab relates that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French authorised Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to take some prisoners in Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the " case per case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "He sent a paper to the state secretary about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary accepted revision of the dossier."
Let us finally note that the spirits are exhausted about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a very close adviser of Stephen Harper, stated on the CBC walls that the responsible for this massive escape should be "seen".
Mike Huckabee's echo in the United States.
A global plan to renew lighting
The United Nations proposed yesterday a plan for renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries in Cancún to reduce heat gas effects (GES) which corresponds almost to the thirds of the additional reduction that is needed to be made to stabilize planet climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is held in the broadcast of the large concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún in order to guard the absence of commitments to reduction by industrialized countries.
According to the yesterday schedule, if the incandescent ampoules that are still monopolious from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact ampoules or, better, by electrical diodes ampoules (DEL or "LED"), the essence of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES issued on the planet would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen, last year, large issuer countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have been involved in voluntary reduction plans that should lead to the global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it will be necessary to submit this balance to 5 Gt to stabilize the increase of climate to 2 degrees from 2020 to avoid being out of control.
In incandescent ampouls, 95% of energy is discharged in the form of heat and the rest, whether 5%, produced from light.
With fluocompact ampoules, the energy cost is decreased by 75% and with the new ampoules on it, this energy need is decreased by twice again.
Fluocompact ampoules take in average from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new ampoules at the deal, like those that the manufacture started this week Philips - this company also participated in the United Nations study - have a life hope of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent ampoule, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new ampoules can also work with reostates rather than educate very little warm.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown reserves in the place of fluocompact ampoules because they contain the mercure and that they must be removed as dangerous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers place consignments.
However, the report indicates that the main source of emission of mercure on the planet is not the fluocompact ampoule, but the thermal centres of carbon, which produce many mercure to produce electricity in incandescent ampules.
In the United States only, these centrals issue 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the profits each country would be made through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would evacuate a billion dollars per year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, either the equivalent of 3.5 thermal centrals of which the construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects in nervousness to announce electoral results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, requested the publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the expiry of the fixed terms.
"The Secretary-General emphasises the need for the independent electoral committee to finish his work and announce the provisional results without a longer term, underlined a portfolio of the United Nations leader's password."
"He requests all Ivoire parties and institutions to demonstrate responsibility and to avoid any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressures exercised by certain foreign governments, the electoral committee allowed the swimming date of midnight without results, three days after Sunday audit.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the time limit, the CEI Chairman had stated at the television that the committee was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
The calls were multiplied Thursday in the world so that the CEI finally announces the name of the winner of the second tour between Laurent Gbagbo and the opposite Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp accounts for the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulous" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Ivoirian President's campaign, claimed that the intimidation of the electors practiced by the United Nations in the north of the country had dismissed the parties of the president who were out to vote.
All elections could be cancelled if the complaints made by Gbagbo were held by the Constitutional Council.
And Gbagbo's opposers believe that the highest core of the country is not neutral because it is guided by Paul Yao N'Dré, a nearly political covenant of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North, who devoted everything to the ex-rebells, felt "inacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he revoked the victory.
His alliances claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that he has brought a complaint before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral committee from spreading the results, it would be illegal.
The second turn of the presidential, Sunday, was to coordinate the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country remaining split in two years.
The United Nations had warned on Wednesday the Ivoire political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first tour on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from ancient President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first tour).
The rate of unemployment remained stable in France at the third quarter
The rate of unemployment in France in the meaning of the International Work Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolis (9.7% in counting outer sea departments) shows the corrected data of the provisional sea variations (CVS) which the Insee has made on Thursday.
The number of workers is 2.631 million in metropolis.
The second quarter data were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in metropole and 9.7% with DOMs.
In a year, the rate of unemployment is increased by 0.1 points.
Moreover, 3.4 million people in Metropolitan France did not work at the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not available in two weeks and whether they seek or not a job.
The situation of young people present on the work market has still decreased, with a new rate of unemployment, by 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 points on three months, +0.5 points on one year) and 25% including DOMs.
At the third quarter, 637 000 young people from 15 to 24 years were unemployed in the meaning of the BIT.
The elders have known for their part an increase in unemployment, 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 points in three months and one year), or 482.000 people of 50 or more years, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only 25-49 years have benefited from unemployment stability at the third quarter, 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 in three months, +0.1 in one year) and 8.8% in all France.
The Insee has no more monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a polymetic on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union Statistics Agency, continued to do it and announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini examined and placed in prison
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, manager of waste treatment companies and brother of PS president of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhone, was examined and replaced at the detention house of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence in the framework of an investigation on fraudulent public markets.
Alexandre Guérini has been reviewed for abuses of social goods, funds and public goods, receipt, active corruption, influence traffic and detention of municipalities, indicates his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is fighting and trys to explain about all the questions that the judge will ask him, not of fantasies."
"It's easily to follow it for a reprehensive leadership, it's another thing to prove them," he said to the AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, had to make a memo before his hearing to explain.
One of his neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined on Wednesday evening.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but to do the decharges he had to handle.
As regards the allocation of markets or the destination of funds related to their operation, he never knew it, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, the former Director-General of the Aubagne Aglomation Services, was reviewed on Wednesday for public funds and complications, and was released under judicial control with the prohibition of meeting the protagonists of the dossier.
"My client knew to make explanations to the facts who were reproached to him."
"The Instructor Court took account of it by not being free," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been reviewed and released in freedom on Wednesday evening, with judicial control for two of them, stated the adjudicating prosecutor of the Republic of Michael Raffin.
Michael Karabadjakian, director-General for the Purity of Marseille Provence Mettropole (MPM), is continued for "passive influence and corruption".
Two officials of the agglomation of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringier, are being examined for "subtraction and decline of public goods by a person charged by a public service mission", the other for "complied with public funds".
Finally, Alexander Guérini companion, Jeannie Peretti, was reviewed for "abusing social goods".
Among those who were confronted with Mr. Guérini figures Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently in a parallel case of fraudulent public markets touching Corse.
The investigators assume that his companies have served to whiteload the money of the large banditism.
The investigation is conducted in the framework of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 after anonymous courts, for frauds assumed in the public marketing, in particular in the waste branch.
In the nearby source of the investigation, research is particularly addressed to the conditions for the allocation and operation of a decharge of La Citotat, which collects the waste of Aubagne and some cities of the city of Marseille (MPM).
Affairs Clotilde Reiss: Elysée exagered mediation
Punctuation of more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the opinion in halene in France, made the diplomatic warning, and enhanced the detection of relations between Paris and Teheran.
All under the attention of the United States diplomates.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by the World reveal some under this crisis.
They describe how Elisea explained his strategy to the Americans, which is going to give them advice to the treatment of their own "otage" crisis in Iran (a small group of randonneries).
They show how the French responsibility tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French had not been contrary to the release of the freedom of Kauvand, a Iranian prisoner in France and searched by the American justice for the trafficking of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they place under a cruel light the way the French presidency tried to manipulate media to believe the idea that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, there was nothing.
A diplomatic telegraph edited on 12 to 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle otage cases".
The Council of Elysée for Strategic Affairs, François Richer, accompanied by the Director of the Quay d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is with the American diplomate Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They advise the Americans to do so much for rapating for their own citizens held in Iran.
"Does the sound," they say, "march in the media the words "human rights", "inocence", "inmediate release".
It is necessary to enhance the Iranian regime, sensible to its image.
"Do it as much as the Iranians ask you not to do."
'Cause, after the trials of discussions by discrete channels, 'the silence will rule nothing', the Iranians are 'masters in dilatators'.
Mr. Richier said that the arrest of foreigners is "a Iranian tactic: appeal for political changing".
It announces that Clotilde Reiss' freedom of prison (which will intervene on 16 to 16, on the day it repeats to the French ambassade) "needs the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros).
And he indicates that Elisee's anticipation of other otage crisiss, a phenomena that "will grew up."
The Iranians could "in a near future arrest one of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 to 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has come out of prison for twelve days, but remains locked in Iran.
An information is distributed: the Iranian ́id Kakavand, whose United States claims to extract for an illegal electronic material traffic sensitive to Iran, is released to Paris on a judge's decision.
The American ambassade, as many observers, is questioned about this cruel coincidence.
For Washington, who tracks the Iranian Clandestiness Networks for the Nuclear Programme, the extension of the Khakavand extension is a bad news.
Did France accept a trade?
Is Iranian freedom against France?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, Francois Richer ensures that this is not the case.
He said, not only "is completely surprised by the judge's decision," but tried to oppose it.
"There were living exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of the scales" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "The French Government cannot return to the decision," he noted.
Mr. Richer also wants to demonstrate that Kakavand remains under the "heavy" monitoring of French information services.
Elisee's adviser consists of a phone number, racroche, and then reports the American diplomate that Iranian is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian ambassador.
· the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elizabeth does not disturb its efforts by means of organized and "fuits" organized in the media to believe that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this non-ironic activity, and find that manipulation brings its fruits because several press articles affect the French official version.
A telegraph dated from 25 to 2009 refers to "The Media Blitz" of the French officers.
On the basis of such "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, the ambassade is asked in Paris.
"Despite their full declarations of praise, the French officers are in private that they have only a fair sense of what the people really did."
The document then refers to the reasons that Elysée had moved to pay in this figure.
The intense effort to communicate "will validate Sarkozy's opening policy", he analyzes.
A policy that was held in 2008, which "was then taken into account by many critical voices in France and foreigner, as a pre-mature and immortal vote".
By "reaching the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demonstrate the praise she can attach by playing a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to "see discouragement grains between Iran and Iran".
The American ambassador knows that of good source.
On the 11th, François Richer told him: "We don't know whether the people have done anything."
"But we thanked them at all."
"This should at least seem confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it to Elisea.
He thanks to the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and the Senegal for their "active role in the freedom of our partner".
No online games for young Korean last midnight
The South Korean Government will adopt a "Cendrillon" law that will prohibit adolescents to play online games after midnight by blocking their access, indicated government responsibility.
A draft law will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online games to block access to these games after midnight, younger than 16 years of age, mentioned representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Multium children play these games all night and then have difficulties to study at the oil and have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said the AFP Jo Rin, ministerial responsible for the draft law.
Online games will be accessible again at 6 hours in the morning.
The company will have a year to prepare for the application of the law.
The Government also intends to request companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents have requested it has been responsible.
It will also provide people who call for free software to limit the past time on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and journals regularly report different facts related to an intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the insufficient campaign of global competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea had received four gold medals in World Cyber Games, faced with 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: Fifa designs organising countries
In full, because of corruption suspects, the FIFA's ex-committee designs Thursday, 2018 and 2022, an extremely political choice in which influence and lobbying can take steps on the technical criteria.
One thing is safe, the edition 2018 of the Queen Competition of Fifa will take place in Europe, traditional basement of discipline (4 candidates: literature, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgica).
The 2022 International Federation will be much more exotic, hoped to win new territory (Qatar,日), after a first of the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implantation in the United States or in the East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that are part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar's emir, the leaders of Belgian and Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, ́yff) provides the measurement of the economic and political impacts of a world.
Thus, coulisse treatments may take up until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, the documents of the Spanish, the Portuguese (2018) and the American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be very difficult for the 22 members of the Ex-Committee at the vote.
The Sunday Times, on the basis of the revelations resulting in the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Themerii and Amos Adamu), could have destroyed the chances of his country, a football cup that accepted the World only once in 1966.
The BBC transmitted it a bed on Monday, spreading a documentary which is three major members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What do you miss the Fifa and put the responsibles in the embarrass, who have made it in an intense lobbying these last weeks with David Cameron in the first line.
The Government leader hopes to re-edition the success of his pre-deputy Tony Blair, who had received the Jo-2012 organization for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity provide for the EC blason of England?
Nothing is uncertain because the Due Spain-Portugal does not miss a lot with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its foot culture.
But the shadow economic and financial perspectives of both countries would be ambitional.
Possible repressions against Spain and Portugal and the doubts on the solvency only make the Russian share, become a weight overseer despite the lacunes of its document (states, hotels, transports).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutine decided not to move to Zurich and expressed a "loyal competition in the preparation of the vote" in a almost full allocation of the English presses against the members of the EC.
"When we cover them, we're trying to compromise them," Mr. Poutine launched.
For 2022, the United States, strong in 1994's experience, appear as logical favours.
The first world economic power, the seat of Fifa's main sponsors, the country . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
However, these new candidates appear to be preliminary for two countries with the test in 2002.
Another threat: the grant of the Mondial-2026 to China, which is bitterly desired by the Fifa, which would actually give the Asian chances for 2022.
With the Qatar, which had been the great game by proposing future stages, and Australia, the Fifa would continue its extension to new countries, but these two countries have more risks than certainty.
Australia, such as Japan and Korea, could also affect the weakness of television rights received by the European countries, the war nerve for Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle was really disappointed.
Mitterrand had believed that he was crazy.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the least hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is still less than they.
A mandate to Elisea calls another.
So the current head of the State will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not make good home with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So you have to do as if the doubt always exists.
In a sense like in the other.
In 2006, even without faith, Jacques Chirac's friends predicted that a third mandate was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "any part in the 2011 future".
Let him refer to UMP Parliamentaries, Tuesday evening in Elisea, the perspective of "two mandates" has sown a little feabrility.
Was that the official announcement of his candidature?
We were far away.
The President only reminded that the constitutional revision of 2008 had limited the number of five years to two.
He made a evidence, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he refers to the presidential, on the tonne of humor, at such meetings.
"The worst, or best, you still have it for seven years and half with me," he started them in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His previous statements do not make him more candidate than watch; they do not make it less.
If they raised comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the course to the candidate to the PS, on the one hand.
But this is not the input in Segolène Royal school that moves Nicolas Sarkozy to devote.
In contrast, because its candidate in 2012 is evident that many of the PS claims to be a war order in a previous order than planned.
Bad surveys, on the other hand.
For the first time, the right electors would prefer François Fillon's candidature to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion in the UDP above," the Prime Minister's surrounding immediately and suddenly reacted.
"If he believes that he is possible, he will not be candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
"He will always believe that he can win," Alain Juppee corrects, in evidence.
Euro: The ECB forced to maintain its purchases of State titles
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year had to be the opportunity to identify the procedures of crisis output or at least to announce a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that must be completed at the end of the year.
Sovereign debt crisis is obliged by the European Francfort Emission Institute, of course, will not be allowed to be likely to enhance a situation more stressed today on the European obligations markets.
The political cost would be much higher.
Ireland, at a press conference, the Minister for French Finances, Christine Lagarde, welcomed the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the Debts Crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say if she estimated that the central bank had to do more, for example, by increased its purchasing programme of sovereign obligations.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners... "
In Brussels, during its audience by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, had no longer shown his intentions, satisfied to indicate that the programme for purchase of state titles on the secondary market "super-sheet" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting of this Thursday.
Only certainty: The ECB will keep its main rate of the leader unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the obligation purchase by the ECB was doubled last week, approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And, increasing market operators, it would have made new Irish and Portuguese boughts yesterday.
In total, the euro central banks have bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, the advances of a purchase of purchases are no doubt (see page 29).
Economys don't even expect a significant change.
If loan operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsnale, this is still to unlimited liquidity allocations of generic conditions and for a week to three months.
The economists today expect this device to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that it is important to change its programme."
"If so, it would take the risk of provoking new short-term pressures," Michael Schubert, the economicist of Commerzbank, states.
"A progressive year outcome during the first quarter of 2011 appears more likely," advanced by Norbert Brams, economicist at Sal.
Uppenheim.
On the basis of its interventions on the debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to animate a atonic market," Norbert Brams.
In view of the importance of the exposures of European banks to the euro area's sustainable debt markets, the emission institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"He needs to be replaced by the lack of investors on the market and to do so to prevent the packaging of the most fragile income paid by the States," a significant mandatory manager yesterday.
Because if the interest rates are involving, the States will be increasingly gender to reduce their endlessness, otherwise to stabilize it.
The euro's safeguard is at this price.
In Italy, the Government of Berlusconi makes the back round
After a week starting anxiety for Italy, the situation was a little deteriorated yesterday with the reflux of the 10-year rate rate.
Return to the pre-calm.
On the outcome of a meeting with the Minister of Economics, the Presidents of the region said that Giulio Tremonti had heard qualifying the situation of "unencryptable" and waiting for a week-end of "pre-eye", which the interested person then denied.
Wednesday, the long German rate art reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of failure (CDS) was approximated to 263 points, leading to a certain deficiency in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the German rate art was greater than 400 base points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said "very concerned" by "the market turbulences" and by a possible counterparty from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economicist in the Hudson Institute.
The problem is, in particular, the lack of growth and the atonicity of tax income, which is going with the risk of the State to be able to cover its needs of funding.
The last previsions of Brussels have been a cold douche for the Government.
The Italian growth is currently expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the current budget is being reviewed at the Table Senate of 1.3% and 2% respectively.
In these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of the BDP in the next year (contrast with 3.9% of the Government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Whereas the voice of a new budgetary collection that could be placed after the feasts, for a amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new outstanding measures should be taken," considers the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, O日 Rehn.
For this time, Italy receives support for international institutions.
"The economy is in order and its accounts are good, we have repeated it for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund for Italy's FMI.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short or long-term, because despite its important debt (119.2% of the PIB in 2011, NDLR), the efforts requested in Italy are less than those requested to other countries," said Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Economy.
The issue of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censure motion to the House of Members, following which preliminary elections could be organized by the end of March.
It would then be opened a little time for decision-making in case of serious crisis.
Europeans reflect the strengthening of anticrisis devices
Christine Lagarde still tortured him in a press conference in Paris yesterday: "The Europeans, I think it was still shown on Sunday and night, are obviously solid, determined, committed to defend their currency and their monetary area."
Although any related, the detention recorded yesterday on the rate of European State obligations has brought water to the governments and the ECB.
But we can't talk about a start of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's notation agency announced that it could decrease Portugal's debt, the most speculated target today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clearness and political visibility, particularly on the systems," said the Economys of Exane BNP Paris.
More than "the political time is much slower than the market's time".
Conscious of this heat and its dangers, the European countries intensify discussions to strengthen existing anticrisis devices.
Official consultations between the most directly concerned Ministers of Finance and, more widely, with their partners of G20 are a good train.
And this is also the European Group and the Ecofin meetings from the beginning of the next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
In the menu, the outcome of non-conventional support measures to the euro area countries in the market stimulator (see above).
As regards the European Financial Stability Fund (FESF), its ex-director, Klaus Regling, started Tuesday in Singapore a Asian tour to inform extreme-east investors of the crisis development in Europe.
If the goal of these visits is not to raise funds, it will certainly prepare it.
The first emissions of the FESF shall be provided in the next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative granted the Agency Re replied that the United States would support a possible increase in the funds mobilised by an additional direct commitment of the FMI.
The countries in the first line, Portugal and Spain are willing to adopt reforms, in particular in the organization of the work market.
Reforms which are too closer to extreme efficiency measures.
Lisboa and Madrid want to take a different way from those in Greece and Ireland.
One and another takes any price to avoid seeking international assistance before establishing their own budgetary correctives and decideing necessary reforms to refund strong confidence.
Finally, European funds are subject to the options available to accelerate the standardization process of the markets of sustainable obligations.
By transition to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first advanced idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not wish to return the hand to the portfolio.
The economys of Barclays Capital, an actor of all the first plan of the European debt market, believe that an average of approximately 100 billion euros would provide "preference" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism today of 60 billion euros.
A Council that has all the opportunities to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions would be imprisoned.
Snow and snow: 24 departments in oral survey
Snow episodes are still caused by difficulties of employment, especially on the secondary network in Bretagne, and some economic activities are dangerous.
Twenty-four departments are now in oral surveillance due to the risk of snow and snow.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Two-Serves and Vienna, have already been held at 20 departments in an oral survey, 18 since Thursday afternoon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to France, supported snow abbreviations affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and low snow on the Iceland of France.
Snow beds from 2 to 5 cm, pointly from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, even to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charent, Charente-Maritime, Côtes of Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Basse-Normandia, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Negatival episodes are quite significant to cause difficulties of employment and to disturb certain economic activities, predicts weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were prohibited to weight more than 7.5 tonnes, including Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Bria-Loudeac axes.
The secondary networking in Bretagne is very difficult for the gendarms that recommend to take its vehicle only in the case of need and the delay of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transports were prohibited for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measures were intended on Wednesday evening to limit the weighting.
The prefecture "invites all cars to the greatest idea on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested aircraft companies on Thursday 25% of their flights on the Paris Airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the future snow falls.
The DGAC recommends air passengers to contact their company.
In Great Britain, the Gatwick airport, south of London, and the Edimbourg, in Ecosse, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial trials
Since the debate about the modernization of transports in Ile-de-France has hit its full, billions are weeping.
At least in the discussion.
In particular, 23 billion are called for the Grand Paris Metro to build the Grand Paris Society.
In order to start this SGP, the State announced a capital contribution of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this sum will then allow SGP to enter into the markets a part of the financing of its double bucle.
Today, we finally reach the first additions.
The 2010 Corrective Finance Act, examined in the Committee on the Finance of the National Assembly this morning, contains the instruments intended to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, in the text of the draft law, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment of the Great Paris Society".
It is encrypted: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
The second is a reorientation of a tax on offices already existing "to modernise it, to increase the product and to affect this increase in the Grand Paris Society".
How much would that report?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from 4 billion.
"The tax resources are 4 billion euros of the capital funding which will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Grand Paris Society in the middle and measure of the project," can be read in the statement of motives.
At the SGP, we don't find this shocking system.
"From the time it is created income (the two taxes, ndlr), you can cover studies for three years and then tap in the 4 billion after, it is explained."
"This will be inscribed in the budget and cast into the steel and measurement."
The SGP considers that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4 billion promised are still to absent abonnements, may cause a little aggressive parliamentary discussion.
First meeting was on 7 December.
Hackers winners and spices in love
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it appears a scandal, a scandal that appears as scandal only before hypocrisy that regulates the relations between the States, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes at international level, and prefigures a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each document consists of a secret service (of any nation or national) is composed of press coupures.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what was possible for months to read in any journal (except those who are owner of Berlusconi) and Khadafi's carcatural disturbance profile has been long-term for scan cabaret artists.
The rule that secret dossiers should be composed only for news already known is essential to the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to historical publications, you will see that each book repeat (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templers or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous books.
And this is not only because the author of hidden texts doesn't like to do inherited research (not know where to search for news about the inoxidant), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know, and who reconfigure what they have learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same for secret dossiers.
The informator is persuasive and persuasive (or limited) the head of secret services (if it may be, I know, the editor in Liberation), which does not feel as true that he recognises.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the American ambassador of Rome sent to the State Department was the same as those Newsweek had previous week.
So why did the records of these dossiers make so sound?
On the one hand, they say that everyone cultivated already knows that the ambassadors, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of the State can call or take a plane to meet dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and have, except a few small representative exercises, become a campaign center.
Any investigation film viewer knows that very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that we do like to ignore it.
However, the fact of repeating it strictly violates the responsibility of hypocrisy, and it serves to place the American diplomacy under a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country brings an unnecessary struggle to the department of State.
So the scandal does not make the victims as much as the "bournals".
But let us come to the deep nature of what happened.
So, at Orwell's time, we could design all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy was completely present since, when every movement could be controlled through the phone, each transaction, the visited hotel, the rented holiday and then the citizen became the total victim of the power's eyes.
But when it is shown, as it happens now, that even the encryptions of power secrets can not escape from a hacker control, the control report stops to be undirectional and become aware.
The power of control of each citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the winner of the citizen - can know all the secrets of the power.
How can a power that has no longer the possibility to keep his own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel said it already, that a true secret is a empty secret (and a empty secret will never be revealed); it is also true, that all knowing the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a empty secret, because it relates to the public area; but reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove all power.
WikiLeaks did not wrong Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big in Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury affected by a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will no longer be able to online any booked information - it would return to a show on the road corner.
But it is also evident that with the current terms, it is unexpected to be able to maintain confidential reports by phone.
Nothing more easier than discovering if and when a State leader moved to a plane and contacted one of his own.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know that, in the meantime, my prevision is referring to science-fiction and is therefore Roman, but I have to imagine government agents who move discretely in diligences to uncontrolled travellers, being portors only from heartly learned messages or, at all, hiding the rare information written in a chaussure.
The information will be kept in a single copy in key-closed shots: at the bottom, the Watergate spending attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the progress is now in crab, that is, to recompense.
A century after the telegraph has revolutioned the communications, the Internet has rebuilt a telegraph on sons (phones).
Video cassettes (analogic) had allowed researchers to explore a step film by going forward and back and covering all the secrets of the mount, while CDs (numbers) now allowed only to run from chapter in chapter, namely by macroportions.
With high speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in the plane, and the movements he includes, we need three and half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the policy and communication techniques return to horse cars.
A last observation.
At the time, the press tried to understand what was happening in the secret of the ambassadors.
It is now the ambassadors who require confidential press information.
Climate: how France wid’s promises of funding
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the compliance with the promises of quickly deblocated finance (these fast start or previous finance) carried out by developed countries.
And the big French woods are reveled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries engaged in providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union promised 7.2 billion euros per three years and France 1.26 billion euros (420 million per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU went out the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment on fast-start finance: a report on detailing the action of its Member States, with press-reference, large event, brochure distribution...
Transparency operation is appreciable and appreciated to its right value: developing countries and civil society would like to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that in 2010, it was 2.5 billion euros, which put it on the right path to respect its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when we look in the detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort is made without the deterioration of the development Aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means "new and additional".
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose procedure has been blocked by France.
Today, everyone chooses the best reference to him.
For example, the European Commission considered as a reference in 2009: international funds are maintained, and it is 150 million per three years under the early start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of a year or in terms of development aid level.
In contrast, France considers that the funding of "all new projects" for 2010 is "new and additional".
Otherwise, there is no reference to the expenditure of the years or at the global level of development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even reduce), which requires to respect its commitment to "new and additional funding"...
Another important element, the distribution of gifts and loans.
There still is no rule and each chooses its calculation mode.
Some, such as France, believe that a loan of 1€ is 1€ given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain rentable investments (including projects relating to the reduction of emissions based on more efficient amounts), it is impossible to present an euro that will be recovered as equivalent to an euro given... In addition, it should be calculated in accordance with its commitments only the cost of the loan for the beneficiary country (equivalent to an interest rate).
But France has only a reason: she "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to verify itself.
It is the only country of the Union to use so much the loan.
Germany recalls 46%, while Denmark, Netherlands or Slovakia (in other cases) respects their commitments with 100% of gifts.
In other words, when the large majority of the European Union makes 1 euro to satisfy its commitment, France only makes 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Great pass-tower!
In the summary, in its early financing, France works a double crochet: on one side on the development of the action in time and on the reality of the financial effort.
Only 36.1 million euros, she believes that it costs 420 million "new and additional" in accordance with its promises.
The maintenance of the Ministry of Finance (for it is Bercy who has made the arbitrage) could have a double negative impact at the same time within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give it if it is enough to spend?) and in the negotiations because the developing countries are not completely duplicated...
The chapter of the previous financing is only a small question of relatively short-term, in relation to climate discussions.
But it could be a more sand grain in the large machine that is UNFCCC.
Let's hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of previous funding.
On the other hand, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other European Union countries.
In particular, France could make the debates on long-term funding benefits (another crucial chapter currently discussed): the question of "additionality" or the mode of accounting of loans will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become progressive on these injuries as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Ministry of Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, which will come to Cancun next week.
A surprised announcement on the fast start of France and its view of "additionality" and the use of loans would be of nature to increase the international confidence level necessary to progress in discussions.
Warning on children's pesticides
A 10-year-old child incomes on a day of 81 different chemical substances, a study of this Thursday of the future Generations (ex- Movement for Rights and Compliance with the future generations).
Its results are "not significant statistical values in view of the low number of samples analysed but are illustrative of the problem treated," buyed between July and September foods usually consumed in four foods and a decade on one day by a child of a decade of years, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These types of food, including official recommendations - five fruit and fresh fruits, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as fridge, were examined by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The asylum balance is accommodated: 81 chemical substances with 42 possible canceric substances or five classified cancer substances and 37 substances that may be acting as endocrinian contaminants (PE), studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in almost all of the cases, the limits for each individually used chemical substance are not exceeded, our investigation is well seen that the reality of consumers' exposure to potentially cancer and/or anxious contaminants is concerned," notes the report.
For the breakfast, the bear and the milk tea contains only more than one of possible cancer residues and three hadered as cancers, as well as nearly twenty residues possible to disturb the hormonal system.
The pome, imported from Brazil, as set out in the study, provides traces of six chemical substances which, however, a fongicide prohibited in France.
Even a thing for Kenya's Green Haricots, including the breakfast, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide prohibited in the EU.
Moreover, the hacked steak, the tone in box, and even the bread bathroom and the chewing gum were trupped of pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the robet water analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examen of plastic asylum used to cook the food to the micro-wave was not free.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminant cocktail" is probably under-estimated," the study.
The European Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), on its side, proposed "the emergency of the situation" to establish a moratory on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the civilization diseases".
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) showed the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the consumed fruits and fruits in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
