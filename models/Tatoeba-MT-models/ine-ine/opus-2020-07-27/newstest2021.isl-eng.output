Called to the World
Marketing forces Looks Like You Need Iceland seem to have gone well and cry out and out of nature are going to take people white and wide around the world.
"You have the complaint, I need Iceland," says a woman outside the big world in review with an announcement from the market military approach Looks Like You Need Iceland on the YouTube materials.
Any exciting claims will keep Iceland in their heart forever and for the young woman’s sake is to come as the first time to the end of Iceland.
However, in the United States, she is in all disasters, making it advice to wait for a few months.
Another looking questions whether the road to Island is able, for no aircraft is.
The story doesn't mean if he comes from a timetable.
The Egill Thordersson of the Peel Statement Agency, which has made the reports with the International Publication Agency M&C Saatchi, states that the reports have been expected.
"I came to many Inspired By Iceland-arms that have gone very well but this new military trip is already going to kill.
In the basic way, this turns to a PR-value, it's getting foreign media to run over the army, and it's been uncertainly good.
In a relatively short time, we have been replaced by about six hundred films throughout the world that at all reach a number of two billion.
The valuation of these refunds is based on 1.8 billion crons.
It's not funny."
The main market of all the United States is equal and the military has been very well walking there, although the Americans are not going to the country in the west.
In Egil’s statement, the market areas such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have taken care of themselves, such as Russia, which is quite overwhelming.
There were reactions from future areas, such as India, which were not specially raised.
“ These statements have been more likely than we are living, ” says Egill, “but this may have been more than four million people who have seen the subject on YouTube.
"We couldn't want a better start."
The pictures on the opening took the Year of Seaberg, the photographer of the morning magazine, with the statements on the heading "Let It Out" in the middle of the last month.
The treasures appeared white and wide, such as in the School Warning League in Reykjavik, in Reynisfura, in Schogarfoss, in the Sollheima Chamber, and in the coast of the Hairleif heads.

In the class, we took Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
Twelve of the island’s reports were made, but at the same time, in the southern country, another group of the Western and Westquarters.
As Egils said, "Let It Out" is only the first person in the Looks Like You Need Iceland military, but it is intended to have a winter attack in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is only the first stage in this work for the island room," says Egill, adding that the cooperation with M&C Saatchi has worked very well.
“ It is great to work with them.
In such works, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the borders with which we are talking."

Then she placed e* in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch and Melissu Joan Hart, A night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.

At the time I read the manuscript I knew who this person was," said Donovan about her game in Clueless.
Couldn't leave policies after night trace
About fifty issues came to the board of police in the capital area today, and in the Police Journal, the cases have been changed.
The day of the Police on the Fisheries began by the police to have dismissed a man who had recently been released from the prisoner after living in the case of a divorce.
The man did not want to go away after he was released and did not obey the police orders that told him to go.
The man has seen a fascinating trial on the police because of his progress.
Then a man was arrested in Copavogi at the morning.
The police had been able to exchange two men in Bretholt because of an announcement of body attack.
Then a woman who was sitting at a business center in Copavoga could not be able to build for the account at the end and was therefore called to the police.
It was announced tomorrow in the midst of prayers.
An elder whiteman, Renault's missionary, looked at her for a time, and she was taking a free hand.
The car is not found.
The Blessing of the Gloria - The Hazard of the Lights
That learning has reached a flight on the Internet that the flow of rest over the part of the Gladway, but the Naya Rivera played in California on the day, and there has been the third majority of the participants to make life long ago.
The pictures of the joy road (e.g. Glee) are favorable parts of song, dance and joy.
The spectators followed the so - called joyfulness of young people in schools, their love, and their devotion.
It was not always taken out with the severe joyfulness, but in the mouth of singing and dancing, the person of the participants can overcome any of the circumstances that arose in their lives.
Yet, outside the hall, great troubles have caused the players and staff of the participants so much that teachings have wake up to blowing the rest of the parts.
Naya Marie Rivera took the role of Santán Lopez in the participants, a cluster who didn't call all her mother.
After the party had run, Rivera went to have the player Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child Josey with him.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence and put them in the midst.
Although Dorsey refused to deal with the love of the householder’s violence, the problem was falling down.
On July 8, it was announced that Rivera was missing after its five - year son was found alone on a boat on the water of Lake Piru in California.
The boy was sleeping in a board in the ship, and he was able to understand the police offices that he and his mother had been thrown up and so Rivera would have brought him back to the ship but never seemed to be there.
There was a high target search for Rivera.
The day after the search of the police officer began to discern the area since we were looked out since Rivera had been drunk.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was publicly determined.
It is deemed that it has seemed to have a lot of fluid in the water, and the last needs to save the sons.
Dancing causes were recorded in the drinks of anxieties.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith went with the role of Finn Hudson in the parts, the American footballman with the angels who made the key factors to promote the joyful and respectful way.
No parts, however, Moneith was flipped with a personal dull.
Since 13 years of age, he had been stuck with fibres and tried to get out of her.
In 2013, his collaborators were able to participate enough, to get into and encourage him to look forward.
Moneith met them and seemed to look at a better way.
Only two months after he had finished the meeting, Moneith was found in the hotel room after he had come out to enjoy his friends.
The banama was a mixture of wine and alcohol.
It wasn't considered to talk about voluntary work.
Moneith had been engaged and his endurance for the wine was so decreased that the dose that he had previously suffered well, experienced tolerance.
He was only 31 years old when he left his life.
His destiny was heavy to his fellow workers, but, under the basis of his opposite wife, Lea Michele, was determined to keep taking parts before and dedicated them to a whole part of Moneith’s memory and his personality of Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling went with the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the parts, Puck was a American footballman, like Finn, and had a little respect for his fellows in the Glorious Testament, or so that he was able to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on the warning of a child’s clothing.
In his home home, there was a great quantity of children’s clothes, and soon the question was openly questioned.
It was evident that Salling was ready to be.
He was determined and responsible for his breach.
He had been over his head to six years of prison -- what he was coming to do with a record of sexual offenders and looking for a close relationship with childhood.
Before the judge had decided the punishment, Salling, who was then free of security, was drawn close to his home.
Dancing cause was self-sufficient.
It wasn't just players of the players that had fallen from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant leader of the participants.
In 2013, only 41 years of age, he was injured.
With the poison, a woman named Nancy Motes worked.
She was the younger sister of Julia Roberts’ big star, and she did not take her sister a fine story, but she told Robert's great government and unexpected progress.
Motes took his own life in 2014, but she felt a serious weakness.
She left a letter to her neighbor, where she gave her mother and her sister a responsibility.
"My mother and my sisters have nothing to do with me, except the remembrance that it was those who were my worst weakness."
Lea Michel was the stars of the participants.
Recently, she has been emphasised to enhance her companions with a single and transition to a place of grips and to have excessive stars.
Jesse Luken took a job in the participants in 2012.
In 2019, he was arrested and stuck for the battle.
The Heather Morris played a great role in the shares.
In 2010, she became aware that the unfruited computer trials came into neck images from her and showed it on the Internet.
The players of Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner put them in both parts and have been in love.
Later, it was noted that Jenner used her violence in the relationship.
It can put flowers on almost everything
It increases the growth of children when they get to play out of the garden with their parents to flow and to get to grow up and to grow.
It is infinitely possible to do with flowers as indicated by the Spanish photographer Kubel.
Only having time with children in the garden is something that never forgets.
They will remember the flowers, the flames, and, of course, the precious time they took with their parents.
Buy a boat after the tenth round
"I don't think we're a lot of mariners we're at the country's play school," says Axel Örn Godmunds son, who's on the beaches on the summer, but we're a psychiatric at the University of Iceland over the winter."
Strandways are very pleasant when you are studying.
If you make good fish, you can have good uses, and I feel that it is fine to leave it because you are taking a school.
The designs also make me good in the winter," says Axel Örn Godmunds son, 25-year psychological, who are in some ways of beach like some of the last.
Axel was the latest to be stuck on the base when a journalist came to talk to him later at the beginning of the week."
“ The knowledge I was in the decade, I took the headquarters for ships under 12 meters long and bought my ship the summer after I finished the basic school.
I've spent strangers on my boat some later.
I bought the ship used by my knowledge, Hartman the son of Jonah, and I called the ship his name.
Hartmann was grown up when I purchased the ship and stopped being at sea and he was very sad when he saw that the ship was his name.
Hartmann left a few years after I took the boat," Axel adds that he has bought the boat for three million.
“ I agreed with Hartmann to pay the half, one and half million, at the beginning of summer and the half at the end of the summer when I was ready to run.
So I had the ship in debt at the end of this first of my summer on him."
How, though, could a boy have one and a half million to pay for a boat when he had a new school?
“ I was just giving up and collecting money, I had been working with my dad to sea when I was a boy, I was some driving with him, and I got my part.
I also put my money in my boat."
Axel is born on Isaford, where all his mothers are, but he has lived in Copavoga since he was a boy.
“ I can go here in the west area because I have a legal home at my grandmother in Issafird.
I learned in this area in the west of roads with Daddy.
I will bring myself into the midst of the fourth, after my feelings: for this field is near to all the west.
Though I feel better western, I have also provided the Snowshore and the west.
I have also provided for the sun but the most grass," says Axel, who always runs one firemaster in the morning and sometimes speaks with the mosques and sing for the sky, in a single time outside the balloon.
“The network outside of the sea is good, so I can call, listen to the hardware and music.
I don't think I'm alone on the boat.
Of course, I'm trying to avoid moving in the hair, but, of course, sometimes something has been more weather, but never a big risk," says Axel, who is lucky to have never been marine.
He says the length of the working day follows how the winds walk each time.
"In the beach, I'm never more than 14 hours in a single way, but I've also been running in some systems, for example in the woods, but then I've been along with one and half sunrise outside the sea."
The front community in the beaches says that he can take 770 kilos a day that he feels a land.
"There are the rest that I can't take on the Fridays, on Sundays, and on Sundays, and I can only take twelve days in the month, these four months, which the strangers stand over, in May, June, July, and August.
In my death, the sea should choose their holidays after weather and nothing.
This unnecessary pressure is on humans to rest instead of having 48 days over all the summer and to choose their heads.
So the area shipping may also go for me, and the sea space that is well placed with fishing should enjoy it," says Axel, which brings the most tissue from the sales of the sea on its beachways, but also the only up and other species quickly.
Axel works over a winter time with high school school at Nupi Game School in Copavogi.
"I don't think we're a lot of mariners we're playing at the country's play schools," Axel's proud and adds that he's just intended to work timely at the game school.
“ I’m determined because I feel this awesome job.
I hope that my psychology is using me at the game school in the future," says Axel, who has long been studying in business.
An error occurred while trying to log in
An error in the records that people fill when it comes to the country in order that a person living here in the country was not revoked in a view.
The file of teaching is not required if the following is completed in English, such as when it is done in Iceland.
“ This will be considered in the week, ” says a specialist in the land’s land’s landscape.
Three internal areas were based on the vital part of the country’s hospital.
On July 15, one of those who experienced appreciation came to the country, two days after the rules of such a so - called homecome.
Those who lived in Iceland are then moved to the land and returned to the four - to - five - days later.
However, at midnight’s news, ROUV reported that the appropriate would have followed the old system.
The view of the border was no sensation and it was not called back to the virus.
Camula Rut Sigfous daughter, a specialist in the country’s landscape, says in convergence with the newspaper that this may be an error in the reporting report.
Including the English recording list, it is not required to put a teaching in the same way as in the Icelandic version.
Even so, it has been thought first for foreign travelers.
Therefore, it has not been automatically invited to come in a show.
Although they have completed the entry format in English, the workers have also been watched to send people back in a show after it comes to the country.
"This will be considered in the week how it can easily facilitate people's accessibility to wake up their attention on the course."
The man is alone, and six have been placed in a battle.
They all go to a show, but two of us went to show signs.
The mixture is currently in progress with the three incidences that have been detected in ́s, but it is mostly completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the islandic specification has shown that there is a decline from the coronary disorder that has not been found here before.
In the case of the rebellion, Israel was aware that the one who moved the virus to the country had an approach to the other European people.
Camella says that it should be the way the virus would come before tomorrow.
Everything is now 15 in a single way together with the web COVID. is.
135 are in battle.
Move of five missing offline
Five internal enterprises have been known here in the last days of the country.
Of them, the entirely unconnected, is not possible to find the origin of the infection arising on the Rey Cup itrotamoth.
The mixture is still significant.
We were originally sent to the third, especially to the battle, but they were decreased to sixteen.
In the general, 34 are in a disaster because of these new interactions.
At the second time, it has raised questions about whether such events are not taken into account.
John K. John’s son, a community leader of the public government, says that it is possible, as long as people do not adopt and regulate.
“ We are constantly disappointing for all who live here that it is to maintain a private disease.
We also feel that people who are keeping events are certain rules in line with which they need to follow.
Then it is possible to keep events, ” says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by keeping the air of individual diseases.
Rules and regulations are also in constant review.
“ What is needed to do, and what the general poverty and the country’s population are continuing to disturb people is to think of these individual diseases.
At the same time, both home and even in the service company.
That people are weakening their hands and useing sprays.
It prevents the smit to go forward, ” says John.
"We strive to keep people in the good way that we were, so that we may be able to keep on the results that we have come to grace."
40% of the victim lab COVID-19 with diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard the phone of her father’s difficulty to get the spirit.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical assistance.
On the next day, he was lost.
The disorder was caused to discontinue respiratory disorders because of coronary infections.
A diabetes was described in the Death Testimony Court as a subsequent problem, and Brumfield, who is with a diabetes, was threatened that it was not to come.
The Rey of the newspaper says that the fear of Brumfield doesn't have any reason.
Renew studies made by the United States authorities show that the level of 40% of those who have been placed with diabetes 2 as a subsequent response.
When the percentage of those who have not reached 65 years of age is considered, the percentage is increased in half.
The study of the United States Seeds (CDC) took up more than 10,000 people in 15 Riches from the coronary in the period of February and in May.
Jonathan Wortham, a CDC infectious expert, says that the conclusions are vulnerable, not the last thing for those who seem to have diabetes 2 and their friends.
In a high growth of Reʹs, the responses from the 12 states that responded to comparative proportions were highlighted.
10 . But among them are California, Arifata and Coiya, yet have not been informed of the subsequent sentences.
“The illness was already increasing.
Now COVID—19 has been broken in the way as a powerful century," Reʹs has said after Elbert Huang, leader Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the Chicago School.
The diabetes are more common among black and people of South America origin, which has been worse from the coronation.
One of the best protection for those with diabetes 2 is to maintain a disorder in carcinogenic, loyal food and health care groups.
However, the coronary degree has made many difficult for a week to keep the rutine.
Insulin has then been administered by a lot to continue to meet in the work and to cease to be exhausted for the virus.
Really, the American authorities may have been conscious of the risk that those with diabetes 2 are signed by virus.
When the SARS coronavian passed over in 2003, it was about 20% of them with the opinion and in 2009, in the age of Sweden, these groups were three times more risked to be involved in the SHR.
When MERS did so in 2012, an investigation showed that 60% of those who had been placed on our diabetes.
Charles S. Dela’z, scientist of Yale University, says that because of the effect of the COVID-19 virus, the way has been dismissed by an unknown accident.
"I'm afraid we'll see a fluid of problems when this is done," Andrew Bolton says international sugar conferences.
Physicians have warned that the coronary disorder knows with an unusual way of leading to hypotensions related to diabetes, such as renal and renal divergence.
Similarly, new studies in order to lead to consequences of diabetes.
In fact, scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the coronary and diabetes 2.
In many patients with diabetes, the virus is discussed with heart, lungs and renal substances.
Then a high concentration of glucose and lipid in sugar may be called a true “storm of female news”, as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and speaks to the body.
Insufficient incidence plants may lead to a ≥2% that may cause a fluid blood disorder.
"This is all a big puzzle," Dela ́z says.
"This is connected to all the investment."
The message has been corrected.
"Where the campaign was invited, they went out of the room."
Astron Magnus daughters and Atli Bollason’s wife became the unusual bond of Ragnari Khartan’s son’s artists to sexualize a camera for the work that the lister was putting up in Paris.
"We loved one another, so this wasn't flying."
Thus, Athli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and his mother, the Grand daughter of Assur, for the first time.
“ I was very healed by her.
It was naturally only the exhaustity, but it was a very unhearted thing to me.
And I'm still sorry," he says.
This is also the beginning of the first man to be found regularly.
“ I always hear this story.
"The last week," she says, "which also took the husbands in the first time.
“I felt and felt such a big acetic in the Atla round that I file.
There's a lot of time and a lot of happening, and I was healing it."
Atley says that they have focused on it in their own ways.
“ We don’t put our bags on the same shoes and assemblies.
We're avoiding the rutine that we're seeing around."
It is possible that they have taken the problem from Ragnari Khartan’s son, the film lister, just pleasing, although it would be most important.
"Christin's common friend has contact with us and asks whether we can eat desert with us, Ragga and Ingibörg, Ragnar's wife, on Snaps."
They were invited, met the three rows of Snaps, and they took a desert wine, and once a second.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them into their headquarters on the pictures viewed in Palais de Tokyo, Paris.
“He had many videoworks called Scenes from Western culture.
He simply described it."
Assuron says that he has described the work as a banal and decade from the lives of the Western camp.
"He was with a knife of all the scenes that he wanted to take, and finally he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating."
Ragnar’s late requested the couple to participate in showing young milliseconds to love in a minimum room.
“ These are coincidence with the beginning and end, ” says Atli.
Ragnar’s parents did not know much, even though they knew about him, and he was of them “when they knew us and felt that we were able to do this.
They had words that they did not want to tell people.
Maybe they thought that they would not get the right people but people who would get sexually disappointed from performing for others."
They encouraged Ragnar and agreed to think about this, but it did not take long time.
“ When we vowed from Snaps, we said, ‘ Are we not just in this?
It was just that.
I trust Ragnari as the lister and his team, "Astron and Atli are submitting.
"This is about love and neighbor"
Senan was taken into a good apartment in the Myrar Garden.
There was a very devastated moviesthematics; a master, Ragnar, and a soundman, and a couple.
After the kitchen had been on the station, all of them left the room to wait outside the car except Atli and Astron.
“ We did not just decide how to be.
We received some advice, but we tried to forget time and place.
Be unconscious about what we are doing and for each of us.
It was nothing played, we just loved one another so it wasn't flighted," Astron said.
But was that romantic?
"Yes, this was a little romantic," Atli and Astron agreed.
“ We were invited to the campaign before they went out of the room.
"It was a little like being free of a fine hotel in Paris."
The team was injured by the couple’s view of the work that moved them.
"When Tommy was looking at this, he wept, although this was so beautiful," says Atli.
“ This is so much about love and neighbor and self - association, ” says Astron.
Parents have seen the work, and Atli says that his mother has heard the road of the sons of the Reykjavic List, and then realized that he was part of the work.
“ Then she turns her back and goes to stick in it, ” says Atley.
“Mama and dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone this so, but so only Dad sends me a message and says, "Good to rejoice in a small family in Palais de Tokyo," Astron says.
And would the involvement of the work have been deeply connected with the Assyrians and Atla?
“We are still all together so maybe this was something deep.
"Astron and clothe my close relationship with the family," says Astron.
So Astron saw the work in the Kaupmantown with his colleague.
"I felt a little difficult not to be with you, but with someone," she says, "and she turns to her husbands.
"But it was a pleasure to see this because this is just one old one in a great greater work, and when you see this with the other works, this is very mixed.
I could get something out of this, and I was just proud.
And there the small bath in my magic was on me, "Astron, who was anxious of the unmarried children of the marriage when the old was taken up.
"This was just beautiful."
○ Marsibil ́usen talked to them in Asia and Atla in the Love Stories of Ras 1.

Sending free for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, an American missionary in Iceland, in the light of the media after the CBS realized tomorrow that he wanted a weapons of life where he was afraid of his life.
However, it has not been unrequired for the presidents of the United States to order a missionary here in the country.
Since Carol Van Primst was sent by the missionary of the United States in April 2009, he has been unexpected in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Priest was aware of special circumstances, but Castlow realized from 2009 that she had to receive the False Word.
On a quarter meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a call from the presidential office of the material that it would not be wronged.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she learned international communication with Army War College.
Sexteen months later, Van Prist was at work in September 2010.
Sometimes, Robert S. Connan was commanded as a missionary.
At the work, Loius Ariega had finally worked in the foreign service for a year - old service.
So he left the headquarters of 2013 and took a missionary officer in Guatemala.
Then another unexpected missionary time took place.
In January 2015, Robert Barber agreed to the United States Service and worked sooner, but there had been no missionaries at the place for 13 months.
Barber was a political commander but not a diplomate, but he had worked as a lawyer and a short choice of Barack Obama.
He left the way and Donald Trump took the Chairman's office on 20 January 2017, as the custom is with a political commanded missionary.
The Government of Trump was unusual to order both missionaries and the way of setting an ambassadors in Washington.
Thus, two years ago until the United States of America, Jeffrey Ross Gunter invited his meeting to ask him about the travelers and confirmed the end of the missionary in Iceland.
In his testimony on the tiny said he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who was laid, had been broken by the netherlands' mountain.
Gunter is a political organization, a previous skin in California, and has been manifested in general in the Republic of the Jewish Coalition of the Jewish Republic.
Sheldon Adelson, the player, created them in general, but Adelson is a great supporter of Donalds Trump.
Gunter worked in Iceland in May 2019, but then no missionaries had been in the country since the latest 2017, for two and four months, which is the longest example of the land.
The reason is both how long Trump's Government was to designate people in a key extension as well as the last year, the United States work has been very dealing with a long time, including the confirmation of the missionary officer.
Since 2009, it has been summarized unexpectedly in Iceland for more than five years.
However, it has not been prevented by the missionary ways that had recently been opened with the angelic.
The projects are estimated to have costed approximately 6.5 billion, but the safe walls will enlarge the building and the shot glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current missionary security teacher because he is told to fear his life and wanted to get armed lifeguards.
Earlier IBV player became a racist in Iceland - "The mistakes were to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejeje, former IBV player, said that he had become racism when he was in Iceland and that he was looking after having come to the country.
Reviews with Tonny shown in the Ukrainian Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently attended the Uganda Police FC playing at Uganda.
In the conversation with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about a lot, including a second time here in the country, but he played with IBV, Val and Iceland.
“ When I arrived to Iceland, I did not play in the middle as I used to play.
The first of the deputy was in that position, but he was also with the trust number I wanted so I received no of what I wanted," says Tonny, but he played on the right side of the game with IBV.
Without what Tonny talks, it is the racist that he had been in Island.
He says this is a problem that many black players will face when they play in Europe.
“ This came to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I met the matter and asked my friend about what it was.
He told me that my opposite had made a Russian statement fall about me after I took him."
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norge, where he went to Haugesund.
There he says that he has committed the mistakes that he has seen.
Tonny was not able to come to Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to come to the country.
Then he asked to return to Iceland on the salary, but he went to Val.
“ It was a mistake to return to Iceland.
I think if I had been longer in Norway, I would have received the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would probably be more.
He wants to mean that the crowd to Island has made his dream to come to the Great Country of Europe.
Find me in a woman's heart
The doctors of St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3,8 miles long black hot in a high-scale woman who looked there.
The doctor was able to drag the orm with a teeth.
The study showed that there was a discussion of the snow animal.

Spain is now in burning relations with anxieties about another European coronary division, but there governments have taken action to renew the extent of the coronary age.
In Catalonia, all the entertainment life has been placed on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where we are invading.
Other Europeans have even been taken to act because of persecution in Spain, but in Britain, everyone has been warned of travelling to Spain at the home of Spain, as well as in Norway, and the French have been warned about travelling to Spain.
It is important to renew in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find equivalent to the spread of the virus and recovery of the economy.

The Mosaic Act finally benefits
Before the Toll House in Reykjavik, it's a big and deep hole.
Below there are men with an appelsinguille asylum.
There's a big grave.
And many of my job machines.
Can't be closed for the interview.
However, it is possible and there many now steal and respect the list of millions of mosaics — like they have never seen it before.
Maybe they have never seen it before.
At least it doesn't respect it.
The work here has been hidden, just before our car rental that was always transferred.
People laid there, covered the car in a fast, and so went away to switch their homes in the middle city.
"Lightful and changed general range" and "admissible citizenship" are guided by the repair of the currently overall security carrier.
The goal is to improve the area and allow the Mosaic work of the Holy Christmas at Tollhouse to enjoy a better view.
Along with the work will be a tower, and where the area is good at the sun, it is deemed to be a well - being area for the roadways.
The listing work will be opened, and the material plant will now enjoy better than before in these 142 more degrees.
In the area, small “toxicity ” will be some kind of water culture that offers games and provides the area of certain duplicates.
In this way, the restorations are described by the City of Reykjavic, along with the Witness.
Large water, heat and raftware will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their years, but the schools and the cold waters are since 1925 and have served inhabitants and businesses in the centuries of the centuries.
When it is reopened to the end, the cars can go back to it.
However, it will be a single person and in the way of creating more slow and available cleaner for the walking.
In a broadcast about the Toll House on the website of the customer, the house was taken into use in 1971, but the Architect was Gisli Halldorsson.
As a result of the gateway of the gateway, there were 250 wallless walls out of the street.
Our building name and architect agreed that such floors would have a serious effect on the entire road image, unless special arrangements were made to preach the appearance of the house.
Thus, the articles agreed to be thrown by setting up a permanent listwork there.
At that time, many words of Gerdi, a list woman, came in the meeting.
She had greatly benefited from mosaic works in Germany and in Germany.
The advice was to have a contact with her before it was decided whether the material would be associated with the work.
It was often considered that the work had to reflect the life of the porch, but the refus had been a lifetime Reykjavik since it was done.
When she was discussed with the list, she was able to trace the thought of such a work.
It was agreed that she received drawings and other assistance before she returned from a country of crime, where she would work in the foreigner’s orders.
The time she had decided to have to be required, and when she returned home, she gave some suggestions to talk.
It was accepted without fail to ask her to do the work.
It was also desired to make a comprehensive agreement with her and the famous listing company in Germany, Brothers Oidtmann, but Gerder had long been working with them to establish a higher listing work on Europe.
The agreements were taken, and Gerder worked under the establishment of the works of their brothers, who later saw the setting at the Tower House.
All the work was especially good, both half of the Holy One and Oidtman’s brothers, says in the context.
If it has later been an invisible islandic weapon.
Over two years, Gerdi worked and set up the year 1972 and 1973.
The list was two years after the Tollhouse work was completed, only 47 years old.
Subscribes to transportation of several buildings to the country
Ascending One Son of Dadai’s Society Counsel officials suggests that many public institutions will be transferred to the next country.
Regarding the Wednesday, the consequences of the tears said Sprengsand on the Biggen.
Recently, it was reported that the House and Human Activity Agency was moved north to the Ocean River.
Sex brunamic specialists work in the company, but no of them understand the north of the company and the State Association has affected the buffer transportation.
“I think we have to step more steps in this world.
I'm preparing more steps in this world.
More movement," Asmund said.
If he is convinced that the majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of public organizations around the country.
"I think it was to take more political decisions on the transport of public jobs to the country, as I was doing with the House and Human Agency," said Asmund, but he took an example of the companies that have been transported to the country and turns greatly important for communities out of the country, such as the transfer of the Food Agency to Selfoss, the Iceland's Agricultural Recommendation to Akraness and the employment unemployment security at Skagaströnd.

Don't take a seal for 27 million bitcoin crons
External taxation has refused the requirement of a fiscal investigation manager required sects over humans to degradate its feedingstuffs which were available due to the sale of the Bitcoin railway.
The fact is that the fiscal investigation manager had not made clear why it was necessary to see the man.
In the opinion of the reference, the fiscal investigation manager believed that the human understanding of materially deteriorated tax counts for the years 2016 and 2017.
He would have disappointed its potential for sales by the Bitcoin railway by 27 million, either wild or big herdlessness.
See, the man will take his mastery.
The man rejected it in a letter to the name.
However, in 2016, he sold a raw monster for 27 million.
It would have been created by a grave in 2009 and 2010 when it had been easily and harmful with a common world list.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the raffination, the sale of taxes would have been very olive and invisible because of such sales.
It would have been possible to expect public citizens to make sure of such tax payments.
He would not have intended to pay taxes from the recording, and he would have made known for his own progress as a result of the debt debt.
He would have asked both of the scientists and of the tax manager about how this would be determined but without a result.
Then he thought he needed to take into account that he was not born or born in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began to bury Bitcoin.
Thus, he would have been in a worst position than others in order to draw up the rules of taxation that would not have been clearly viewed.
Thus, the man felt right that his taxes for these two years would be re-determined and useful but that they would not be punished.
Then he entered in the Iceland and had acquired taxes in the country since 2012.
He would never have intended to deal with his debts in an obedient way.
The debt requirement would have been from a debt, and it would be worth him.
"The man understands what the football is"
Andersen Willíson has been speaking between the teeth of people, but he has grown an impact because of his advancement of what is the game with the width moment in the Pepsi Max Share.
The fireline will be taken tonight when they take IA in the direct exposure of St. 2 Sports.
The wheel takes the playback because of more reminders of the game, and thus doesn't play with a new clipping like in the games of the summer here.
He had written "black, black, black" on the hill before the game with HK last fifth day, which HK won 1-0.
“ I don’t know who almost he was responding with the account, but the speaker of those characters was better than trying in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants to get the ball every time, and if anyone was going to equate this game, I thought he would do it or put it on it," said the God Mother Benedikts son of Pepsi Max, when it was spoken to the Brilliant.
"I have to be here for people."
“ Sometimes it is difficult to understand in what situation he is.
He looks for a little left side when it's going to look at the game, but he's with a very free role in the people," Hörvar's son of Hafleid.
Thorkel Mani Petersson says that Brinjolf is a real funeral power and is happy to get such a literal person in the division: “It does not matter that this is a character.
I love it with my hair, and always be ready to meet and answer in conversations.
It's incrediblely a lot of people who tell me that this man understands what the football is.
"I'm funny.
I have to be here for people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the conversations with Brinjolf, people pay themselves in and care about what is next on their hair.
This man is just a beloved man," said Mani.
The KR player says will leave the company - "I've been related to some of the B-parts"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max Division, seems to be on the front side.
Tobias is ready to return to Danish.
Football.net determined the matter.
Tobias wants to get the beginning at the time of the household, but to that end, he needs to set up his agreement in the KR where the Danish part begins before the islandic appearance.
The company knows that I miss Danmark and has shown me a great understanding," said Tobias in conversation with Bold.
"I have been related to some aspects of the B-partition and will probably change before the Iceland Times ends.
There are no many parts in Denmark who can allow themselves to pay my agreement to the KR."
Then he says that he thinks that all the likelihoods are to take advantage of the payment in Denmark.
"The societies in Denmark have probably found more for the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland."
The Bhartmar Road has rebuilt for millions - Answers now after DV
Over years, Bhartmar Leosson has been interested in the difference between most people.
He takes up and saves tissues and stolen wheels, raw wheels and wests.
Bhartmar has seen the name "the wheel wheel" a week ago.
In the meantime, there was a number of quarters when a person showed a report of his associations with Bjartmar.
The DV showed them in a conversation on Facebook groups of Western Citys, where Bjartmar took the man in the Eastern Walk and said the wests might be stolen.
Nothing else was able to read from the original writings of the graphics, but Bhartmar had discovered him.
These texts have now been changed to Facebook and the original DV news updates in accordance with it.
Initial news of the matter, Bhartmar does not describe what really occurred in the Eastern Wales.
Bhartmar said that they had received information from the victims of the rabbis that they were actually their rabbis.
The information was obtained by the owner, but the information was evidently known as Bjartmar.
“I saw the guy and I learned the shooter, finally with information about that there was a crash that had missed very long and looked for it.
Of course, I was awesome first, but when I saw him standing ready to walk on the shooter, I decided to strive to talk to the man.
The owner was sure in his mind, and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Often I go very well in such things, but before I finished what I had to say, the man had taken my word."
Bhartmar says that the man on the railway has been subject to his order to show him the wheel wheel, and he himself called to the police.
"Yes, we're thrown," Bhartmar said, "we'll just get this clean."
Thus, the owner’s graphics proved the property of its rubber.
Later, the right owner of his story said, as in the previous news, about Facebook.
In this bed of Bjartmar, he says that he can speak the time he has shown to people in his hands.
"I have been in peaceful relations with the most difficult people of Reykjavik," Bhartmar said and pointed out that the driverships are at least the least brothers and sisters of the society, foolish, mental people and other people who are on the road.
"The female is a hard household, and somebody needs a next dose, because, unfortunately, it is easier to do so," says Bhartmar.
“ My relationship with these people is actually so good that I have come with many of the good people with me.
Examples are that people have joined and taken themselves and so looked for me and helped me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bhartmar’s association with a railway people on a curteous notes.
Suo knows about him and what he is doing and offers peacefully to show him a wheel, a star number, and so.
The motorcycle is a big problem that has been severely dealt with.
Moreover, Bjartmar says that the police is more to tell people to talk to him outside the stolen wheels.
Birtmar is an inconsistent with the previous DV news transfer and is not saying to be a different type of self-employed police in a personal way to justice.
Asking if he is not now on his throat with his illness, and whether this is not the first role of the police, Bhartmar certainly says that it is.
“ Of course, the police has to do this, but the evidence of the matter is that the police is clearly not to do this.
I've got to imagine a look up the police running away from a big rock of stolen wheels.
She's clearly expressed in the matters."
"When the police doesn't do anything in this, and this is just before your nose, and the experience has shown that I can benefit in this case, then what is it?" Bjartmar asked.
He said that he had so many results in having on the stolen wheels that sometimes he was on his “shooters ” on the street that they had just the right wheel of Bhartmar that they had already reached.
The time Bjartmar called for police assistance has caused her to be unable to.
"This is not just working with the police, and it is not teaching me, and it is not my own ways to teach," Bhartmar said, and it seems to be easier for victims of the carrier's driving ships to face an empty rate of policies in this case.
The results of Bhartmar are not divided.
In fact, people can find stories of thanks to Bhartmar for giving their own back to them.
He himself says that Bjartmar has long been ready to cut the number on the full wheel he has seen, but the heatings are, of course, running millions, unless millions.
Railways, railways and railways, but railways can cost under half million.
It works a day at the game school, and other works on a weekend.
So his way of road is an unrecompenseful work that he works in his time of freedom.
Lives and long shadows
In 2019, Iceland was a great anniversary in the history of life in Iceland.
Of course, the ambassadors had received a recompense from the King of Danish all the ways since the 19th century, but in 1919, the livelihood of the ambassadors was established, which finally became the livelihood of all public workers.
The foundation of the current salaries of the general salaries was later placed with the military carriers on the work market in 1969, where there was a question of employment related animals with obligation and full sugar collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974 there were laws based on these agreements, and the system of life was determined to pursue it.
The life system of the salaries was not the only extreme events that the 20th century’s workling appealed to its nutrition.
Employment unemployment insurance had been acquired by similar ways in historical workshops in 1955, and the generals had a few of their requirements for illness and illness, serious oral rights, labour time-release, increasing in households and in many cases.
All of these rights cost great and strange fights, but it was experienced, after understanding, much more and more sustainable cherubs than the persecution of the ears in the salaries, which left the same way in the valuation as the period of war until 1990.
The leader to the establishment of the general livelihood in 1969 was both long and long.
Although humans finally agreed that the maritimes would actually be a real property of maritime partners, the workling force was to fall on that their governments would be ordered to employees and maritime partners too.
In the next year after the summer establishment, the requirement for the majority of the workshops in the southern government often came to talk in general salaries, but it has never reached it, and therefore we still have an unusual prejudice to the representatives of the southern communities.
In Article 36 of Law No. 129/1997 on the obligation to ensure the safety of animal rights and the functionality of animals, the feedingstuffs of the sea are based on.
In the first chapter, “the lives are to have the benefit of a maritime partner’s leadership. ”
The number 5 states: “The blood vessel will be putting morally in the feeds. ”
In the Lifeyris Sea Subject, inter alia, the following are included, in the light of ancient legislation:
The Life Survey is part of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on the obligation of feedingstuffs, together with many of the largest livelihoods and western farmers and in Europe.
The rules relate to how the impact on environmental and social matters can contribute to improvement of the financial year-based e-mails.
That is how the initiatives of the community’s goal and the goal of a closer relationship are assembled.
LV considers important that partners, especially those in the post markets, have public policies: to have good management risks of social responsibility and environmental responsibility.
The Life Sea Sea Valdi, which is with the largest sea of the country, has set “a strategy on responsibilities for feedingstuffs ” and is increasing in the same areas.
It is all set up here as an entry to the newest word of the islandism, “shooting management. ”
Since this is new in this matter, it is not hope that it has been determined to be observed, but the following definition now appears to be "the most accepted": the administration is already in the case of a leader of a community in the fields that he will send to the representatives of the company a recommendation or a recommendation on how they should be taken into consideration.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be allowed to be removed from the government with the first difficulty.
If the leader doesn't go with this in the field and doesn't talk about a story, however, it's not the end of the "shopping management" of such relations, of course, forever in the farming worlds, as elsewhere.
I let the reader think about the way he feels “shooter. ”
There are particularly two people who have tried to meet this definition when it is written, on Wednesday 25 July 2020.
They are the Holy Son of Egis, a newspaper in the Newspaper, and Ashgeir Jonsson, a sedimentary manager.
The case of both occurred after that Bogi Nils Bogson, leader of the Icelandair, had said from his plan to deal with the agreements of the company with flight freedoms and aeroplanes (reporting them) and Ragnar Thor Inífsson, president of the Reykjawik Business Society, sent them out to the representative of the Lifeyris Society of the company to not purchase the potential purchases of the sea in the company, and they learned to be defeated.
Some later, the Book of Nils took his decision back and in the road, Ragnar Thor took the same way as his command, of course, to God’s decision.
However, they saw the Earth and the Ashgaere reason to consider the matter in the Quartoday magazine with great words of shadow management, lawbreaks, and needs for changes in law.
There was a small one who would truly worry to a heavy voice, although the blessed youphen had been in a connection risk, and it was quickly dried out.
Since the matter is important, let us think of the matter in the end.
I was here before the issues of the Law on Life Aids that are involved in this matter.
It includes that the maritime administration should examine the economics of the maritime partners and have a moral adjustment in the farms, and these aspects are closely implemented in both the Gildis and the Lifeyris commercials as I mentioned.
However, life-shirts do not have to look at single doses in their feedingstuffs.
It would be just a great risk of such policies and should not long be searched for such judgments in the past, where a big outermost banks and sugars have run to unusual livelihoods and environmental conditions, with dangerous consequences.
The leader of Icelandair was obviously on his hair when he thought to dry out a whole group of employees, taking so much from the well - being that the company has used in the island markets and deteriorating the situation against the farmers.
It's better that he saw it and dropped it back.
The time shows whether it leads to the ability of feeding animals in the company to speak responsibility for maritime companions.
The author is an ancient professor of natural and scientific history.
One of the inhabited people did not allow a home visit
One of the three distinguished with Covid-19 in the country came to the country from East Salt on July 15, about one and half week ago.
He is a Icelander who is not regularly identified here, and thus has not received clear guidelines to attend such calling home meetings after the arrival to the country and to go to another show for a few days after the arrival.
He got no part of the screening at the border.
"But he is in a Icelandic community and actually has to go to that extent," says Camilla daughter Josephs, a expert in the country's home area and a local physician while he is in summary, talking with the Newspaper today.
"He used the English file format and there is no obligation to file the teacher and if the teacher is not written, you are not automatically announced in the later view."
She says that the man could have used the English file format because he is actually a foreigner, but because of his association in the country that the islander had to use.
However, he did not understand.
“ When the teacher is not recorded, you need to seek it yourself to come in the later show.
Neither he nor his employer seemed to have realized that it was the right way," camella said.
“ It is evident that we feel that we have the information about this while we find some way to make a self - ministerial system, although the Islandians do not record their teacher.
Or to make it somehow clearer who are participants in a Icelandic society in the recording system," she explains.
It is better to go around, though, to reach the country’s arrival, although it is defined as a participant in the Icelandic society, the islandian.
Only six have been sent to the battle after he was distinguished and these six were all together with him.
They have to go to a show, but two of them are going to show the symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
On July 15, the man received a noise from his vision at the border.
Camella probably says that he had recently been infected by the virus that she couldn’t understand in him when the display was taken to the border.
However, she does not want to use the man’s infection here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with herself to the country.
"It is not able to conclude that this is safely imported infections because it's a long time later that he came to the country that he thought he had been exposed here like these two who have had a little war in relations with the idrotemote."
Yet, she says that it is very unlikely because the man’s decay is surrounded.
“It is really very unlikely, ” says Kamilla, but it states that it is not possible to be used before Icelandic physician is just to distinguish the virus in humans.
"If we get a virus that hasn't seen here before, it's almost safe that he has brought it to the country."

Solitaire: Not the game that defines our time

"But what happens to them is not the end of our travel, because we still have a number of countries by reaching the two steps above us," Solskir said.
It is evident that people’s sickness will be at 15 hours today, but the Solskir tried to make it like each other’s game was talking.
“If you want to belong to Manchester United, you must be used to be under pressure in the last time game.
Nothing is new, and the company is based on it.
We have made a great opportunity to finish the time well, and now it's our use of it," said the Sunny.
“ This is not the most important game of the time, this is only the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important.

The fear of other fields of age
The Government in Spain is now trying to retain the COVID-19 extension in the country.
The Spanish Health Society took place more than 920 new cases COVID-19, both on Friday and Friday.
There have not been any more evidence of one sunrise from the beginning of May and the issues at the same time and the Spanish people begin to deal with the most worst outcome in Europe.
The bacchester led to the fact that the French authorities now deserved travelers from Spain to go to the village at home.
Week ago Spain was on the British list of security.
The situation is what happens in Catalonia in North East of Spain, where governments have reached the higher limits to try to reach growth.
In the city of Barcelona, the next two weeks will be closed and the houses will be closed at midnight.
The outcome is now a value for 200 thousand people in Segria in the West Catalonia.

Tui, the largest travel office of the United Kingdom, rejected all the flights that we had foretold today to Spain and Canary.
The worldwide governments are told to prepare themselves for later age, but it seems to be a little interested to recover to the scope of the outcome that has caused the economy to be destroyed.
To imagine, Boris Johnson, president of Bretagne, has taken very bad in such a way as the nuclear opening that he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, Prime Minister of France, said that the nation “will not come from life, physical or social, ” if it would be taken back to the countrywide outcome.
Many advisers hope for this local challenge that will reach the home of individual cities, towns, or areas in order to restore the virus in the next time it comes.

In the report of the publics, one infection is linked to the inflammation reported in the ReyCUP footballtamoth.
He has been sent in an unity and sixteen who were closely associated with him in a distress.
The infection was involved in the social work of the Reykjavic developing society, which is the joint declaration, "only part of the idrotechnology".
Others who sent us into a distress are linked to men in a different way.
The origin of this infection is not found and the mixture is completely not found in the mixture atmosphere administrator.
ReyCUP counterparts have followed the guidelines and rules of gender physician and public administrators that still exist and have made appropriate advice.
Yet, images of the meeting were awakened with a very close conjunction to enjoy the good course of their face outside the wall.
Right before 11 hours today, the meetings showed the following announcement on their Facebook page.
There is “ATH: Parents please appreciate the rules of purchasing their own daughter at school.
Parents are not allowed to do so.
Thank you for shown understanding."
Another pattern was clear, but it was related to the deletion that was reported in the previous year.
The notice says: “Icelandic physician has defined the infection and has made a new type of virus that has not been known here before. ”
The effort is to meditate in this matter and is to be infected in a single and 12 in anxiety due to the infection.
The third infection is from a person who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15th.
He seems to be found in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now single and six who were closely associated with him in a distress.
Two of them are already going to show the symptoms of the virus.
In addition, two of the border borders were determined and were requested for further studies, such as the infections of the border.
Finally, in the announcement, the general source of legislation managers and the country’s responsibility involves people’s care and careful thinking of individual diseases.
Game at least doubts whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present in the same request to go to a show at the next health level.
Patreksphore says that the tent area is built on business health - Beans goes otherwise
The area of Patreksfest is completed in the weekend, together with the announcement of the West Construction.
Guests are noted to see other guests.
The names of the Western village Beldudal, the Talknahrad, Melanes, the Red River, the Hotel Flokalund, and the Hotel Breitnavik, which were other choices in the position.
Nothing is about to be at the Patreks Festival of this holiday, for, as the previous year, the town of the islandic households will be held in prayer.
She has been maintained later in 2007, so it is said that it is stronger in prayer.
In order to judge in the tent area, a good measure of this year can be assessed if weather doesn't make a county, but DV said earlier today from the conclusion of the prophecy.
However, the worst weather can be expected, and the expectation of Patreks.
The web bb.is first said, and said that all other guests in the prayer were already completed.
It's the best place in the city.
Romanian workers live free in Dunhaga 18-20.
During their ownership of building permits to restore, their ownership has succeeded in the system for the third year.
In one of the elderly, greenest, and the beast towns of Reykjavik, a wide range of triple houses is at three high places.
At the earthquake of the house, there are approximately 600 degrees of business.
The back of the house is the door of two steps that hold four places around it.
They are at range 93 to 130 metres, but most of them are over 100.
The house has a valuable story to store.
It was built in 1959, including video, the School, the Milk Chamber of Milk Sales, Joa’s arms, fishing salt, and now the last Haskolaprint.
The house, so that it is possible to speak, has made her mouth more beautiful.
The house is now under great shame, as can be seen in the pictures that are produced.
The owner of the house is D18 hf.
The owners of D18 e.v. are a common company file among the other Magnus son Magnus and Godrun Holy Larus daughters.
Magnus went to the property group of the Bourgian, and he was a defendant of the Bourgen’s ownership.
In a group of ownerships of the Company of Borgani, the Staffship is.
The ship of the ship is a feeding community of the Holy Lazarus daughter and her children.
Godhrun is also owned in D18 e.c.
God and her husband, August the Son of Sigurd, once denied the ship of the ship.
D18 e.v. purchased the house in Summer 2009, and there has been a little that has not been observed at the last time.
Saying to the neighbors that the situation of the house has been constantly disappointed, however, most recent years.
On the Facebook site, a resident says that the house has “not been especially living last years. ”
There it may be that the owner has occurred over a few years after changing the house and address.
Other neighbors say that the house hasn't been fine for long.
"There is a long time to do something generally with this blast and evidently that this has been such a way."
He even says that he is filled with the house’s owner because he has not been able to finish this, found a common floor with the neighborhoods and stopped this “law of law. ”
"Do this only in concert with the community in the circle, so you can drive it and finish it."
The ‘lawmaking stage’ of the facility indicated is the organisational case of the road which has been in force since 2017.
The owner of Dunhaga 18 and 20 looked for a house to build the height above the current holiday house and behind the house, a new hydrocarbon and a building at one height of the caller.
The building authorisation provided for the progress was addressed to the Environmental and Resource Environmental Designation and the decrease referred to as a non-compliance in the division and the transparency was not satisfied.
The town of Reykjavic took place with a division and ended with an announcement in the Governing Body of July previously.
The organisation was aware of it, and the name was determined by the value of March 2020.
At that time, there were nearly three years from the initial invitation to building authorisation and the owner of the house at the beginning.
At that time, the house had been deteriorated in numbers and the neighbors had to be comforted.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house to the state and response of our neighbors in different ways.
Su's had understanding the plans of the house, and others didn't.
Others went to the city, not others.
Others were just angry, but nothing finally out of no one.
Others reported the car treatment, but neighbors have newly unusual Dunhaga carships under their equipment.
A leader in the case said a long-term pressure on the Governing Body:
“Let us think about walking in the trigger trip is extremely incredible.
It's like Reykjavikir city can't read."
Today, the house is empty, left, and is inactive.
The Memorial of the town’s self - control and the town’s spectacles designates the owner and many years of the work of those who are at the beginning.
When a journalist came to the garden of Dunhaga 18, he was thrown up the doors and the roof.
Playstation television and new television were low inside another waste on the earth — a victim of the islandic residue.
It was opened into the old Haskolaprents office, and there was a number of the bones of the illness to judge.
It is evident that someone has seen himself in one corner, but no one is visible.
Bottles of sleep and beds and some broadcasts of the physician pages that, of course, were to be stuck.
The gateways of the house were even open and lived in both of them.
The journalist was so happy to replace the residents of the other.
The Romans were there to take a cartridge for dinner and offered to the journalist.
The Romans work for Ztrongforce's work.
They have been there for some hours and military officers of DV that the company had nothing to do with the home except heat and energy.
The way of the house’s condition does not seem to be defenceful.
A number of foreign workers in the last losses has been determined by the postal in the house’s opposite court.
Officers haven't been delayed by Covid-19, the end of a negotiation in a travelling way to negotiations in the building officers, and these two are what is the most important to use the service of employees.
Nevertheless, at Dunhaga 18 households have enough to do, and they have distracted the employment jobs and the billions in the community after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that, despite the delicate condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared was well maintained.
When a journalist squad the boy's boy, he suddenly became a wardrobe: At the best place in Reykjavik, 1.500 feasible decreases are fixed.
The own will changes the house to the battery and the neighbor's will adds the status, but parts of the definition of the "bad".
In the midst of this town's organizational area at the beginning of the court, the victims of an unfinished defense and public history in the organizational negotiation and the equivalent solution of the Environmental and Resource Name.
In the house there are such Roman workers, perhaps those who are going to improve the situation when the islanders stop riding.
The article appeared initially in the DV of July 17.

There are women," he said.

That's what we're just coming to lead these changes."

“ Then we are not likely to consider what we need to do.
Like the Gentiles, they are very conscious of their story and see what they need to do.
It's a fucking crazy.
We need to know from where we are coming and knowing the story and listening.
Listen to rows of seven groups.
We don't live in the same rules here," he said.
She asked women to be in many ways in good cases in Iceland, but added to build the island elsewhere with a rosa man’s value.
She said that the policy was turned to form its own importance, authority, and authority that would be the role of committing unrighteousness in all communities.
"The women are now ready to set up this group and come together and have just become a little pirate that the University will move to look forward to this national statement since 2012," she said.
“ This is the common value we are thinking about.
Without human rights and natural protection, society, and that we are actually sitting at the same level," she said, and added that the remote value would be a basic value in the new government record.
“We are a very rich land of natural suffering, and it is unfortunate that there are people who live in poverty.
It's incredible, we're able to turn aside," said Helga.
“ It is unfortunate that there is a natural law that women are always lower.
It's unfortunate that aeroplanes and scientists finally stand in charity only to achieve human recompenses."
A signature of the new control file can be signed here in the format of Iceland.

"Some thoughts to fire" - See Eliza Amara's food headquarters
Elisea's daughter is an affair in the puzzle and plays with Val.
She is also the master of food, mother, and she works as a food scientist.
She needs great energy for the day’s eggs and gives her often time to burn good and rich food.
I have a regular day to meet the job from eight, says Elizabeth.
"When I worked, I'm going to the ship to prepare the dinner before I get my girl at the game school at about three hours."
Elisea feels very eager to get her daughter to the game school soon.
“ It’s good to have time with her before I’m in practice later.
After exercising, it's good to come home and just try to hide the food.
On the evening, when the girl is sleeping, we feel good to look at one part to clean the mind."
Elizah doesn't have any specific food.
She is putting finishes on the master type of food and knowing what it can eat to have enough energy to make jobs, schools, family, and exercise.
“ What I can do is eat of food that is well combined with proteins, colvets and foods.
However, I feel the most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not a poor food in swimming, or good, food or nutritional use.
It's negatively all right to eat everything, but not everything in the same and not always."
Elisea is very interested in the fire.
“ I feel certain thoughts about standing in the firehouse and bringing it very much into it.
I have to say that my self-confience is with me in the fire house, and I believe that I am a good cook."
Morning morning: Hafras, chia-brothers, hamperry, salt, small citron-saves, lay meat at night.
Top this meal so that it exists every time.
Often there is a banana and a supported & KAFFI.
I'm a big coffee.
Millimeter: Incrediblely misconscious, but fruits or fats, flashes, clean shirts with the bananas and muscles, bread with pressure, and so I eat hummus with a box up, if so.
Headishment: I often live for all kinds of food sales from what is in the issap, cinema or building, falafel balls, cells, superpacked with good dress is something I'm doing with.
If the organization goes completely out of the bands (which is often happening), the egg machines in the work have often saved me, and there are two breads with wheat, wheat, and soft eggs, and don't leave you anymore.
Millimeter: Give me something valuable for exercises, bread with pressure, morning or fruit.
Nightmare: Fisheries will be very often for the choice in my home, otherwise some of the famous rights.
Consequences between police and Seattle counterparts
Citizenships in Seattle in Washington have been described as a rebellion in the middle of the city.
The police took steps to blow down and piparude to try to drive a large area that the opposite placed in the town and moved over many houses in the neighborhood of the city.

Not revoked before rereading
Not yet if the results of Icelandair flight free will be revoked for the next month.
Icelandair's raffination of the Icelandair's Airfree Society's carrier report ends on midnight tomorrow.
The divine line of John’s daughter, the leader of the company, is sure that Icelandair will not make a decision on the consequences before the conclusion of the presentation.
"This is completely relevant," says God-law Line.
“ There have been no revocation, this must be considered that the machines can be managed.
So, of course, people are unconfortable after getting to know if it's gonna be working after the month."
The question is the agreement signed a week ago, on July 19th.
It is advised that he is valued until September 2025 and is based on an agreement that aeroplane freed before.
On July 17, Icelandair’s Free Society’s Government and Aviation Council agreed to preach universal work at Icelandair.
It never came to her, but this was decided in the case of Icelandair's decision to stop talks with the Flight Free Society, to tell all its flights and to search for agreements with another local community.
Then the company’s flighters had to take a timely safeguard.
A question of how she thinks that the record will go, says God - feared Linney hard to talk about it.
“The people are injured after this Icelandair, when all the flights of the company were told and announced that they would be together with another community.
Now it seems to be clear if it has a effect," she says.
At the end of April, 940 airlines were released in Icelandair, and then 900 of them, approximately 95 per cent, were reported.
Their exposure is a mistake, in those with the most employment, it is three months and thus ends on July-Agosto.
These groups have about 90% of Icelandair flights.
What do we take if the agreement is not acceptable?
“ Then we want to talk to our advisers about literal conversations.
With this agreement, we meet the needs of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flights have been walked too far."
If the nutritional analysis ends and Icelandair reports the second quarter of the morning
If a flight-free aircraft is resolved, it will end at 12 hours a midnight tomorrow.
In the second quarter of the year, Icelandair will be shown tomorrow, but the extent of the extent of the exhibition is indicated that the company’s assumptions have decreased about 85 per cent from the same time before.
Icelandair’s raffination report on Icelandair’s Free Society Airlines and Samtaka’s Employment Reviews on midnight, July 22, and ends tomorrow, on Monday 27 July, at 12 p.m.
Those who are able to choose the agreement are Icelandair employees who provide a company to the Flight Free Society.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new shipment on Sunday 19 July, while Icelandair had previously discussed the company after the airlines had previously concluded a detail at the beginning of July.
Then Icelandair told all the flights and flights of the company on Friday, but they were back after the signature of the new kernel.
In addition, the new aeroplanes will fly for five hours a month before the same award.
The charaxis is valued until 2025, but there is to meet the rate of the aircraft and fleeting along how long it can fly on one wake.
The contract was known to FFI’s companions at the Hillton Nordica Hotel last month, and many airlines that talked to them about disapproval because of the agreement.
However, most people agree that the agreement should be accepted in order to keep life.
The Icelandair report for another fourth year will be informed tomorrow than the EBIT company, its recruitment for feedingstuffs and taxes, consistently from the extent of fraudulencies from about 100 to 110 million American Valleys or about 15 billion islandic crowns.
Icelandair sent the purchases on the last weekend, which said that the company’s approximately 60 million dollars on the quarter or approximately 8.3 billion crons.
At the end of the quarter, approximately 21 billion crowns of the American Value was a handful and equal value.
Icelandair is also taking the steps to invite the company’s share in August.
Icelandair has to conclude agreements with fifteen farmers, governments and Boeing aircraft manager for a month before it comes into a submission message.
New rejected virus rather than new type
“ The new virus only means that it has been a person from a foreign country.
"It is not something that has been scheduled here," says Mar Kristäns son, on the events of the National Hospital's infectional divisions, as it questions that "new kind of virus" has been known here in the country.
Three internal areas were divided into two borders.
One who seemed to have participated in the social work of a developing society at the Rey Cup Narcotics, but the origin of the infection has been unrecognized and mixed.
E_BAR_ Smalls were detected in persons who arrived to the country on July 15, and were two who were in conjunction with him beginning to demonstrate the symptoms of COVID-19.
Then the infections related to the interaction reported in the previous year and after a definition of the Icelandian pharmacovigilance appeared in the light of “new type of virus which has not been known here before”.
The mixture has been completed in connection with that smit.
It is not to talk to a new virus but it is the same virus and has changed around the world, i.e. the new SARS-CoV-2 coronary.
It is more right to talk about new reactions from that virus than about new virus.
A question of what it means and whether it intended to say something about the beginning of another playing, Mark says that, as the case is, it was not to talk and that it was going to go so that there would be nothing more.
"But if it comes to an internal case which is not linked to an alien and is with the same heritage as this, it would be possible to conclude [the later advice], but it is untimely to support it," explains Mars.
Happiness in the name of the football
Does the secret of the happiness of the Islanders have been hidden in the headquarters?
The BBC day-to-day operators thus lead to a pleasant video band that prevents the light of the land’s heat- and heat-power-compression.
The Icelandic battle is especially in the worldwide, and it is known that none of the world’s places are similar to the inhabitants.
The natural earthquake is based on it, but it has been for the deterioration that is here.
In 1940, children were legally educated, but older citizens have no longer been able to use their water for health.
Health speeds are described as a solid part of the general welfare of the land.
In the foot, everyone is equal, independent of the state and the position.
As farsims, people are assembled on personal nights about the home and the household or the use of the similar water power — thinking and guarding of souls and body.
Once a hundred days in the choices will be taken
Hundreds of days are there until the Americans go to the election and choose themselves to be presidents for five years.
Donald Trump's looking for backing, but he's on the back.
Joe Biden, the expectative Promotion of the Democratic Group, has a great pre-shot on Trump in the countrywide, has been taken in the middle of the visitors.
The newer study of the AP newspaper believes that the United States’ mediums are on the road.
Trump’s reactions due to the worldwide new coronary are, likewise, very hostile, and also count more Americans than before the president has kept injury to economic matters.
Only two of the ten Americans say that the United States are on the right way.
32 percent of Trump’s reactions are stated because of age and 48 percent say that he has maintained a well-being materials.
In March there was 56 percent and in January 67 per cent.
The average FiveThirtyEight is ≥ 49.9% of the countrywide than ≥ 41.9% of Trump.
Trump himself has tried to take attention from his presence to Biden’s age, to submit so - called educational parts, and to announce a policy that is to turn to laws and rules.
However, Biden’s instruction is very strict to keep the attention of Trump and considers that it is likely to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to carry out the case if the option actually turns out how Trump has been in work for the last four years.
The enemy Trump seems to get down to the prisoners of the Republic and fear the Democracy even gained the majority of the United States elderly services, which has come here despite very powerful.
Politico said that it was not common and promoted, and that now the Republican group would have its most degree in the decades.
The outcome has experienced the groups especially in the 2016 drafts, and now it appears that the development will continue.
Trump has in the past days tried to fear the inhabitants of an exhibition, including by saying that Biden is president, he will destroy the United States exhibitions and submit sexual interactions.
Meanwhile, Trump has fallen down a rule from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase the change in the areas.
Then he urged the "houseman" of the United States to read the article of the former New York assistant manager, where she claimed that Biden would destroy the American economy and took Trump under it.
“The hope will destroy your dreams and the American dreams.
I will keep it, and even do it better!" said the President.
America's evacuation population is a totally increased crops of choosers.
Similarly, the NPRs are about half of all the carriers in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was repeated in 2004, the invitation that has received the majority of the premiums to address this group became president.
Unless in 2012, Mitt Romney received more money from this group but lost Barack Obama.
The views have shown that, despite the fact that Trump has acquired a great majority of the 2016 emissions, his ability has severely combined.
Although it is different between the tests, Biden has reported about fifty percent pre-scale in Trump in the excipients.

Will the Olympics be lighted at the end of the time?
After the final decision had been taken to determine the Olympicals, events that only world wars have made it, the President of the International Olympy Society said that the Olympics would be “the light at the end of the past, ” and there expected a worldwide coronary that the world building now goes into the community.
The African people have a year to prepare themselves, and Japan’s governments have improved their costs because of late delay.
Yet, everyone holds the head too much in the hair.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan, the Olympical Olympium of our year, the Japanese representatives were unwitched.
They wept and cried at a time, but Tokyo had sought to stay in 2016, but it changed in a lower place for Rio in Brazil.
At this time, the Tokyo city and Japan would pray for the attention of the world.
The games were to go from 24 July to 9 August, but they have been tried for a year and have been tried in place of 23 July 2021 and ended on August 8, 2012.
If you don't want to keep them low, if the coronary is still too busy, it will be stopped.
Nevertheless, no one wants to think about them.
Olympicals are not a normal inflammation.
Nothing is saved, the view is always to be great and trying to reach the last game.
The choice of the city for Olympicality is based on the importance of the cities.
So greater than this is — more likely to get the nose.
Tokyo was 150 million dollars trying to maintain the Olympical 2016 or, as a result of about 20 billion billion billion billion billion billion.
Latestly, at the end of 2020, 75 million dollars, approximately 10 billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion
In 2013, when Tokyo was determined for a year, Japanese governments had a number of billion billion billion billion billion billion billion.
However, this is only a screen in the sea, which is the cost of building an Olympical village, players, and generally strengthening the country’s integration to consult such meetings, preparing it and maintaining itself.
Japan’s publicists have said that the Olympicals in Tokyo, which had to be on this day, but have been tried for a year because of the coronary, would have costed $12,6 billion.
However, in a report of the Japanese missionary report that ended the last year, the cost was nearly a double talk.
It is probably not able to put adequate food on the cost of maximizing the games, but it has been planned that it could cost at two to six billion dollars to adjust to the initial cost.
The Japanese Olympics and Japanese tax collectors were therefore driving at approximately 15 to 30 billion dollars.
There are so high numbers that all the taxes of the Icelandic are only about half of the Olympicals, as well as the less possible costs.
Olympicals are the case of the majority of the fact that they have become a recycling factor of economics who are trying to explore in numbers and view the benefits and processing of the games.
In most cases, many have seemed to have concluded that the effects of the Olympicals are late as well as the material of their payment.
The dose effects are some, for example, very much to a short time, but for a longer time, the city is located up with debt and an unclean eye recruits smaller human activity.
Rio in Brazil has been a real debt for 2016 and has been in trouble to cover all the great involving activities that have been based on our debt.
The performance has been in numbers in London in 2012, but only 10 percent of the employees in the city were unemploymentless before.
It means that it wasn't about speaking a new screen but a little bit.
In general, cities have not been particularly well-handed to maintain olympicality because of such costs that are not for human activity based on age.
Nevertheless, the benefit is determined in the visit to visit the Olympical cities, which, though, is very uncertain about the 2021 warning.
It is uncertain whether it is possible to take into account all of the number of views that usually get a league.
However, it is the honour that the cities will have to be powerful, but it is difficult to feed.
Despite the great costs, it is also possible to say that the joy that the players carry is not the nature of putting it on a value.
Yet, although the view is worthwhile and is not saved, it is of course not just about money.
It's the idrocarbons that are in front.
Before some African people, it is only a loved one of the games.
For example, the Australian five-third woman and the golden seas in its article on the final Olympicals, Chloe Es
It is, therefore, among developers who are more satisfied with the temptation, for reasons of understanding.
Before the Icelandians who were going to stop leaving for a year, they had been held at the right time, the temptation of leaving in some cases means that they stopped fighting before the players had occurred.
You simply do not trust your body to go into the roads of years in a range of stretching exercises.
Five involving people were also in the hearts of the Olympicals in Río 2016 and the Simone Biles fifth Star.
She came home with a cup of gold around her hair and one bronze.
Biles has encountered some discussions in his household in the United States to discuss the Olympical.
She's going to go on 2021, but she's not finally sure that she's still at the top of the games next year, but she'll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not a high age, it is higher for a five - year - old woman.
"This is a very important issue," says Biles, but the brossing, however, in another conversation shown on the Instagram Olympion-Page, asked whether she would reach the same time on the 2021 games and she did in 2016.
"I just don't know if I'm still on the top after a whole year in the course of age," says Biles.
She has already spoken that her body doesn’t endure the pressure that has a longer end to the fig treatment.
Yet, on the other hand, she's exercising an olympical cup for 2021.
Billes recognizes that it has been an unusual feeling that it has been uncomfortable to stop exercising suddenly when the world’s station was closed and the movie room was closed.
We had no delay for Biles more than others while all the involving activities were closed for six weeks.
All her Olympics couldn’t buy any access to the other, but she felt that she could find different ways to keep herself like others.
The basis is certainly better than in most people.
“ We have a plan now.
It was difficult to start again after the film was opened.
We started able, but we have come on a new step, and I will increase the exercise as well as after what happens in the year.
Of course, we don’t know how these games will be or whether they will be maintained, but we do not know that they will be.
I'm just putting too much on me to leave the italian now," says Biles.
Similarly, it does not mean that the games will not be held in 2021 but that it may be more conscious of that place.
To predict that, however, it is hopeless.
No one can know how the position of the worldwide Coronary Age will be made in July 2021 and nothing but preparing for Olympical Schools in order to keep them in the year.
Maybe the Olympics will be lighted at the end of the Covid trips.
Located wedding because of divorce
Modern Family player Sarah Hyland has decided to fix his wedding for the coronary.
She was supposed to marry the former Bachelorette companion Wells Adams.
"I think there are other important things to think about accurately now," the game talked with people.
“ We finally want to marry sometimes and have the dreams and all the presents we love.
However, we decided to deal with it and care for what is important today, and it is helping to share information about the importance of becoming mature and keeping home.
I'm looking more on the world than on the wedding issues of this day.
There's a lot of time, and we need to keep our attention on what's going on in the world."
