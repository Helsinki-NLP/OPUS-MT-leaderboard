The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort nor the "condition".
The new council officers of the capital of the CSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and the city representation at all.
The newspaper Currently.cz has been a little "repulsed" from the CSSD members of the new Council, as they have controlled the notorical serpent that has been held in the last years in which today’s coalition partners were in Prag at Ruder.
The coded word shadow, which was introduced by the Prague Political Elite in the deployed era by the Supertown Meister Pavel Bem, was rejected by some of the most actors, situations and cases.
It was surprised that the new advice on these new terms had gone something in darkness.
At least they claimed that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am rather a newling in the Prague," reacted Luke Kaucky, the new council for culture, to the test of the "Paten-Wortschat".
But also Mr Karel Brézina, a political veteran, responded similarly.
For example, the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present me here I'm going to use again."
"Instead, I don't think much of serpents."
From the chat that the Daily Sheet had published in June.cz in this year before the ODS election congress, the texting indicated six terms, especially those who are nottorially connected to the Prager Magistrat.
The social democrats should define the terms "voldemort", "greatest Prager Golfloch", "Go to the Condition", "Stiernacken", "Versed of the capital" and "verblen".
Three Prager Councilherrs agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, the future leader of the Prague School Society - promised first his participation in the speech, but not even dismissed the hearer.
The fifth counseller, Petr Dolininek, refused the test from before.
"I don't care about these things and how the civil democrats interview each other, I don't judge it."
"For me, it is important how we understand in the framework of our programmes," he reported.
As already said, Luke Kaucky would have not expected to recognize that the influenced entrepreneur and friend of the former citizen Bam, Roman Janoušek, was the talk.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing but Kaucky, and the only term he did correctly at the test was "the biggest Prager Golfloch".
"This is the Tunnel Blanka," says Kaucky, "but you're still safe, "but I know it better from the newspaper."
And funny, "I'll have to make a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then not only decifrated by Matador Karel Brezina, but also by the Environmental Director Lukas Plachý as Tunnel Blanka.
But both social democrates know whose term is Voldemort and Lukas Plachý even knows where this figure is to be found and what it means to go to the condition.
"I believe that it means to go into some Prager Gastronomy Business," Plachý is quite close to the race solution if you know that this is the seat of Janoushex companies.
In accordance with Brezina, however, he claims to have created these knowledge from the magazine rather than that it would be his own.
In order to judge the test participants, it seems that there is no similar shadow in the social democracy.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something like this with us."
"We call us at the name, go and again, we also use shortcuts or hotnames," says the president of the Prager CSSD Petr Hulininsky - of his partynotes salopp "Hulda".
"In the school I was called Bríza (Birke), but I don't know whether my colleagues also call me like this," Karel Brezina delivers us his name.
The Zeitung Denik currently.cz has tested the name and see - he works.
Councilsher Vinert is friendly to the parties of the "opa" or less friendly of the "ancient", representative Miroslav Poche, who took note of the election by powers in the party-sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (recognised by the Czech Lego-figure).
Names are the only one that allows social democrats in internal language use.
Hulininsky does not like it to be called "Hulda", but Denik currently.cz has registered another name of the Prague president.
His "Doctor of the Gumminknupped Rights" is intended to do that Petr Hulininsky has made his title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver Policeiacademy.
The Government wants to submit the balls of "Hexen" and gave a brochure
Women who are in Burkina Faso to Hexen, usually show some common social characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, they find no job - for example, for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
If one of these women are to be "verd", they are strictly isolated so that they cannot be able to be able to be the village.
"My men are very rarely affected by this shick Hall."
"And young and healthy women remain disappointed, since they are helping and born children," described a western sister the situation in the capital of the Western African State Burkina Faso in a special house of more than one hundred women who have been exhausted by their communities.
The local government has now decided to deal with these abnormal "social measures".
And for this reason, a brochure was to underline the "hexen persecution".
But the thing has a hack.
"More than 70% of all wake up in Burkina Faso can't read," says the magazine "the standard" to the dilemma of the scripture.
However, in other African countries it is also to be taken into consideration of the hexership.
In Ghana, the neighborland of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahowa was followed by three women and two men to die - they dropped them with petroleum and simply burned them.
The BBC server also reported this event.
However, the workers claimed that the thing would only be a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version, oil waste to be used for ritual salts.
And even after the group tried to "eject a bad spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "hexen" is subjected to people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Fresseries of human souls are earlier like today," he said.
Since the Government in Burkina Faso has at least tried to exhaust the Hexenjagd, the president of the president's previous year has agreed with it.
"President Yahya Jammeh deceived a monstrous Hexenjagd after his grandfather's death, because they were likely part of their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"To that he called Shamane from near Guinea to help those who, in response to police, soldiers and the body of the president's body, had taken up women and men violently from villages and kept on the farm of the president in Canilai," said the organization Amnesty International in its report.
On the farm, the injured people were forced to drink a absurdity from pfs with hallucine, which also caused darm and renal problems.
Two of the treated people did not survive the residence on the farm.
Only because of international pressure, the nearly thousand prisoners were released again.
A mister of Bakala: Although he is heavy in the oven - yet he pays myths
An elderly understood man just leaves the client's company RPG Byty of the "Cohlebaron" Zdenek Bakala, the largest owner of households in Czechland.
Under the arm a map with three new contracts of conference to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who just put a prison penalty.
All three were just added in the context of "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns of months, the son will take up for a 2 room apartment in the next year with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is not even a floating heat water in the apartment, and you need to be heated in a simple coal-open," he tips in anger with the finger on the new Son's mid-contract, whose signature he has a full power.
"But what - I've subscribed," he explains half voting and half resigned.
The Civil Association BytyOKD.cz, which covered the new conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises the center to simply not sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, where it remembers a guide to publicly as it is to be done against such contracts.
But the man's just getting away.
"It says this, the other one," he makes a window face.
The Ostrava region will become such a great "deregulation labour".
After the new year, this deregulation is the most of the villages in Czechland, whose owners do not have had any responsibility.
Currently.cz therefore decided to visit this "Labor" personally.
The RPG wartery in Havířov is full of one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine hours in the morning.
The bodyguards of a security agency and a calling device are located near the door.
"Mite 2011", thus lights a special keyboard on the touch.
Shortly typed and the device has already expressed a number piece.
Sometimes we decipted the number "157" and already bound it on the large display at the cover of Wartera.
A half second later, you're on the row.
Something later, an elderly couple comes to the guard to ask for the chair, but the wind in the hall is obviously not applicable to the new town.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance and similar matters.
Since middle November, the Kuverts in the region of Ostrava, with the new contracts of conference, are located in the majority of the 44.000 apartments of the Portfolio of the RPG in the letter boxes.
The RPG Byty proposes in writing an increase of approximately 15 to 38 Pro.
The special exchange for new meetings in the customer room has been opened since 18 November.
"The action is running something about a week, which means it's first the beginning," the ladies behind the switcher answer after a moment, when the "client" comes out as a journalist.
Deregulation and earliest mountain work apartments are a brisante subject.
Before the election, the President of the Parliament Vice-President Lubomir Zaorálek from the CSSD took this topic quite loudly, not wondering that the newspapers are full of it today.
"Twenty years I want a new foot of them."
"WC-Brille couldn't switch them," the incoming man's insected air.
In particular, the employees are at the switch to be convinced that they are actually obtaining the promised compensation that the RPG promises to them when they sign the special long boat on time.
In the enjoyment of one reductioned February, the other members who are signing the new conference contract shall also come to the end of 15 December.
Until now, "deregulation switcher" is in Havířov, but everything else is not overloaded by questions.
"From the 360 crossed customers were only about 40 to 50 of the town in 2011 for this reason," estimates the wallet officers.
RPG offers individual meeting agreements, where necessary, both on their websites and on wall tables.
However, if the members are not at the new staff, they will be established by an independent court.
"It should not be a choice, but it is as information about the only possible and fully legitimate legal procedures," RPG states on its websites.
"No one goes before the court," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man on the street before the customer's room gives her at least partly right.
"I have 13,000 (chrons) rents, remaining five thousand for me to eat, where I should take the money for a court fight," he says.
Then the employees will be uncertain.
"See."
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them about the media that they don't want to sign and that people still wait," it gives them to think.
The regulated post ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic to the new year 2011 and RPG Byty is an economic need.
"The existing height of the rents is not even enough to maintain the residence fund," said Pavel Klimès, the director of the RPG Byty Apartment Portfolios Society, and - just the criticised delay of the apartment fund is, as the home owner of the main reason for the increase of the capital.
The RPG could invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the entered offices, and in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it would be 5.2 billion.
On the large-formated LCD display on the cover against the pools in the wartery of Havířov, there are still some red lighting information.
"The increasing in 2011 by 15% and less than 31 200 apartments, which means more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"Always this means at least 7,50 CZK per square meter and month", it is read on the LCD monitor.
Only at 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, the midst increases by 38%.
"In these cases, the increase is extremely lower than 19.66 CZK per square meter," arguments RPG.
At 2600 apartments, the village remains at the same height in the next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation does not explode to the height, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
Moreover - the company has a further commitment: All revenues from the Mieterhood (see graph) would want the company to return to the apartments, especially in warmte sparings - in new windows and in the warmth.
But - primarily, these people will benefit from those who sign the agreements on the exhibition.
The architects saw a - to the office also belongs to a child garden
The Building Aviopoint in Brno is the new seat of the Arch.Design company.
But who would already expect a mini-kind garden here, with everything that belongs to: color-friendly walls, creative mobs, a lot of game tools and even a mini-play place on the outside.
This child garden has been available to the workers of Arch.Design since last year.
The projection and architectural office Arch.Design, from which a series of branded buildings belonged to, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the spaces for his business mining gardens.
In wise prospects, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are in babyboom age and the company is placed to return project antennes and architects as quickly as possible to their workplace.
With the possibility to work reduced, the child garden is another bonus, the Arch.Design has offered his employees in the concept of their social programme.
The building engineers and architectins have so easier to bring their responsible professionals and the children's cares under a hot.
The mini-kind garden is an original idea of the workers (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management, the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social for their projects.
The professional minor garden is financed by the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the State Budget of the Republic of Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (expenditure of 2.8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and compensation could be granted, and for the duration of 2 years it is provided for quality staff and operation.
After the creation of aid (2 years) the Arch.Design is obligation to continue to operate the Minikinder Garden for 3 years on its own costs.
The preparation of this project took a whole year of appeal, while the Economy Rating Society made effective assistance in the implementation of the application.
In order to care the children very carefully for the qualities of personal - a nurse and a child garden teacher, children can visit children without older restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kind garden, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but they change the day over several children.
The child garden management is flexible to the needs of parents, children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the child garden - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is a individual education and career, the programme content in the mini-kind garden is comparable to the pre-school programme.
Children are not only playing here, especially they are offered outlined education - from basic knowledge to pre-school, and they also learn English.
The class room is not only with games and creative games, but also equipped with a computer that is available to children.
More - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can at any time cast a cut on the children and thus lose the stress when the children are late from a far away child garden.
Parents therefore use their worktime more productively.
There is no wonder that there are also natural and loyal employees' relations.
Arch.Design included the Czech companies that provide clear benefits in the advertising of new employees, family friendly and strengthening their personal marketing through such programmes.
A bone house is also fascinated after 100 years. See the interests of Gaudi
The dach encourages the back of a prehistoric egg, the steps such as the wheel column of a dinosaurier and the balconies are risened fish pillars.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catholic Architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house with its organic forms received the name of the "home of bone".
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stone, cockles and mosaics, which weigh fascinating fasades and all-like lines, all these are typical characteristics for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The fasade of the house is playing with dreaming lines, natural colors and textures that refer to nature and life.
Only in a more precise view, it is noted that everything is dominated by geometries, rhythms and transparent orders.
In the night, the whole fasade still works plastic, dramatic and the special light is still strengthening the G′ of the colors.
The same swimming lines and broken forms also govern the inside of the house.
Well-formed wood copys the window frames, lands, gates of doors, even gucklocks and performances.
The house Batlló in the fourth Emple at the acquire strategy of the acquired Passeig de Gracia No 43 was created by the rebuilding of a house from 1877, executing the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the well-hearted industrial Josep Batlló, was originally on the exhibition of the old and building of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís on an unusual and even more balanced construction.
But the Miets House Casa Batlló did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He's with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Just on his throat, the decoration for the representative apartment of the reality owner and also the use of Mosaic on the Fasade was his idea.
However, in the form of the fassade, many other artists and artists have also been joined.
The joint work on the drafts of Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
Thus Jujol also participated in the building of Gaudís house Casa Milá in Park Güell, where there are other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion, the house received from the inhabitants of his organic forms because of the name of the "noose house".
Others again called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "like house".
It is also said that all the top of the building is the deepest of the holy george, the patron of Catalonia.
But also other images of elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique centralization system for the time of the day with dilution channels and typical stones.
Something weird moves her 45-grady neighborhood.
In the case of creation, Gaudí ignored consequently consequently all the building rules that were at the time and did not allow them to be wronged.
Although before the building beginning, he took from the city the relevant building authorisation, but the information made by him about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the citizens were so disappointed by the result that they requested deficiency two years later in the completion.
The Council's heroes also insisted that the building with his arrows would even intervene in the public citizenship.
However, there was no more changes, in contrast - only five days after the request of the city quarter, Josep Batlló made a request to authorize the release of the two highest stocks of the house - and it was immediately granted to him.
The owner himself entered the lower etags.
In the gallery in the second Stock, there was a company salon, in the chair the rooms and rooms of the apartment.
The earthquake was scared of a juwely business.
The entire six-scale building runs a step up to the beast race.
By the basic elements of the construction, all right angles and lines were removed and replaced by bodies and walls.
But Gaudí also with a modern concept of mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be fully connected by the opening of salons, and thus a larger company could be able to stumble, without delaying a certain intimity in more confidential talks.
The house was also obtained by Gaudís rebuilding other than a new fashion, a very unusual dach and two other stomach works.
It is also impressive to Gaudís game with light, as well as the blue and white glassed bottles, with which the inner hof is dressed and the light hair.
The game of these two colours provides all the ethics of the house a maximum light.
In this way, he made the Prince useful that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight in contrast.
The Casa Batlló house, which was recorded in 2005 in the worlderbe list of Unesco, can visit everyone today.
In the first hall, the most famous and famous apartment of the public is made available.
The householders only decided to take this step in the year and this from the beginning of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a very unfair business, the visits were held, and they were also focused on other common and the coastal rooms, and the race of the daughters.
However, the price for the construction time is not a paper steel, which is 16,50 euros, students, rentals, groups and inhibitors of tourist evidence is 20% reduction.
This amount exceeds the income prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Whoever wants to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon towers should try to close friendship with one of the residents and visit him home.
The right matrix and the right bed root? Women have other desires than men
Not the greatest beds, but the quality of the lying area - so matrace and rose makes the bed out.
However, these must be added harmoniously in order to be justified by the specific user's desires.
In the selection, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the health status and not the sex of the sleeper.
It is also important to the inside in which matrace and rose have been subjected.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where it is not regularly registered, latex matrates are not suitable because they need much more to be "warm".
In addition, they are clearly more difficult than usual polyurethan matrices.
And - they should be acquired regularly.
If they do not have enough solvency channels in the kernel and are still located on a fixed plate, futility occurs: So it is not excluded that it is formed under its shimmels.
Of course, the choice also plays a role of what you are used to.
Who was longer in the foreign, where very high matrates are usual with wheat, it will be difficult to be used to a low matrace with hard surface.
"When all Eishockey players who returned from the NHL, I'm sorry that they can't sleep right here."
"For their shaded sculptures, freshnesses, and shops, they simply need a wheat from Visco-shaum (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I also recommend that sugar patients suffer under the nervous system, so that they can receive the "inform" from the genetic and skin badly," says Sylva Hadamčikovova, which is specialized on polster mobles.
Therefore, many eishockey players have been given many years ago, but also other customers have provided these mattres with Visco-shaum (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no problem, because such matraces offer the manufacturer Tempure, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech Manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't need to be a famous Eishockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco-Sha.
This "wonder" works very easy.
The shadow optimizes his herd and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise it regularly affects the heat body.
Nowhere, in the night, you don't go around like a serious battle.
You're just sleeping much better.
Furthermore, the viskoelatic shadow offers protection from decubitus (water fire).
When choosing the size of the mattrate, the length of the footshals should still be calculated for the body size, so about 21 to 34 cm.
Man like a woman who is big at the 180 cm needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should be available at least 90 cm width, so 180 cm together.
In individual beds, for example in Singles, 120 to 140 cm are placed.
Half of the comfort and also for possible spectators.
Otherwise, the following rules apply to the ideal width of beds: "If you are on your back, it should still be enough space for the easily wrapped arms," advised Ing. Helena Prokopová, the Dunchmaster of the Polsters and Spaumusstatters, which has been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and the engineology of mobiles, and also provides this topic on experts.
At a double bed, everyone needed a own rose and his own matrace, but care for the purchase, so that the matraches are equal to high.
Otherwise, there is nothing else left than mounting the roses in different heights and it is not longer possible for any trailing.
Shadow matrates should be at least 14 cm high, feed-screen matrices with 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should cover the form and the fine pole.
"By the hand or by adjustment, you can not find the feeds in any case," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each matrix makes a special wheat type necessary.
The entirely filled beds with matrats and substrates as a group of siamzwillings have nothing to look for in the bed room.
These matrates can't blow up and the reference can't wash what is already running and giving today.
And as you lose in one night between 0.2 to 0.75 l swimming, it is clear that the matratz after five to seven years will be slow to a large (and hidden sieb).
Furthermore, experts refuse advertising, who promised a lifelong duration of up to 25 years in matrates, even long-term guarantee.
Everything's got her "Apple" and "Aper".
And therefore, a practical advice from the traders: In matrices of 120 or 140 cm width, the hygiene of the washable, distractable, but it is recommended to use a matracy shone that can be easily cut off and wash.
Even if matrate rounds are usually produced today, so that after opening two halfs (increasingly important for washing and washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger matrates, especially on the same side, is often like the inequality battle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a rose?
Get out of here!
Or at least for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
Moreover, they should raise the plate with flashing lowers (if there are no inside) and use fats with feed skelets and 15 cm minded hooks with sog. coppers and fibre pools.
Polyurethan matrices are not part of such a substrate.
For latests with 14 to 18 feed bars (lamelets) are suitable for latex or sandwich matrates (i.e. also combined from Latex and Kokos), they always covered the roses with a larger number of lattes, so 28 and more feed bars, with Lordosen in the lending area and the possibility of regulating the latest hard.
The lame roots do not belong to matraches with Federskelett because they do not respond to the ergonomic imagination.
Besides the setting of the feed bars, special flexible scroll modules are also offered.
This is a special strengthening of the feed bars that allows the pressure of the feed bars or to prevent them from allowing the pointing incidence of the sleeper's walls.
In particular for men with broad sculptures, an important thing.
There are even matracy manufacturers who have started to use wheel zones for the sculpture area.
The ladies are also thinking -- they're looking for these wheat zones in the town.
For the most accused clients, pointelastic flight feed systems (lattoflex) or roses with pointelastic contact paths with sog. multitortion feeding.
The pressure is distributed to several points, reducing the spending.
But - if you use a bad (too big and furious) headbox for the right matrix and right rose, most benefits are lost again.
In addition, there is a rule of fashion: the headbox should lip the head, and its tops should only be set to the rocks so that the rock muscles can relax.
Thus, the ideal appears a 50 x 60 cm of a big kiss, for example, as the scandal river likes.
In the side position, the headbox (compared with the raw or wheel zone in the matratz) should compensate the height of the rock.
Something is common with our modern matrates with the only (with Heu ́tes) electrical sacks.
Modern manufacturers always use more common natural materials or at least their mixtures.
Moreover in matrates, the new tuberculosis calls "Bio".
Instead of olive oil, it is always used to produce polyuretaniums of common natural oil - for example Rizinus and Sojale oil.
Soja is likely used by all manufacturers.
"Bio is called for matrates, which constitutes its core of materials pure natural origin," Peter Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus states.
However, natural substances are also used in the manufacture of matrate powder - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, microcapsules can also spread fresh forest or lavendel dust when sleeping.
There's also a distinction between husband and woman.
Wonderfully, for men, a "coaler" pf'enextract from bird blacks is used to absorb the heat and coal the body, the respects for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts from red paprikaschots rain the blood circle, so the weaker sex becomes heavy when sleeping.
And the favorites today?
Matrates of cold swimming (he has larger pores with zero cell structure and is therefore more respiratory than commercial polyuretan and much more flexible).
The combination of the various staff (heart) of cold shaves and visco-shaams produces multiple zone matrates that know exactly where the head, the hole and the ferses are.
However, for a high-quality matrice, there are 7000 crowns and more.
However, health measures are usually charged with less value tax, as they are considered as medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was assigned to this benefit.
It's not so easy to save at the matratz and rost.
There are and again special offers of manufacturers and traders, which offer two mattrates to the price of one.
Thus, the Mark Magniflex offers the matratze Duofre with a hidden visco-schaum Me ́ for 11.990 CZK.
The second gets free of it.
It was the material temper that introduced the era of the viskoelastic sharks with open cell structure and high depth in nearly cosmic tempo.
No wonder, they were developed for the NASA because the astronautes are exhausted at the beginning of great overloads.
Tempure is weakened in heat, and in cold environment it is re-fishing.
So it fits the human body perfectly and distributes the body pressure in optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure fire, but it generally increases the comfort of sleep.
Viscoelastic tubes are, however, not only used for matrates but also for other health products, such as for special footpools that should facilitate the feet and the feet.
Inland producers, for example, use Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More parents want human monitoring devices to control the children
The whilst for their own children and thus make more parents watch them via GPS.
The system found originally for car rental can also move good people, which would be helpful in such cases, as recently in the disappearing of the nine-year-old Anic Janatková.
The device is currently as large as a cigarette box but soon it may not be greater than a armband hour.
Humans have made the case of the disappeared ass and fear, and thus keep them on the means and ways of looking for their children better.
Moreover, for the price of an impairment of their attitude.
"We are trying to say to everyone that this is not the case of spionering, but to reduce the probability of tragedy," Peter Pilin from the company Macro Weil, one of the providers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that, in particular, it can come to the misuse of such devices, for example, if you put it into the box to someone without that he knows, but we had no such case before."
"The majority of customers actually buy it out of security," adds Pilin.
See opinion, however, the child should always know what the "shachel" is to serve and how to use it in need.
The child psychologist Dana Bočkova, however, points out that if a child doesn't like such a thing, it's simply dealing with his own.
"And very small children show great creativity when it's about to lose certain things reasonably if they don't want to be controlled."
"When the phones first wake up in the parents' expectations, they can easily disable themselves as well as these new monitoring devices," says Mrs Bočkova.
Your opinion is also restricted whether such an installation in the case of an attack really helps.
"When the Kidnapper is planned, the kidnapper is practically always controlling whether the child has any electronic with it to be addressed."
"This is the phone today."
"If such monitoring devices find greater use, they would also look for them, because their sale would have been securely accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases the criminals of the police are always a step forward," says the psychology.
However, it agrees that similar devices may be helpful in a sudden attack by a child.
According to the RC monitoring company, Roberta Čech offers location services both for cars and for persons, the existence of such devices can also help if it is soon after the attack.
"The device can be set to it that it reports the position in certain interactions."
"And if it would be quickly, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"It is even integrated in the furnishing devices, which means falling and remaining unmountable, send the device immediately a warning under the position indicated," said Mr. Czech.
See views of similar services can also make smart mobile phones with Property, but only a special software is needed.
The problem of the current location devices is that it is either regarding devices in the size of the wooden boxes that are similar to the locks or smaller phones.
It always exists that you lose it.
According to Mr. Pilin from the Macro Weil, there are tests in the present devices that look like normal digital hours.
"This is the advantage that the possible roadman does not need to recognize that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Or he will notice this first after a certain time what the police gives a time-forward," he adds.
Anyway, in which direction the development goes - to armbands or locks, the same technology is always used in the same way as in the vehicle creation.
So the combination from location function using the GPS system (as with the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many tissues that you can change all the Czech Republic but only two years.
The Czech Army has bought 445 kilometers of thickness, burned with snippets.
In the previous year, the Defence Minister had delivered 224 kilometers of zinc to the armies.
It is already encouraged to know that the fighting forces have spent for 225 years.
The problem is only the sustainability of tissues - two, but at least four years.
The army purchased the tissues of the STV Group of the Action Society, etc. for 40 million crowns.
In his motivation for the purchase of this great amount of Zündschnur, the General staff MF DNES answered that the soldiers would consume 60 km/h.
According to the research of armed pyrotechnikers, MF DNES recommended, this statement shows that the whole army should deal with a very intense pyrotechnical training every year - from all the generals and officers of the Army Command, until the secretariat and puzzle women.
Defence Minister Alexander Vondra and Armageddon Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only thus, the significant annual consumption of sixty-six miles of tissues was justified by half-way.
These lengths also correspond to 25.000 Deton.
But these armies would also have been given for more than → years.
However, if the old rule of experts is still applicable to the training of each new professional soldier of two meters of a cup, the army has been created through these new purchases - also under the point of view of the needs of the pioneers and special units - a pleasant forward for the 225 years already taken.
In this context, soldiers of the fast intervention brigade recently complained by the Defence Minister Vondra that they had almost no patrons for hand-feeding weapons, so the shooting of the deficiencies are strongly restricted.
To quiet from the lack of sub-hoses.
"I don't even understand why they buy such innumerable tissues from us."
But this is their final decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we want to meet as traders largely," says the Manager of the STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Defence Minister, based on the acquisition of hundreds of kilometers of Zündschnur, that the army would have been covered by this "munition" for at least a few years.
However, Jan Decky from the STV Group speaks of only a four-year useful duration of the police and armed pyrotechniks.
"In perfect storage, the four years are also possible," is one of them who wants to remain unexpected to not be considered the criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the expiry of the consumer duration, any munition must be based on the test of whether it is still reliable and not the life of the soldiers.
These tests are, however, not unusual, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Defence Ministry is the quantity process for the 445 miles of zinc.
"They cost us sixty Pro less than the late-year delivery of 244 miles", shares the position of the buyers of the Defence Minister.
Only for comparison: Annual consumption of tissues of pirotechniks of the police, the liquidation of munition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brothership has been over 1,500 meters for some years.
And the police always orders just those quantities of these munitions that they can consume before the consumer's duration is expired.
The safety of pyrotechniks is also the possibility of flexible buying more modern and thus reliable tissues.
The Defence Minister has still great problems in the liquidation of ten thousand tonnes of munition from the time of the Warschauer Treaty when the two hundred thousand purchased Czechoslovakian peoples were prepared for their road.
According to Pyrotechnikers, MF DNES, the Czech fighting forces expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers old tissues that she has so "profit" today.
I'm going to see the contacts I've won thanks to the competition.
The severe placement in the "Small Undertakers of the Year" has helped Luka Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the "Small Employer of the Year" competition became Luka Pytloun from Liberec.
His history of success is like a film scenario.
Lucas Pytloun was pleased to travel.
First in the outland, he was aware that there was no reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the discharges of his vacation work in the foreign country and with a bank credit he built a building house with five apartments.
If you remember that he was a student at that time in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous entertainment.
"The Lady Price Quality Relation made me worse and so I tried to do something against it," says Luke Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he left foreign workers.
He immediately invested the whole profit in the house, which he then rebuild steps to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in only seven years of enterprise activity in Liberec, he was able to open four pensions, two silent restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was the fourth hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
In this year, there was another first classic hotel.
"We've just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we've seized our Franchise concept and other interested parties in the Pytloun hotels have already reported," says the undertaking number One from the past year.
"Increasing share of this license return for the operation of hotels, the winning in the competition of "the year's recipient" was just recognized by Mr Pytloun.
The victory has made him more known, so popularity in Liberec and environment.
"The people recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me in the night, and I have to say that it did well," he recalls.
I really recommend that everyone who wants to make something be shared in this competition.
You don't need to win equally, every visibility is good.
He says that he has benefited from the contacts and knowledge until today, otherwise it would not have come to us.
"To some people I have met with the competition, I will discuss regular business relations until today."
The honour related to the successfulness of its opinion is also a little lower to each of his employees.
And there is the seventy.
"I note greater loyalty and proudness to them that they are part of something that will be assigned to the general recognition."
I really view this as not only as a personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just in front of something," Luke said humiliating Pytloun.
My followers, I want a more milder year when we had it in farm.
The victory has been quickly resolved from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal effort, the farm has the worst thing behind.
The price for the first range of the Competition Vodafone Company of the year last year, Karel Žárārský, the company Farmet's company.
At that time, the Jury appreciated the efforts that he made from the small tool building in Cheská Skalice a company from the ground, which makes hundreds of millions of circuits.
"I can say that this appreciation is not only myself but also encouraged all my workers and strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight against the competition," says the winner of the previous year.
At the beginning of the pharmaceutical history, the effort was to do something useful.
And when the State’s father Karel Žárský as compensation for the accused by the communists to offer a small job place to past, he laid not longer, left his car in the company where he was busy, sat and founded with a few of his father's cameras a own company for the production of plastic waters.
Shortly afterward, they began to be able to get on Pf’s oil presses.
They have increased to the largest automatic press manufacturer throughout the Mediterranean.
But only through the success of the competition and its mediation, it has also been aware of the non-publicity.
"Not only that our customers now feel clearly more intense to the Farmet Mark, but also our foreign partners began to cooperate with a company who has made the best possible success in their country to meet greater value," Karel Žžarārsky says.
However, the past year was not only in the sign of the victory.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool-building products.
The crisis that at that time was less than the citizens, but especially the company, just reached its high point - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and to endanger the acquisition of new institutions and technologies.
"We couldn't even escape this situation."
"The ranges went back about 40 Pro, we had to drink the production and even get to release," Karel Žárārský said
A living undertaking must, including, take such irrespective measures.
However, it was possible to get the situation in the face and to keep the company in the black numbers, even if with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to stop - in investment in research and development.
"Out of the extent, we build a research and training area, we strengthen our presentation on international measurements, and make major prices for domestic exhibitions," says Žžárský.
Everything proves that we have overcome the crisis.
The areas grow again and with them also the number of new workers.
"The new winner I want great joy in the victory - but in a lower atmosphere," Karel Gidžársky explains.
A review of opinion that clears the rules for us
The question of the "absurdity of the year" is for the fourth time part of the competition of the undertaking.
Some of our rules have already been created from the world.
As a doubtful winner of the next year of the opinion "Absurdity of the year" the obligation to create documents on the authorities available on the Internet.
Thus, more than one third of not totally four thousand voting undertakings disappeared.
So the social insurance administration requested a paper output from the trade ruler, even if the officer could call him by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the question of opinion, this changes now.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require exemptions from the commerce government in the future in the control of social insurance payers," said the speaker of CSSZ Jana Buranňová.
The meaning and purpose of the question "Absurdity of the Year" is to take all rules and arrangements under the light, to comply with the enterprises in Czechland and to raise us up.
This has already been the fourth part of an undertaking competition which is composed of the economic period (HN) and is pleased in the public.
When the vote was shared in the last year to the three thousand people, there were four thousand in this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that are unique and alone to prevent business activities.
"What for example is the number of income tax forms, we take a previous range in the world," Karel Havlikch notes from the association of small and medium-term businesses and operators of the Republic of Czech Republic.
The simplification of enterprise activity is the publicized goal of all governments in recent years.
However, in comparison to the world, the situation in Czechland has not seen.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic takes the 74th range, compared to the previous year, an eight more bad places.
Competition was first called for the year and played each year after the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic disappointment from April to the end of September to the end of the competition.
In order to log in, the website www.firmaroku.cz follows seeking seven candidates for the "Antiprise" and allows the public to vote on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It seems to the absurdity that the majority of votes are obtained.
For this year's review of opinion, more than 100, more precisely 105 without meaning rules and arrangements have been reported.
The tips are not only from undertakers but also from professional associations and journalists.
For example, among the nominated "finists" of the competition, there are provisions that holding vehicles for carrying and travelling roads have to have a wall or that enterprises with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to be carried out every two years.
The list of "Seven" currently is published on the sides of the competition.
The call for competition at the Prager Wenzels place on the beginning of November is part of a happening, which regularly shares personalities of the political and public life.
In this year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-term companies and business operators of the Republic of Cz.A. and Petr Kužel, the President of the Commerce Chamber of the Republic at the high point of competition with the party.
"Where the State puts a knife between the feet, there is no real economic exciting, therefore it is my goal to set up at least 30 paragraphs each year that are still difficult to enterprises today," shared Martin Kocourek, the Minister for Industrie and Trade.
The efforts to create us from the world show effect.
In 2007, most of the enterprises were committed to report to the officer at the place of their constant operating place three days in the preview of the purpose of carrying out an exhibition status or Kirmes.
This obligation was revoked by the power of a Novelle of the Law.
The obligation that has been received in 2007 by the second largest number of votes - the obligation to report to the Office Service Travels of Employed Workers to up to 30 days - was also rejected by the Law on them. "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
In 2009, it was chosen to have a mirror, a fridge and two person wages in the speaking room.
This Regulation has been mixed by the Ministry of Health in this year in some ways - the obligation to cold injury has fallen.
A new category values socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitary, environmental, educational or sport projects
A newness in this year's fifth year of competition in the Economic Journal (HN) is the category "Conscious Company 2010".
The basic view of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to submit companies that are conscious of the consequences of your enterprise activities on the environment and undertake socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the Mobile Undertaking Vodafon, the caller and guarantee of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
For the first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company, companies were reported to which the success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is extremely inspired and painful enough substance for an independent article.
Although they distinguish the subject of their activity, their efforts have a common designer support and consideration.
This is, for example, about handicaped people, because of personal problems or health of their own employees.
For example, among the four-party finalists from all Czech Republic, the Prager Software Enterprise Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sport teams among their employees, which then participate in numerous tours in different sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Region Pardubice is the Isolit-Bravo company, which is a major fund for handicaped children for seven years.
A paper factory from Podebrady, for example, is concerned about their healthyly disrupted employees, which make 70% of their employees, for which they were approved by the title "The Competitive Company of the Region of Mediterranean"; in the competition of Vodafone Company of the year, it was in the context of this region.
In the region of Olomo, the MiRyz Soft accounting form, which, in addition, introduced a flowing and average of 35 hours a week, reduced working time and this without a proportional loan reduction.
The Jury also honored the fact that the company was primarily involved in Czech producers, supported citizen initiatives in their environment and supported environmental principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible to maintain the effects of our enterprise activity and the environment as less possible," says her business leader Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT Enlogit of the Usti nad Labem region is again located in the health of his employees and thus has created them to all notebooks ergonomic sexes and keyboards, and also encourages them in their occupied homework and uses cartering services offered by a home-sized job.
"In addition, we underline the foundation "Men in Not", which provides concrete assistance to the modern Roma community," says Ondréj Suchý, the representative of the company.
In addition, it is also the A of the purification formula "Praní a cleansing" from the Karlsbader Region, which contributes to their employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We give our employed contributions to the occupation, the workway, the raising of their qualification and the vacation," Joseph Straëcz says from the building Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Marish-Chleans region.
For the category of the year's responsibility firm, all of the districts of the Vodafon Company's competition were automatically reported, which answered the questionnaire's questionnaire submitted by the notice and checked it later until 15 August.
False or incomplete responses in the questionbook have been excluded by the operator from the assessment.
"If the representatives of the legal firms have not answered the questions, they have been excluded from the competition of the "Conscious Company of the Year", in the Vodafone Company's main competition, but therefore they have not been disqualited."
"A separate notice on this competition is not possible because it is only a subcategorie of the main competition company of the year," Karel Goldman states by the Executive Agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Land funds - Police arrests in a public order
In the building of the Soil Fund in pilses, the anti-corruption police had been arrested in the last days.
In this context, the home media enterprise and the real estate trader Luboš G. was carried out by the detectives in the hands.
It was expected to manipulate a directly placed public competition for the development of restitutional claims so that the basic elements offered in the competition would enjoy a particular interested person.
This would have paid Luboš G. for half a million.
"To this time, I can only see that the police is pursuing a person because of the crime of disgusting powers in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the Chief of the Pilsner State Advocate of the Journal "Pravo", can't provide more details about the current investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old undertaking was released from the police.
In the way he could manipulate the public competition, it can only be speculated in view of speculative or mental information.
The speaker of the Soil Fund Lubomir Černá led to the question of Pravo that the police had actually taken arrests in the pilsner near the ground fund and this during a public competition.
"It was about a customer and noticed about one of our employees," she concretized.
According to the public competition, Mrs. Černá had the correct term "Request for the submission of claims to transfer baselines under the ground law" and would be placed in cases where several applicants were interested in the offered baseline.
"These persons offer, in the framework of the request, a significant value of their restitutional claims to be compared by the transfer as the basic value."
"Commonly with the proposed applications, the order of potential purchasers is determined, then the ground fund transfers the baseline to the person with the maximum boat," states the Fund's speaker.
Luboš G. was obviously available to information who had been reported on the request and because he was self-justified, since he had covered a number of restitutional claims, he offered a basic interest to return from the competition.
Obviously against a fat decline.
This would also be a sufficient claim for the reason why he had such a large amount in his arrest.
Luboš G. already had too many contacts in the past.
Thus, he also played a role in the case of the former Board Chairman Václav Sankota, who was penaltyly pursued because he gave in replacement restitutions bases that had already been liked to construction decisions.
At that time, Luboš G., for example, made the grounds that were designed to build public roads, more accurately, in the place where the construction of the travel magazines was planned for the area of Berské pole.
Later, he exchanged these very favorably with the Magistrat against a house directly in the historical center of the city, which exceeded the value of the basic pieces.
At that time, the road had to give a small heart contribution to the building in order not to provide the building by blocking the basic pieces.
The residence of the households increases around hundreds per month
The budgets must not only calculate costs for all energy species since January, but also with water and waste feeds and also grow for remote heat and some places.
Families will have to remove more from the portfolio from January than before.
Electricity will be to 4.6 Pro > teurer, gas at 2% and more, in some cities you will need to get up to a decade more for water supplys and some places to defend the remote heat supplys.
Only the electricity control costs the housing costs more than a few hundred crowns per year.
The costs were reduced by all main suppliers, thus the clear support of electricity production from renewable sources, particularly from photographs.
Although gas is just more moderate, this is exactly when people need to heat mostly and have the highest consumption.
So this is also going to be calculated with some hundred crowns more per year.
Current electricity and gas in the whole Czech Republic becomes higher, and the prices for remote heat from town to city are different.
In particular, price increases are planned in larger places.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové must pay more for remote heat from January to 50 crowns, more than 1000 crowns per year pay families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague renewed 9% of water and waste burdens, and this is because the city increases the infrastructure.
If the seat doesn't change, it's only 6.8 Pro.
However, the price in Prague, compared to the whole Czech Republic, continues to be the lowest.
In the northern tree, where the prices are now the highest, water and waste burdens will increase by 7.4 per.
For example, huge price increases are expected in 140,000 holidays, in which the tax regulation is so far from January.
For example, the CPI Byty apartment company plants in Usti na Labem 2500 apartments, to add the rents from January equal to 100 Pro.
Those who do not agree with this subsidiarity would want the company to be worthlessly interested.
The regular meetings that are still paid in approximately 300,000 apartments today may increase by more than 10 per cent next year.
Czech children drink with telenet and Rum Beer is out - it simply works too slow
Fernet, Rum and Wodka, except a good whisky that you stole the father out of the housebar.
These are the woods which the most often need to be treated by the Czech youths drinking.
No exception are children who have to sleep in the hospital repeatedly.
This results from the experiences of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the inclusion of children's clinical divisions.
"Beer or wine are completely out of it, because it simply takes too long until you're drunk."
"The trend today is clearly hard alcohol," said Pravo Ludék Pelikán, the Chefar of the Child Division in the Mediterranean Hořo clinic.
"Whisky, if it's able to remove the father a bottle from the housebar, and if not, at least telenet or Wodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with Juice, then he doesn't ride so strong," said the Chef.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right.
"The most often it's about telenet or room."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in basic schools."
"The Slibowitz was also a member of the House," Mrs Jurinová called.
Chefar日 Pelikán states that three or four-year-old drinkers in the hospital intake are not long-term exceptional.
Before the clinic in Horo, in which he has been ≥ this year, he was in the pediatries division of the hospital Motol, where the cars were delivered from Nah and remote students.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"His kar begins with 12 years when she was the first time with 3,5 Promille alcohol in the blood and yet in combination with "extase", the Ar described a very serious case.
"He was in the exhibition campaign in Holešo," on any danceparty.
"The interesting was that her mother wasn't surprising that her daughter didn't come home 48 hours," wondered the Chefar.
The lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in opposing their own speakers is one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children.
For a real dependence in the true sense of the word, experts do not say in children.
"Until alcoholism, it is a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all the phenomenon associated with it, and this is not the case for these children."
Those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol are essentially a negative-social background,” said Chefar日 Pelikán.
The speaker of the Hospital Motol, Mrs. Jurinová, has been placed up to mid November about 40 drinking children in the yesterday division for children and youth medicals.
However, only the cases with severe alcohol disturbance that made a hospital residence needed are entered into the statistics.
Drink children who are brought home after ambulant treatment by parents or, where appropriate, by the police shall not be registered.
Besides the cases where children only once extract a flash of shops in the school bank, there are three year-time amplitudes, which are a hundred-periodic leave: Walpurgis night, silvester and the end of the school year.
"It is called for two reasons - either for shock because of bad testimony or for joy on the vacation."
"I have also learned seven drinking children once in the whale's night," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drinking child who is spent the night under their vision is paradoxally better to do than a child who has only to fight with an unappreciate catcher next day.
The head pain on the morning, which causes dehydration and glucose lack, can be exhausted in the hospital with a fluid infusion with glucose and nutrients missing organism.
"They're clearly better to do, because after the " glorious" experience of the evening, they wake up with a good pleasure, without anything to do bad."
"You're just a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán advises, while he's dismissing the patients at least by giving them the costs she'll cost the treatment.
Because transport with the safe car and the night in a acute bed comes well and pleases some thirty thousand crowns.
"He and again I have used this as educational means when I directly predicted the children at the visit what their drinking has done and that it can make sure that they have to work over all the vacations to deserve the money for one such feet," he adds Dr. Pelikan.
See, however, the hospital cases do not follow regress procedures to invite parents to have the costs necessary for the health of the drinking children.
Two training aircraft L-159 first in foreign hand - in Spain
Two easily campaigns L-159 of a total of five who have exchanged the Czech Defence Minister against the Transport Airport Casa C-295M, are held in the Spanish city Sevilla, where the Spanish Flight Manufacturer Casa - EADS is located on Sunday.
It's the first time that the machines of this type are in possession of a foreign army.
In the foreign land, they were only to see at Manovers or Airports.
This is about the flying two-seat version L-159T1, managed by the Czech Army.
The remaining three aircrafts are L-159.
These are still inconservated in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the Omnipol Company - has taken her last week.
When she sends the flights from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek is not yet followed by the speaker of the Defence Minister.
The incoming campaign L-159 has been re-employed from long-term aircrafts, which without further investments and investments from the resort of the Ministry.
"The double-seat L-159T1 has been exchanged in current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the magazine Pravo.
He will conclude that the army will not have to go out without two-seat camping aircrafts, since the Defence Ministry with Aero Vodochody signed a 200-million treaty on the construction of four overflow L-159 to the two-seat version.
A new flight took the army in July, the second will take it until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, the EADS has been binding to implement the campaigns in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"In the Treaty, the EADS company is knife and clearly indicated that the aircraft L-159 is the EADS and that they are to serve for the training of pilots of the NATO countries.
"There is, therefore, a thing of the abstracter, in what way he realizes the thing," Pejschek said.
The economic period (HN) had also reported that the Spanish Government did not interest the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a carrier Casa and the purchase of other flights for 3.5 billion crowns was approved by the Government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
The Defence Ministry had at that time not issued a reckoning procedure, but said directly to the EADS.
The Defence Committee said that this exchange would be subject to the future export of L-159 to the foreign.
The Czech Army purchased Aero 72 machines, from which she only used 24, wanted to express it.
Moreover, the acquisition of Casa's aircraft may also have a more judiciary advantage.
The European Commission complained the Czech Defence Minister at the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken three Casa aircrafts, the last will land at the airport Kbely within four days.
A longer indicator finger than ring finger means a lower risk to disturb cancer
Men whose point fingers are longer than the ring finger, are obviously a lower risk to disturb the prostatacaca.
This is the surprising result of a view that was published midnight by British Journal of Cancer.
This should be associated with the mirror of man's hormone testosteron.
"Our results show that the relative lengths of fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostatactic rabs, especially in men to sixty," explained the medieval of the Ros Eeles, Professor of the Cancer Research Institute at Warwick University.
The finger could also be helped to determine which men should be subjected to a prostatacabry test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors, such as health-related charges, Mrs. Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed more than 1500 patients with prostatacacrybs with her colleagues in Britain, but at the same time 3000 healthy men.
In more than the half of the participants of the area, the pointer of the right hand was less than the ring finger.
For these men, like 19 percent of the men whose ring and indicator fingers were equally long.
However, in men whose finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk was decreased by 33%, in men to sixty by 87%.
The proportion of the lengths of the two diluted fingers, which are already represented in the prenatal age, obviously reflects the different mirrors of sexual hormones that the child was exposed in the mother of birth.
Small testosteron corresponds to a longer indicator finger.
Earlier research showed that the testosteron just accelerates the growth of prostatacacrybs.
Václav Paczes, leader of the Czech Genetic and former president of the Academy of the Societies, said that he would be flexible to him, but he kept the relationship between the length of the finger and the cancer risk until now not for "demonstrated".
Czech in snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like the largest part of Europe, Czechland is also under a snow cut on Thursday morning.
On the roads and roads, the winterservants were in many places the whole night on axis.
The car D5 between 89 and 90 km in direction of Rozvadov is locked by some accidents of Lkws and Pkws because of the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prag.
This said Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Auto Moto Club (UAMK).
At kilometers 91, a LKW was unfortunate, at kilometers 93, two LKWs together, in this accident there are damage.
A few pkws are also in the street tomb.
There are also problems at 185 km from the D1 car in the direction of Prague.
There are two Lkws together, too.
The drivers should walk at the same time behind the brno at 190 kilometers or walk over the brno and rise at 182 kilometers at the place of Kývalka.
There are a miles long stone.
Also on the D11 is a accident and the same in the transport to Prague.
In Prague itself is a few centimeters of dick snow and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns are formed in the cityleil Prosek, also the street Sterboholska is completely hidden.
The safeest medium is the metro in any case.
The roadways are running with delays, for example on the line between carls and peace.
At 8:00 a.m. the Prager Crisenstab will come together.
Even in the railway and on the flight, there are problems.
The Czech State Way had to cancel seven movements due to snow movements.
There are problems, for example, on the Strecke Prag - Kralupy or also Prag - Beroun.
The travellers should be informed of the current situation.
The Airport Ruzinie has been closed since middleweek 11 hours to 5 hours in the morning.
Most of the streets in the South Sea are only higher.
For Vyskov, three side streets are completely unguideable, in the surrounding of Brno are probably snowweights, and in the surrounding of Blansko, you are forced to use snowscreens on some placed streets.
One of the most concerned areas is Výskov.
There are still three roads locked fully: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Sharatice - Milešo.
Moreover, you will need to use snowscreening.
When they become re-effective, they can't be evaluated until now.
In the region of Hodonin, the area of white carpats is observed.
On the roads that can only be stretched from natural protection based with insults, a dick cloud is up to five centimeters.
In Czech Republic, from two to ≥ centimeter newsnee, most of the northern trees - mostly up to 18 centimeters.
In the marine-Chlesh region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
But in Czechland it's slow to stop snow.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
In Afghanistan, the groups have first used a new "intelligent" weapon, which is only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon affects the conflict with the Taliban, and the power relationship to their benefits.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate canon.
Their projects are designed by laser with a security of only a few meters.
The special coss of Kaliber 25 mm, developed for this weapon and containing high-explosive sprinkhane, works practically as small granates.
The shops can be programmed so that they can explode not only when they go to the goal but at any point of their ballistic flights.
That means, you can use it against an enemy who is standing behind an obstacle - a wall or in the snare.
From above, it is usually not sealed, so the murderous steel sticks from above can easily put it outside the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new warfare is the first infantry weapons that make use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier is actually taking the lead: he refers to the goal and sends a laser radius that determines the distance, so he wins a precise visibility point after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he just needs to press.
"Let's say you have 543 m."
"When you go away, the weapon gets up and shoots the choss to the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.

The Concern Fujitsu has a delay in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July Next year, 400 employees will place their workplace from the previous branch building at the Marienbader place in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese Concern Fujitsu has a delay in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the specialized Branchenriese on computer and their holding reported on midweek, in July next year, 400 women and men will be placed on their workplace from the current office building of the marine bathroom in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park, which is a big office complex on the Lions Street in Frankfurter City Department Nederrad.
A speaker of Fujitsu stated that there should be a middle-term 100 other workshops of the concert which have been distributed to the region.
The offer was extremely attractive, and the big room offices in Astro Park were better faced with the work of the employees.
Even in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only a mister.
The responsible business leader Bernd Wagner said, "We found a central position with excellent infrastructure with Frankfurt-Nederrad."
The exciting connection to the aircraft is just for a global company such as Fujitsu of great importance.
The new movement of a major enterprise within the region showed joy in winners and disappointment in losers yesterday.
Frankfurt economic decernant Markus Frank (CDU) said that a global player was won again.
It's a great place notice.
Fujitsu fits the city, the occupation is an important impulse for nederrad.
The Bad Homburger Oberburger Master Michael Korwisi (The Green) suffered the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed early by the business guide on the purpose.
"We have certainly offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts had not been able to change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the inhabitants of the immobility at the marine bathroom.
In fact, economic reasons would have given the exemption.
Now it is to prevent a long space at such a prominent place.
"I hope that the owner and owner of the building appears cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu until now on the road and the neighborhood "Small vertical" belonged to the rest of the buildings at the seabader space ≥ years ago to the most excited buildings of the Kur city.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, there was a new city centre between Bahnhof and Rathaus, which provided both the massive maintenance of areas previously used as a parking place and the height of the buildings for criticism.
2001: The facility and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel systems, start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer at the same time connected to Siemens Fujitsu the homes.
The building used by Fujitsu was built in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilie-Chancen group with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and continued to rebuild the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid for a year later.
Fujitsu consumers in Tokio are the most largest IT providers of the world.
For example, he provides firms and computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The reduction in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees count Fujitsu in München.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiarity of Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Nederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
The Astro Park was mixed 7000 square meters in the burial building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name is playing on its star-formed base-rise - including the central band has its seat.
Amazon locks server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks are still in trouble.
The internet service officer Amazon has forgotten the enth-effect platform from his servers.
There may be a political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomates.
Wikileaks-ground Assange appears to stay in England.
The enth’s Wikileak's enth’s platform is always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their current server and now search for a Internet home in Europe.
The prominent senator Joe Lieberman called in other countries and companies to boykott of Wikileaks.
And the Wikileaks Greener Julian Asange, which is located on the Interpol playlists, will be stopped after a magazine report in Britain.
"Wilileaks deteriorated by Amazon---"
"Free talks in the country of freedoms," the enth-up activists shared Twitter on middle-week (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet undertaking Amazon had forgotten the Wikileaks documents from his servers.
The Internet activists returned to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of secret diplomatic depths to enable high access numbers to documents.
By Twitter, Wikileaks continued to say: "Prima - ours are now issued to employ people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with the freedom of mind, "should they stop driving books."
Amazon has stopped the use of his server by Wikileaks after the workers of Senator Joe Lieberman had performed research, the TV CNN reported in vocation to the Office of Loverman.
The President of the Senate Committee for Home Protection threatened Amazon with a boykott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to take this action earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
That is why loverman urged the platform to deny the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikeleaks' illegal, unweddless and unrespectable action sets our national security on the game and guards around the world's life," it says in a communication of the partial senator.
"No responsible company - either ananic or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to broadcast the coated material."
Wikileaks-Grunner Asange, which is searched by the authorities in Sweden because of administration forbidden, is found in the Interpol's management list.
According to a report of the London magazine "The Indian" the 39-year-old in Britain, which is the exact place of Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always covered research in Sweden as the intrigue of his adversaries.
Wikileaks speaker Christinn Hrafnsson said in London, it has given advantages.
"There was even called after a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why feared assing rightly for his security, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks greener will therefore continue to be hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested the responsibility for the Wikileaks enthings to be accused and charged for the tradition.
In Canada, a Governing Boss Stephen Harper's adviser said - obviously irotic - in television, asange should be killed and Obama could "use a dream".
Thus, between the white house and the ascense, a shift was burned.
The speaker of the president Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "release and absurd" that Asange had requested the reception of foreign minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for the latest requests of spionage to diplomates.
"I'm not sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The Government of the Ananian is now enlarged by the protection of its databases at the level of testing.
As a special officer, the Vice Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Measures, Travers, was appointed, the white house shared.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that were necessary after the publication of the news reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the ways the whole government exchanges and shalts information.
The Government also announced to ensure the security of dissidents and assets, they should be consulted by the Wikileaks publication.
"We have done everything to contact them," said foreign speaker Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to discuss them if it should be necessary."
The Iron University
The "Gelato" in Bologna is prepared for better years.
The three-day basic rate for future gelatiaries has the largest running and sugars throughout the world.
Where comes the whole ice from?
From the latzer and from Gelataio.
The latter, in Germany a little older than the eggs, sets the creme in accordance with all the rules of the Italian railway art.
The Gelataio takes the icecreme out of the coal cool, stretches it into the weapons and then covers it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice does not come to the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Iron University established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that the ice creme from its machines would be justified by the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic rate for future gelatieri has the largest running and sugars from the world.
However, there are also multiday special courses around chocolate and practice in the household iron.
Some dream in the middle-life crisis from a new car, others simply walk on the glace ice of their vague visits.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil over Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, artificial teacher from California, is the slow-food movement and wants to offer a future quality product in the country of the industrial Ice Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business guardian and wants to enter something proper in a nervous work after years.
Two young Egyptians dream about opening a iron in Kairo.
A man from Malta and one of Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice creme in their bars - and the Canadian housewoman Julia comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains to the participant the ideal properties of perfect ice creme.
Decisively, it is not only good pleasure, but also the severe shame and consistency.
But Luciano doesn't forget when he is trained, but he doesn't forget the headquarters of the national and generally southern surface: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still any number of romantics."
The first step to manufacture seems to be simple.
Luciano kips the basic components of milk, sahne, milk pulver, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixed device, which has been hit by a electronic program to 85 degrees and then coaled immediately to four degrees.
Then he turns up the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white basecreme, base for all kinds of milk.
Soon the Do° will be warmed with questions: Can Icecreme only be produced with natural substances without stabilisator?
How can you allow your own experience loss to run free?
Luciano warns about leaving it from the magazine to the mistake.
Who speaks of ice creme "only from natural assets" may even have used stabilisers - mostly a natural product, such as guarbohne meat.
Of course, you can also produce ice without stabilisator, only then it needs to be covered within one day, elsewhere it gets together, and the customer is boring on la日 eiskhorns.
Some varieties at the base mass are allowed.
Spannender is going to be with the aromas.
For the iron grass, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweetnesses of the super.
Moreover, there are powder and pastures.
"The suppliers will all try to rotate your dozens of aromatised additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Anything in the fruitsorbeds with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even at the ice creme from the white base mass, which becomes with eggs to yellow creme and with cacaopulver based on all possible chocolate transfers.
Now the currency participants can be in the ice machines.
Luciano allows it to produce four different species of vanille, chocolate, mokka and hazel iron - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanille aroma or other natural adjustments.
The same experiment will also be subject to fruitage species.
More aromatic substances, more fruit-bearing - pleasant it is not extremely better.
Hasel's ice doesn't necessarily smile if it contains more hazards.
The most popular Kiwi ice is the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilisator.
Only a mixture mixture highlights the swimming of a gelato rightly, says Luciano.
Eish production is a calculation task: If Pfirsich bullets are used with a lot of sugar, the sugar part must be reduced in the basic recept.
For Zitroneneis, an extraportion of sugar is needed.
Luciano draws up a device to determine the sugar content of the vegetable species (Winzer measures the oechsle in the tubemost).
Fortunately, tables make the computer easier.
Iron needs no longer so much physical use as before.
Not only the device for the automatic manufacture of the basic mass.
There is also a device where the complete iron mixture is cool at the same time and is cool at minus temperatures.
All automatication will not remain small pawns.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his colleagues, from above to below, are covered by the over-dimensional stab mixer, without control.
"In any course," said Maestro Luciano, "is only a question of the time until something like this happens."
Doublelight controllers
The ESA related to food is undergone by the industry experimenting with genetic foods.
This proposal is now formulated by the Test Biotech group, which understands as an independent Institute for the assessment of the impact of bio-evaluation.
"It sounds like a deterioration theory, but we have documented it well," said testbiotech chief Christoph then midweek in monkeys.
The leader of the Efsa expert group for geneticly modified pfs, Harry Kuiper, and another efsa expert has been under the Treaty for years.
It is paid by concerts such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has consistently agreed with the EFSA test rules for Geneva and is then criticized in a clear conflict of interest.
The provisions of the EFSA are in the contrast with the position papers of the Illi and thus deal with the manuscript of the industry to be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parm.
It is already the second time that test biotech has caused an interestscoration.
Thus, a high-range efsa manager is the youngest without charges or transitional time to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and has thus changed the pages.
In addition, the Mediterranean Germany (MDR) has recently developed personal connections between controlling EU auditors and industrial obby, which has made the environmental committee as well as EU parliamentaries.
However, the EFSA cannot recognize interest conflicts.
All serious data, including those of the industry as long as they are of higher fabric quality, are reported in a opinion.
The experts who work for the EFSA do not require that they have no contacts with the industry.
They had to open them.
Kuiper is engaged in the United States for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi).
Thisself is a neutral forum for experts, industry and - including to assess risks for bio-evaluation without lobby mandate.
In the matter, independent experts criticize, such as then, that genderly modified pfs are currently allowed without any feeding trial in animals and that the response of gender on environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, makes geneticly modified meat on the field," said then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole genetic test, which does not provide confidential results.
"If you don't find the risks, how can you find them?", then asks heedlessly.
That's how Angelika Hilbeck looks like that.
Since 1994, the expert has researched the genetic technology and has currently been active at the Technical High School Zurich.
The industry is trying to influence or discrete critical societies in this area as in the United States.
That is why there is no longer a researcher who is not cursed with concerts.
It would usually not be critical for companies.
"The industry controls security research," Hillbeck states.
The track of the stones
Uli Gsell also cares about a total of 400 kg.
At the Montague, he was a Stuttgarter Bathroom, the Tuba on his back.
It was Demo.
It's cutting.
The story is: In September the baggers were pressured and began to break a large part of the north flight.
The Stuttgarter World was no longer the same: ten thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion billion depth of the trainhof.
When it came to the building up, a large part of the wing was in dreams.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
́ilsheimer Muschelkalk, a smaller gross stone, confused between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a picturehouer in East Fields, 43 years old.
He's been safe for some of the brokens.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't disappear."
He warms, "A billed and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he told a guy, he shot to the cigaret calm.
What he's gonna do with the brokens, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The track of Stuttgarter Steen leads to a forest in Tubbingen to an ancient Munitions Depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen created his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old acts with old stones.
He bought everyone who's stuck in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would screw to shotter or disappear in the depony," he said in Property, a wooden bowl, one time a guardhouse.
In September he was in the magazine that he covered the rest of the north wheel by the interruptor.
But he's talking to the S-21-G-Nr for a long time.
And he told them he couldn't have anything to do with Abris.
And if it happens, then it is the most reasonable if the stones were used.
About 200 S-21-G ́r took one of the severe squares in the range of 80 kg, the price of 6,50 to 14 euros.
As some, but also in the hope of returning him to a rebuilding.
500 tonnes had covered rounds, 25 large Lkw loads.
About the half is still stored in the woods, which is longer covered.
Garden owner, landscape, householder.
They had come from everywhere and dropped away what coffee rooms and attachments could have.
The Stuttgart stones of the insult have long been converted into "mouerle" or to limitations of crème.
"In fact, this stone is nothing worth," says Rong.
"Don't be the political component."
He ascends into his coastal car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of a large kingdom.
Jura has studied and cancelled, then bioology, then he has been interested in computers and has become stone-handlers.
And stone loved.
40,000 tonnes of stone is stored there.
From all Germany, he's joining his shoes together.
He says he is the largest oldstone operator of the Republic.
It's breathing.
In the snow are artificially stumbled sands.
"They belonged to Dresdner Marienbrücke once," he said.
Elbsandstein, yellow, heat, heat.
"My favorite steel."
It's going through the forest.
He shows on a crowd: red sandstone, former part of the carlsruher bathroomhof.
And go on.
"Soner Travertin."
Once the quarters belonged to the tribe of the Stutt Garden Neckarstadions.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Presidency, Red Granit from the Dom Sankt Blasia, Tuff from the healthbron hospital.
What work, what effort, what switch.
When rounds remember how the stones were thrown up before and moved with simple bottles and oxen cars, it will be fully careful.
"It'd be a scandale if you'd scare something like that."
He hasn't become rich, he hasn't been rocky.
But 14 people are occupied by the stone marketer today, also left up in the wooden stones, a screenhouse, a smied, a glass blender and a garden builder.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the translator.
He's gonna have to go to Köln.
There are also stones to save.
High Potentials Talent Conflict
There's a government of Andrang in the buffet.
16 Students were forced to laugh bread, tomates and sweet.
The Technical University Braunschweig and the Autobuilding Peoples Cars have invited the machine builders and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideaal competition, they will simplify them with VW developers over the car of the future - and all close to the peoples' cars.
In the fight against the most intelligent heads, many companies are in the nearby fight and put, like VW, in cooperation with universities.
Their mission: The best officials can be recruited in the hearing sales as soon as they come to the work and be executed by others.
And because the universities do not show ideas about the performance of their students, you are trying to spare the exceptional talents in practice projects and to guard themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig we're on the car concerts around the talents.
A young lady from the personal department distributes bottle writers, gummies and maps with VW-Logo.
She told the hopeful young people of practical programmes and student jobs and showed them the ways in the concerts.
Nico Zelle from the TU Braunschweig is the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students are in contact with the industry and collect experiences."
"VW can at the same time meet students, look closer to interesting candidates and consider who are working in question."
Such cooperation, such a cell, is not unusual.
Now be that the students are so offensively born.
"The other is the point of focus on the fair project," she says.
The fight against the fresh degrees will be even stronger.
In many branches, enterprises can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
In particular, they need to appreciate and especially to accelerate highly qualified workers.
In particular, the engineering lines are located in an excellent negotiation position.
According to German Engineering VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unemployed in October.
And the so-called engineer happiness will be increased as VDI predictions.
For the KPMG Economic Assessment and Advisory Undertaking, Roman Dy is going to the Talent Jacques.
He organizes upcoming recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern snapshot, where the participants need to find their path based on GPS coordinates.
Eight many promised students want to send the company this way in the next year whor by the United States.
Besides, the participating offices of KPMG can be viewed and met with the company.
Whoever is able to decide in two choices in the preliminary area.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many candidates is in the United States.
When skin and steak around the high potentials at the universities, the sounds of Dy always increase.
"We want to get out of the mass with the race."
"Only a simple seal was too little."
For the Talent Years Dy seems to be accounted.
"We have contact with all participants of a similar action in the last year."
"There are some standing quickly before their end and wanting to complain with us soon," he says.
Besides the direct bullet on the campus, small and medium-state businesses are also classic in professional measurements.
"We're trying to get offsets on experts."
"Access on the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, staff leader of Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
The Bonner company works around 1500 employees in Germany.
Pubs know about adult problem.
Currently, 35 posts have been published on the business website.
"It's just very hard to occupy vacant positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is the contact about the university professionals.
Solarworld cooperates with various high schools, such as University in Freeberg.
"Professors give evidence that you can make practices with us or write his diplomatic work."
Teure advertising is not indicated in solar specialists.
This is why the company is trying to make other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"It can't offer a large concern often," says personal leader Stübe.
Finance is not longer playing the main role in job searching.
Flexible worktimes, children's maintenance, or > Advanced opportunities are other decisions.
Solarworld was the 55th place under the 100 best employees of Germany in a large place to Work Institute.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employees.
In this way, it asks employees how they are satisfied with their work and their job area and looks at the conditions for employees.
Staff leader is also expected to place additional points in the workers.
"I think the applicant is particularly looking at external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Re日 Warler from the German Employer Branding Academy consults companies who want to build a good call as employee with a long-term term.
He advises his customers to more authenticity.
And that means, according to warler, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make a worker attractive leads to its own workers," he says.
In Branchenjargon, the internal employee Branding is called, so worker marking training within its own staff.
"Too many employees are the best newspapers."
If you treat his people well and identify them with the company, they would be able to throw from alone to friends and knowns for their employees.
"It's like a game with bands," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil coatings
Before the coast of the United States of Florida in Mexico Golf, there will be no new oil bearings in the next years.
A relevant prohibition has been adopted by the government in Washington, and so that it has finally revoked its former plans.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new bottles are in the first place.
This shared the internal minister Ken Salazar in the midweek.
The explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" platform is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" for the strike prohibition, which will be applied at least for the next five years.
Before the accident that elf workers costed the life and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signed on the pressure of the opposition and the industry to allow new barriers in the part of the Golf of Mexico.
In order to reduce the dependency of the United States of oil supply from the foreign country.
Whoever carries the responsibility for the caught oilest in the Golf is not concluded until today.
In the center of the criticism, the British Energy Concern BP is confronted with billion requirements.
A investigation committee in Obamas' mandate shall present its results during December.
In October, the internal minister Ken Salazar revoked the bourging staff after the explosion.
At the end, various oil concerns had submitted requests for new bubbles.
With increasing controls and stricter security rules, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
Currently, the competent control staff, which was in charge of a number of corruption projects, is fundamentally reformed.
Parallelly, Obama announced to closure lucrative tax slips for the oil and gas concerns.
The industry now warns publicly that the amount of aid in the golf would be clearly lower than before.
"The Government's plans are the largest breaming for the growth of oil and gas industry," the result of the current broadcasting investigation by the BDO adviser form - even before the middleweek's breakdown.
The American Energy Alliance also regrets the uncertainty in the branch: "No one knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investment in new support projects would be replaced by the growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oilbron, it ries like in the tank place: billions of litres of oil running oil have decreased the nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from deep steel, corruption and illegal oil cook.
Celestine Akpobari thinks good.
"Don't turn away," the ecoactivist stresses the journalists: "You're going to get enough oil lamps before the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the trial to explain a young boy who are in the water to the breast with his surroundings: In the rainbow waters, the scene is almost beautiful.
It is not to see that it is breast-feeded oil weeping under the surface.
Earlier, they collected garnels here, told Esther Badom at the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the weapons that flee, are perfectly dead.
Five years ago, a rained road guide Unmengen Roh oil in the great fucking area.
Fisheries from the nearby Bodo place must now take six hours to get into fishing weapons: the Ogoniland in the heart of the Nigerdelta is one of the worst regions of the world.
On the road through the fluid flows through mangrove pumps, the entire dimension of the destruction will appear.
Instead of light water, the engine ship whispers brune breads, who touchs his hand into the water, drags out oil fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees are like black lacrist stones from the ground, making the palms that are simplifying their weeds.
Bird heat, such as they are usually in fucking areas, is to be forgiven: Once the outside border is weakened, it is spread out in the former paradise quiet as a tank place.
"What is here is the environmental war management," Celestine Akpobari window says: "We live in constant health."
The war comparison is drawn up.
Ogoni's seat area is a battle field running for years: here the first explorators from Europe were introduced over 60 years ago, here organized in the 80s with the successful writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first opposite, here the Shell Concern 1993 had to set its production because it was added to its oil worker.
Today, the company has been decreased back to Ogoniland: Currently from the whole deltar region from the three-fold size of Switzerland with more than 5000 bourse sources and 7000 km road guides daily are pumped more than two million fats of black gold, the oil fields in Ogoniland are too instable for the concern.
All a couple of hundred meters raise stumbler apparatus such as strange sculptures from the water: "Christian trees" are called the heads of the bullocks too rarly.
They are up to 50 years old, most of which are corroborated up to the market.
Anyway, a bowhead of such a bow is broken up again, says Akpobari, then a constant roh oil runs into the water.
More than two billion litres, after expert assessments in 50 years, the ecosystem of Delta is released: Yearly the amount of oil, as they have done in the Hae of the Supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea before Alaska - one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Whoever is responsible for the persistent eco-GAU will be responsible for it.
With the currency of the Shell Concern Sabotage and the organized oil steel for more than 90% of the pollution, the environment sees more deep bowling heads and nice pipelines as the main causer.
Shell sets essentially lower security standards in Nigeria than usually in the world, the U.S. scientist Richard Stee presented to the concert 2008: Only the rate of defects to guides is "for a simple place".
On a place that looks like a leaven, oil-shaped workplace under free heaven, weighs out of the mangrove forms: they are splitted and scarmed up to the neck.
Under one of the many feet that are partly connected to R, partially spread in the territory, a fire flakes: a illegal small raffiny.
In fact, the roh oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, the gasoline drives through the roh into the beginning top, then throwings out at the end of the cherosin management and s. Diel.
Thus Michael and four employees each day produce up to four feet Diesel to 300 litres: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22.
The delta residents use the chronic deficiency in the largest Oil State of Black Africa.
Nigeria's only one raffiny.
The laughing price of almost 40 euro cents per liter can still offer the illegal cookers: because they get their hazards otherwise.
It comes from "Bunkers", who browse the pipeline network and cross the Ogoniland: In this way, experts in the whole Nigerdelta lose at least 16 million litres of roh oil every day.
However, only a small part of the provisional intermediate hazard is illegally distributed: the share of lions fills organised criminal networks, which also include more and high-range military, in tank chiefs and decreases it in the world.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster is eligible to the environmental areas of the population or the lax production method, the activist Akpobari is academic.
"If the Oil Society had not been taken as intriguers and hadn't severed the foundation of fishermen's life, there would be no Sabbaths or Deb and illegal raffinies."
Meanwhile, the relationship of Ogoni is especially to Shell, but it is too difficult that only a decline of the concert is to ask: "It may be that other nationalities like the Chinese are better exposed."

"The maximum time you're going away," says the muscle oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil deliverers are obtained by the special unit of the fighting forces, they are not threatened by arrest, but a painful painful money.
Moreover, the soldiers from the north of the country - like all Nigerian - want to benefit from the basic substance.
"This fucking thing has brought our country to the dog in every sense," says Akpobari.
Explorer discover annual building errors in A380 drivers
The A380 is obvious to have a huge security problem.
Explorers have discovered a potential building failure in the study of a non-landed machine that could lead to a "catastrophal drive outcome".
The Qantas Fluglinie wants to accuse the engine manufacturer now.
The passengers of the not-landed Quantas Airbus, once in November, have apparently had much more happiness than so far: the Australian air security stakeholder has found a great security problem in their investigations in the works of some A380 machines - and now warns about a possible building error.
The potential defect would have severe consequences: in the case of an oilwater binding, he could create risks of disturbance and leaks, it referred to in a opinion of the Authority of ATSB published on Thursday.
This could lead to "a catastrophal trip outcome".
Involved by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircrafts of the A380 roads.
There is the Qantas Airbus, who had to notland in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian flight company has now initiated legal steps against the British Turbine producer.
It introduced a claim in a Australian Federal Court of Justice in Sydney, which allows him further legal measures against the company.
Chief Qantas Alan Joyce said that his flight company would require a damage for the middle case on the beginning of November.
At the brand of the engine, parts were solved and protected the trags.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause for damage.
After the interruption, up to 40 triggers have to be changed worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced to perform further safety tests to the superjumbos equipped with the vehicles concerned.
The security order is the result of a cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The security problem has been considered sufficiently important to inform all those concerned.
After the Qantas machine landing, the flight company held its A380 floats for weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left about three of his eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
The airhansa changed the driver at a A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-speaking fìrer is the most passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall lè Vershaos
Germany completely in white: About the night, nearly all the country falls snow.
In many streets, chaos, moves and flights fall.
At least three people died in car accidents.
The winter frozens Germany: At the necessary temperatures, almost the whole Republic is accessed on Thursday - which leads to a great number of places.
In the north and east, partly 15 centimeters of dick snow.
On several roads and many roads, the depth is strongly restricted.
At the A7 in Flensburg, the winter service was at the duration of the winter, but it was not completed with the constantly renewed snow.
Moreover, heavy birds were made over the East Coasts.
The federal office for marine chief and hydrography (BSH) is expected at the East Coast of Schleswig-Holsteins from the early morning of storm flows with water residues of 1,2 metres above the normal level.
In Sachsen, the snow moves on the cars and travels led to major problems.
According to the unweather centeral meteodia, in Sachsian Switzerland, the alarm level was violated - the highest level at all.
Partly, there was 30 centimeters of snow, fresh and strong winds for disorders.
There remained a number of wages and cars in the night.
Moreover, in Sachsen-Anhalt, the police officers reported big sights on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to a stomaching depth and dust.
In Thüringen, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snow cases.
According to German train, there are significant sights in Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt, Thüringen and North Bayerns.
Snow on the glasses, rounded trees on the shields or snippets and weights are the main problems.
In Sachsen, the remote transport from Leipzig to Nürnberg was required.
In the Turkish hall field, a ICE after München had to stop his journey.
The 165 passengers were provided by firewaters and salvation assistants with wool covering, eating and drinking in the train.
Snowwinds walked over the streets.
On large German airports, the snowwinds lead to numerous flight outfalls.
In München, a speaker of the airport center has already been reported some cancellations.
In Frankfurt, 40 flights have already been shooted according to a Fraport speaker.
The winter service is at the duration.
Although only few passengers are broken at the airport, they are still prepared for some 400 field beds.
On many roads, it has already come to accidents at the middle of the weekend.
On the evening, a Lkw farmer met a train on a travel to Ostholstein came to life.
The lawyer was easily hurt.
Near Nürnberg, there was a similar accident due to snow covered roads: a cargo was also found on a travel transition because the vehicle stayed.
The driver came to life.
In the train, four passengers were hurt - the streak of Bayreuth to Nürnberg was locked until the morning.
Moreover, a 30-year-old woman died after she had overcome her car at Aschaffenburg on a glass road.
However, a message has the meteorologists: how much the snow will still be lower and pulverous, and thus it will be in the light boys.
But the wind's going to slow down.
Only the East Sea is visited by fast and swimming winds.
However, it remains very cold - opposite to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for his twilling stuff
The German Bank wants to separate from its signs: According to a journal report, the money house is looking for the two office towers at its main seat of Frankfurt.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the real estate.
First, the German Bank has made its concerning seat beautiful: the banks in Frankfurt's quarter of banks have been modernised; among other things, the banks returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial concern will clearly recover the costs for renovation - and looks for a buyer for the two highhouse, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes in vocation to a speaker.
The reasons for the planned sale were not called the speaker.
"We always check whether it's more meaningful to make or to decrease the real estate and then return," he said.
In this way, the largest credit institution of Germany returns to his company's seat after a short time.
The Bank first took the double turmoil for 272 million euros by investors of a household fund, and then sanated adequately.
The energetic rebuilding is losing the information for approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would make the bank a lot of money.
Branch experts appreciate the value of the tours, inter alia called Greentowers, according to the magazine, to approximately 500 million euros.
If the buildings are re-expressed to a fund in possession of the bank or to an independent investor, it is still open, said the speaker.
Thousands of trials about the dead friend
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the decayed mountains who have been explained after several explosions in a mine for dead.
The bodies were still not able to be hidden because the security stake is still in the disaster chain.
Nearly two weeks ago, in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth, it came to a heavy explosion.
29 mountain workers between 17 and 62 years of age were destroyed in days.
A song was left in the unfortunate ship, but he had not discovered any trace of survivors.
As a result of the high convergence of toxic gas and other explosions, there was no ability to decrease salvation forces from security foundations.
After the second heavy detonation, the authorities and experts were exposed to the fact that there was no survival chance for the friend.
The body could not be hidden until now.
Now the people and friends with a memory of the dead were reminded of the dead.
Ten thousand people were gathered on the southern island in Greymouth in the radiant sunlight.
They're moving for two minutes.
To honor the broken mountains, 29 tables were placed on which the helms, lamps and the names of the friends were to be seen.
Also pictures and personal items, including clothes and surfbretters, found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags were weakened at half mass.
New Zealand had hoped that the mountains would return to the surface "from the depths of the Earth", the New Zealand president John Key said to the participants of the Memorial.
"But they never came home."
He can't end with the death of his son until he saw his body, Law Drew, whose son Zen was cut into the grave.
Besides the President and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial.
In the first explosion on 19 November, mountains of British and South African origin were also deleted.
Saving workers began to remove a fire inside the coal work on the South New Zealand Island.
Once the explosive gas is disturbed, it will be started to cold the lighting temperatures inside the mines, President of the police Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Get up, warriors!
Does Splatter fit for art kino?
The leader Nicolas Winding Reph is running with the fighter epos "Walhalla Rising" old Genre-Grees.
What public may have thought of the Danish governor Nicolas Winding Ref when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A prisoner Wikinger warrior with only one eye (Mad's Mikkelsen) frees himself from his painers and puts his enemies around with almost overhuman forces - it sounds ideal for young men's viewers on searching for bloody action, just because our hero likes to use rabbious killing methods and his enemies have ever traveled the heat out of the living body when he has bad luna.
On the other hand, One, as he is actually called, says the whole movie about no word, and also the other figures may be at least one or two seats or a few qualified death cries.
Otherwise, in the very beautiful mountainland of Scotland, the Wiking world offers the culies for about a thousand years ago.
Ideally better for awakened cineshops with interest in existentialism and very safe camera carriers.
Nice if a movie has several target groups, it only hurts if it excludes each other.
Regisseur Winding Ref is used since his wild and stripped dealer trilogia "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to make his works more humorable to the stream or a little smaller brutality access to the arthouse.
Most artificial kino friends should be scared from the spreading brain mass and the heat.
The Action-Fans dies lately before long-term, when a province of free-interpretable reasons with a group of active Christian missionaries will rise through a ship to Jerusalem and find an everlasting life in Flaute and Nebel before the community appears to come to America and continue to weak there.
There is no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has found no kino delivery and is now only on DVD.
This is especially because of the beautiful images, but also because it is hidden behind the presentious to bleeding fassade a extremely exciting part of the film that has deserved some attention.
This film does not refer to dialogues or a striking action, it's all atmosphere, a film-written fibre room.
And there are no entries for the viewer.
Ref is not like a moment of relaxation and accelerates him with his yellow images and the dark trace-like sound track quite slowly to the wheel, especially with the unfair hate that matches him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blonde boy, who is faithful to the side, keeps something like an innocent, all others are being wrathed.
Most of the unbelieving hero, whose motive never will be explained, but who will at any time become an enemy and temporary associates to warriors from the heavy, perhaps to the messenger of the Devil himself.
It means destruction, but maybe only for those who have been destroyed without it.
"Walhalla Rising" is a racious movie that you can hate and be amazed to trouble, reproach and amazing.
A experience.
Agricultural work
The IAEA related to the Atom Energy has new indications on a secret nuclear programme.
However, the country is expected to take a position - it still allows controls.
On midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I camp aircrafts are engaged in a mysterious, whirlwinded building.
It is at the top of the Euphrates; the next largest city, 30 km away, is Dair as-Saur.
Your name is opened in documents of the International Atom Energy Protector (IAEA) when it is about the reaction that has built the reactions with the help of North Korea in the quarter, hidden in a valley that descends from the electricity.
According to a letter from the US foreign service from the end of April 2008, the responsible reacter in the nearby city El Kibar would also have been adequate to create Pluto, from which atomic weapons were built.
However, for other purposes, the technology does not come from the fifty.
The → led a video presentation with uncharged satellite images.
By computer animation, she introduced where the components of the reaction would be before the Zer , which is a small copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon Atom.
She also presented photos that show the building from the nearby or even the inner room.
The reacter was shortly before the injection, he called it, but he was not yet controlled with burning steels.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it is almost more than at that time, yes, the races were even greater with the time.
The former president of the US George W. Bush in his memories enthusiastically enthusiased that the ≥ before the attack was rightly sure that the reactor in el Kibar built a reaction, but not a few points of detention that there was a "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some secret servants in Europe are more careful and speak only of a "common reaction", even if they believe the "plausable" presentation.
You missed hard evidence, like IAEA.
Asking how sure he was to have a reacter before himself, a high UN diploma responded only lapidar that IAEA had "suficient material to ask questions".
The shot of the "unused military building" of the Syrians, however, made it properly occupied and planned the territory.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team was found under the former Chief Spector O日 Heinonen in el Kibar tracks of Uran, which was produced by humans.
Furthermore, the IAEA received satellite providers from a Member State from time to time directly after the attack that may be more exhaustive than those presented by the Commission.
However, these records are not to be found on the market because the unrecognized contractor - perhaps Israel - has exclusively purchased it.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot forget its reality independently.
Âen has always contributed to never performing a secret atom program or building a reaction.
The Uran came from Israel’s weapons, explained.
However, this showed that IAEA was unlikely to return after the particulate analysis.
Since then, it refuses to discuss it - just as about the satellite images.
Moreover, the controllers refuse a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the trumpets of the broken building.
But Israel also weighs iron.
"We will never comment on this," confirmed the youngest official Prime Minister Ehud Olmert the official position at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been drawn up without outcome since June 2008 and has "continued developing to a serious problem of credibility for the authority", as a high west diploma has occurred at IAEA's seat in Vienna - a severe distortion against the Atom locking weapons contract in the area on which IAEA is waiting.
As a key to progress in the revelation, IAEA is obviously viewing three other institutions that are "in functional connection" with the courageous reaction - and still exist.
The inspectors have not yet opened what facilities it is or what they have or what they can be suspicious.
According to the South German magazine, IAEA will be addressed as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, which will return from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and found a building complex on satellite images in Masyaf, where it is most likely to be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be in or directly near a military point - just with this reason, IAEA's access to the three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent by the United States to protect military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had been observed by a tip of US secret services on the institutions.
The IAEA has indicated, including satellite photos, that between the three and the quarter of the Euphrates material was imported and transferred.
A high west diplomate in Vienna said, at least one of the installations could be "related to fuel production".
But there are "no indications on sensible A ́s", so uran ricing or recycling; processes needed to build atomic weapons.
Anyway, the type of reaction is operated with Uran, which is not sufficient.
However, where the Uran would have come and where the Pluto should be deterrented later for the bomb, these central issues have pleasant disturbances.
It is also unclear whether tremblers that could be valuable tracks were stored at the three places.
As the hundred layer charges had disappeared from the ground, no one would like to have information about where the shout is staying.
The only few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salzmine al-Tibni, which has examined its accuracy as a radioactive stock in 1998, is considered unlikely to be the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had joined her in an analysis of satellite images for the renommated magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
The records from the orbit, however, show that the work at the three suspicious places of land was taken and removed large containers after IAEA had requested access.
This may be a case, but it has not been able to clear the deceit.
It also refers to diplomatic circuits, the IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow any military secrets to be true - only the approach shows how large the interest of inspectors is.
Indes, Kukus also dismissed this proposal.
Having western diplomats in Vienna a year ago, the reacter was yes strictly, so the thing has no high difficulty, has brought about US bootschafter Glyn Davies for some months so called special inspections into the game, one of the hardest means that the Vienna has to carry out controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "a option for which I am open in the future", but he is still awakening.
There is a high risk in this way: for one part, there is a majority of the Governing Council of the IAEA, and some of 35 countries represented there are all other than for a scale.
For others, how to think of a diplomate, "What if they don't find anything?"
Love in Wartimes
Since Angelina Jolie has started working on her unnamed debt in summer, there are difficulties.
The draft book wrote herself, a love history between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian husband.
You don't know anymore about it, but it's enough for injury.
It is hard to think that the woman, a Muslim, loves herself during the Yugoslavia war in her Serbian rebellion.
Bosnian women associations have immediately protested and have been moved to Hungary short-term some rohdays planned in Sarajevo.
Meanwhile, the movie is in Hungary and in post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the Organization of Women War Offers wrote about the UNHCR refugees work at Jolie and requested a meeting with the shower, a Bosnian magazine has now reported - Jolie himself is a newspaper of the United Nations refugee help.
It's not diplomatic - she has offered a meeting in Hungary for weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must be located in Bosnia, like Hasecic.
Love stories in the camps haven't given it, and Joli's attitude towards the victims has delivered her enough about the draft book.
According to the United Nations refugee help, your organization recommended to release Jolie as a newspaper, reported by the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnish Cultural Ministry, which has received reading its draft book, has granted a return approval for Sarajevo after some Hin and Her - it is not clear why Jolie didn't come.
The young woman self claims that she does not pursue political intentions with her movie, has taken a lot of effort in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parts shared.
However, the content remains vague.
This is a second synopsis for the movie in the network, which then sounds quite different: The lovers knew it before war outbreak and meet again when they, a Bosnian muslim, were dragged into a serbish camp where he was guarded.
What, though, sounds significantly different from the variance of the "making victims" in folder slaves.
That Joli's film actually begins before the war - so much is sure.
The pressure on them, so Jolie, is "injust and based on failure information".
Now you can only make the hackers of Hollywood peace: by putting the draft book, as many before, illegally on the network.
Nothing like this.
This evening it's finally running right around for the Irons.
No trace of disappointment.
That is why the home team dominates his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
The fans jul before joy in crachend la• Music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey pub in the South Cork's beef because the players threw tissues over a three-meter distant distance in beerbechers - and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre speech, there are 500 euro victory premiums plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the bierpong world farms in January.
Cian Tanner is a silent type; this screen drink game and the retaining information, which is not really matching.
Yet, the 26-year-old is trying to be amazed to dismiss the question of what the future will bring.
On plan, it is not a game path in Las Vegas, he will lead calls in January in New Zealand.
"I have a lot of feeling about it," he says.
"It's far away from home and I don't have any job there."
Always: His friend is already waiting for him in Auckland - " she had quickly cut off her desire as a event manager, perhaps a sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad perspectives at home, two of the Tanner's three sisters have already searched for their happiness in the foreign.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as a IT broadcast in London.
The boys go: Like the dancers, it looks on the island in many families.
1000,000 Ireans will be left the country in the next time, as the experts of the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015, they even consider 200 000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a hostile loss.
The preliminary previsions are comparable to those under Ireland in the eighteen years.
After a decade of the excitement, which was a great well-being with the Ireans, it is now re-freshing triumph.
In particular, the economic crisis assures the young, well-educated Ireans for which it has just gone up to the hill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was overflow.
In the meantime, three of the women and men are among three and three without work.
In the Irish Times, there are readers of young people who complain, "All goes down in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against more and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last, then, makes the light out."
Jura-Studentin Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future because the government only operates an eyewitness and does not offer the young people a future view.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no way to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her comilitons decline from an unpaid practice to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is it to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is trist and depressive."
In this case, men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to postpone the theme positive.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a messe that offers a roundum service for the subject of work in the foreign.
"For professionals, the work in the foreign is an excellent opportunity to make the first steps on the carrier," says the Manager.
On his website, photos show surfers and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: Work in the foreign is not a galerian service, but also brings freedom and fun.
As it feels to build something elsewhere, Sean O'Donovan knows for a half years.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland now with 15 Irish colleagues on the building in Germany.
In Gelsen Church, they just move up a house.
In January it goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
His home sees O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extra shots to pay the credit for his house at home.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, "when he goes a long time for the first time over the floor of his house.
"I'm deserving money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm as good as I've never been."
He's laughing a little, and he's going through cool rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residence with stumbled gardens, in the input parking big, hot cars.
Along with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros for four years ago - 100 Pro€ financed credit.
"There were foolish times, there were simple money without many questions," he said.
Did he say that it could be worth the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, follows the heavy tea and says, "I have no children I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes, I can start from New."
The building engineer doesn't like the complaint he hears.
"No one needs to hunger - but our situation is not as dramatic as in ancient times here on the island," he says.
"Once working in the foreign, that's not the worst thing that can make -- maybe we're just feeling like Ire."
He laughs and then speaks of Father who has gone to England in the last large economic crisis.
"From seven years he was there again, and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open and just look at the way it's going on with the life wherever.
For a few years of work in London, he has already been behind himself, and why should it not go well in New Zealand for him and his friend?
But there is one thing still that disturbs him in these days: the celebration at 27. birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could be in a life choice party.
"Don't just too many emotions," he says and drinks a bird's bird.
"Life choice, that sounds terrible."
"We'd like to call it a roadparty, totally crazy, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, as the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than the United States.
These results came to the Latino Barometer query, which was conducted in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economyst.
This investigation has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two persons are particularly concerned in the annual investigation of September and October.
First of the vote in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its major institutions.
In many countries in the South America Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy is about 6% w per year since 2002, the number of democraties increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong breakdown last year, it is to recognize such a trend.
However, only the half of the questionnaires in Mexico and Brazil, the most populating countries of the region, are convinced democracy, which reduces the regional average (see graph 2).
Approximately 44% of the questionnaires explained that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, such as the last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government; both values correspond to those in the last year, but show a clear increase in 2003 (17% or 24%).
A year ago, Latin America's economic crisis undergrounds the efforts for more democracy.
This also endured during the world economy crisis is likely that Latin America's countries have experienced only a short phase of recession and have quickly recovered.
Furthermore, the poverty was launched by a stronger social network.
(See reports of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America from 2009, the poverty rates in Latin America only increased lowly and returned by 32% in this year.)
However, from country to country there are strong voting divisions (see graph 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the belief of the separate president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects in a broad advancement thought.
In Mexico and Mediterranean, where the recession was more evident and has increased violence crime, this is less than the case.
First, many questions in Latin America in criminality in their country see a greater problem than in unemployment (see graph 5).
Approximately 31% states that they or a family member have been victims of a crime in the last year, but 38% in the last year have been decreased and have thus reached the lowest position since 1995.
The increased economic efficiency reflects in the increased support of the economy and market economy: approximately 71% of the applicants overregionally indicated that the economy is inappropriate for development, 56% in 2007 (see graph 6).
Approximately 58% claimed that only market economy could make its country progress, compared to 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the Venezuelan questionnaires have kept this view (and 80% are for an economy), although their left president, Hugo Chavez, has found many companies.
Brazil says that 19% of the questionnaires (18% in the last year) have the largest weight in the region followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% in the last year).
In contrast, the questionnaires in Mexico and most Middle-American countries see the most influential country in the United States, in which this role will be taken in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A choice slaughter
No one had expected the walls to be perfect in Haiti on 28 November.
But the facts are overwhelmed by the threats of the electors who were leading to help to the land involving.
Overflow elections, multiple votes, choices in Rinnstein, zero choices and inflations were only a part of the problems.
Elections open with a long time delay.
Haitians, of whom many had become homeless by the earthquake in January, tried to search for a choice.
Some have completely stopped.
A duty-presidency candidate, including some of the mood-speaking leaders, requested the rejection of the elections due to a fatal fraud.
In the whole country there were too many violent protests.
However, Edmond Mulet, the leader of the United Nations mission in Haiti, took the choice "as well in many interests".
According to a precautionary statement of observers of the United States and the Caribbean Community, "they make these irregularities, so seriously they may be, the process is not necessaryly invalid."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral responsible for the unemployed President René Preval and Other candidates, Jude Célestin, will declare the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected choice is made for January.
There's still a hope in the choice.
The two leading opposition candidates, the Rap Music Michel Martelly and the former Lady Mirland Manigat, have returned their initial failure.
If Jude Célestin, who only finds a little or doesn't agree with the electors, explains the voter to the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
As a result of cholera epidemia and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in cells, a small choice share was threatened.
On the election day, many haitians were prevented by lacking organisation of voting.
Shortly before the election, approximately 250,000 evidence needed to choose were not distributed yet.
It's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in rebuilding Haitis.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Secret in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband, Argentina President, Cristina Fernández, learned a wall of Sympathy, which broke up at more than 50% of its rate in 2007. This is the highest value since their choice in 2007.
However, if you help this next year to re-elect, depends on whether the probably grievous Cristina Fernández is more compromise prepared than her devastated husband, her predecessor and political partner Nestor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Nestor Kirchner, who also decreased the economic policy after his wife's choice, often set up budgetary plans that did not fully take account of tax income, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President to issue extra income according to its own income.
On the paper, the Fernández Government lost the majority in the Congress in the last year.
However, the opposition is divided and the death of the Churchner after a heart attack on 27 October led to further needs.
Some regime critics from the range of the rulers of pernalists were behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (which a parliament struck one another, and others accused the Government of Best) the Congress did not decide the budget for 2011.
"I'm not going to discuss it," as the President.
The budget of 2010 is now applicable for the next year, with the chairman's opportunity to pay money on its own funds.
The economy runs warmly: it will probably grow up to 9% in this year.
The official inflation rate, for example, is at 11.1%, but a number of private deficiencies - and loan requirements of tools - takes the value at almost 30%.
Kirchner, who adopted the Office in 2003 when Argentina was shot by economic crisis, explained growth and poverty combating his main objectives, not the decrease of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, dispacted with the sector and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Population INDEC, which would be nice to the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate way?
She called for the economy and the company leaders to talk.
And, according to official statements, payment increases will be limited to 18% in the next year.
The high world prices for Argentina agriculture products have given the economy a strong extent.
However, the inflation underground the growth low by a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps Cristina Fernández would like to re-connect Argentina financially to the world.
In the beginning of this year, the Government concluded an agreement with the investors who had rejected the previous debt of the country in 2001.
Now it seems to be a television agreement with the soldiers from the Paris Club whose debt is about $6,7 billion.
The Churchners always rejected an audit by the IMF, as usually otherwise.
However, in the past month, the Minister of Economics Amado Boudou said that the Fund would provide a new National Consumer Price Index "Technical Support" in the establishment of a new consumer price index. It seems like this was the first step to clean INDEC.
It is not worth whether the television will be politically active after the end of its office, even without support by her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the media, which mostly has enough from the churchnerism.
When the Argentinans return from their summer holiday in March, the wall of the sympathy that they have been faced will be devoted.
If she wants to win another choice, she must decide whether she is quiet and quiet with many political decisions of her husband.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's electors are slowly approaching a closer connection to the festival.
What does Taiwan think of a large brother on the side of the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million electors, which are 70% of all electoral rights, were made to choose citizens and citizens in the five citizens in the citizens, which are valued as a wide evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeou.
With the building of breaching business relations, including a part of free trade agreement, Maself is a symbol of relations with the Festival country, which has made its relationship with China's motherland to the first time since 1949.
But the test has been found, but it's just quick.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) sets three of the five citizens, it did not receive voting majority.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which has a greater independence in Taiwan, had nearly 50% of the votes received by the KMT 45%.
In a presidential choice, this would mean problems for Ma.
Since his choice two years ago, the vote share of his party has fallen about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even entered the town roads with the KMT.
In the currency of the choice, it came to the usual events in Taiwan, such as cargo convoy with crawls, flag-speaking mass trucks and only specially covered dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder trial.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the president of the KMT, held a talk on a KMT candidate at the earlier night of the election,
When a man shot him out of the multitude. Lien was wounded and killed a surrounding viewer.
A stranger is not clear whether the Säme Line wants to kill or strike with the candidate.
The attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, has affected the choice leader of the DPP, and the DPP has put into a bad light, which the KMT has protected more voices.
Maybe China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkablely, the relations with the firm country were not based.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans on social apartments and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanians love their real independence and refuse China's military threat.
For this reason, the MMT does not like to make its relations with the Government in Peking.
However, this time, the DPP also avoids to hurt the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new consciousness that Taiwan's economy without China could not survive.
Ma, on its side, wants to make sure that most Thaiwanians have its Chinese policy.
The Government in Peking will continue to pursue its responsibility to lock Taiwan with economic incentives into the Community.
China sent immediately a shareholder to Taipeh to prepare a meeting for investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants a political integration, but the most important is first.
It is better to wait until the presidential election of 2012.
In the meantime, the DPP has been re-finded.
Two years ago, she was strongly weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat for corruption in prison.
With his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he took care of the absolute independence.
However, under the Tais Regentship, a new generation was developed as a master, and the DPP fights the votes of professionals and young people.
Tsai, as a presidential candidate of the DPP, agreed greatly, such as Su Tseng Chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything to show that she is also able to build close relationships with Peking.
Tsai plans an idea as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this provides free discussions.
Tsai publicly explained that their party offers a "confidential alternative" to Mass rapid approach to China.
Chen seems to be very angry over this change.
From his cell he explained that the DPP candidates would have better done to be on Taiwan's independence.
He even invited the Prague Su to delay the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen mixing, the DPP makes it difficult to choose its possible candidates.
KMT will have to take place a self-analyse.
Mass values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their choice battle without it.
The main foundations for his unpleasantness seem to be unemployment and the further steps between arms and riches.
According to a KMT speaker, he is converted into his cabinet and local installations.
The strong occurrence of the DPP allows Taiwan to limit the renewal.
At the same time, most Thaiwanians see the economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent colonist, "do no longer return."
Grammy nominations: The Jazz Sangerin Esperanza Spalding was surprised in the Newcomer category of the year
If you come on a request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to take place in the ceremonie at the beginning of the 2009 Nobel Price delivery. Now the 26-year Jazz Basistin and singerman were nominated for the present-year gammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding since its "Esperanza" album in the Jazz scene 2008 is already a star, the nomination seems a little unusual. But it corresponds to the gammy rules that a artist may have issued at least three albums before publishing the album, with which he has been published in the wide public.
Your ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is definitely a step forward. And with their forced voice and a good track for Pop, Funk and Latin Music, you can compare rationally with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 comes as Jazz-interpretin in this category of nomination Spaldings.
The "Historycy" album of the Vijay Iyer Trios was also nominated in the categories of instrumental albums, which thus experienced a real success.
The competitors of Iyers belong to "Moody 4B" of the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboarder John Beasley.
Thrombone Shorty, a famous favorite from New Orleans and often guest in HBOs "Treme", was exhibited in the category of the timegenous Jazz, in which otherwise the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber were found.
The Secret Society of the Wild Steampunk Music Darcy James Argue has already been deserving attention in the category of the Great Group. Thus he attacks the Billy Childs Em日 with the Camer-Jazz and the absent Dave Holland and his oct, whose life-album "Pathways" is an example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads to classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53th Grammy Award contain a bunch mix of musicians and composers from all the world.
The list of Michael Daughertys "Deux Ex Machina" is listed for the piano and orchester with five voices, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchester work, with three voices.
Under the nominated connections to South California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphonie No. 4 "Los Angeles". This track was given by the Los Angeles Philharmonikers in order and led up in 2009 in the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The seated composer Avner Dorman in L.A. was also nominated for his mandoline concert.
Classic nominations are divided in 13 categories, by Orchester, Oper, Chor until Solo receipts.
In the classic product category, five artists were nominated in this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classic albums are Bruckner's Symphonia No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concert Building Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony Orchestra" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" before it was given by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.

Dorman's "Mondoline Concert" received a nomination in the instrumentalsolo category with orchester.
The composer from L.A. indicated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specially for the Mandolina Artist Avi Avital, which introduced the concert with the New York Metropolis En日.
"I used sounds from the nearest and many northern African sounds and rhythmen," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.

Moschee in Temecula wins approval of the Planning Committee
The building of a moschee in Temecula found the unique statement of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heavy public hearing.
Critics proposed the project to promote both terrorism and deficiency.
However, according to a statement of the Commission of Middle-Thank, the new religious area corresponds to the local provisions and will become an esthetical category.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday tomorrow.
"As Americans, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice exists."
"There are only few enemies," he adds.
"They're just very sound."
"In this valley lives wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18:00, and the discussions for and against the building of the center were almost at midnight, while the votes were distributed at both sides according to Press Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the website of the magazine.
"There's no America anymore," said a comment.
"It's another plane of the apples, and the freedom statue is dead in the sand."
"America's at the end."
Planned islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, for example near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorisms to the town of New York on 11 September 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Mahmoud Harmoush called for violence.
His community with approximately 135 families le日 for years peacefully in the Riverside County. But they wanted a larger and better place than the store they had met together with a manufacturer for water filtering facilities.
The new, approximately 2.300 m2 large moschee in the Mediterranean style will have two mines and become about 13m high.
It will be found at the approximately 17.500 m2 large base at the Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still make a conviction against the project at the City Council.
Arsen-resident microbe could enable new life forms on earth or anywhere else
The discovery of a foreign kind of bacteria that can live of arsen opens new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although these unusual bacteria discovered here on earth, their view is a sign that a life is even possible without the elements that have been considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to grow either phosphor or arsen."
"It makes it a thing worthwhile, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' life," said Paul C.W. Davies from the Ar _na State et Co- Author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of the magazine Science.
To this end, six main elements were considered vital - carbon, water, steel, oxygen, phosphor and sugar.
However, as the producers discovered, where the bacteria in the Californian Mono Lake is replaced by phosphor by arsen.
"There is a question of what else is possible," said the Co- Author of the report Ariel D. Anbar from the Arına State.
The discovery is an important step in searching for foreign life, which must recognize social life and its forms, as well.
The mirror is covered with microbs found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, where no detail on discovery was given, has made the opportunity too large speculate on the Internet that the report on the discovery of external lives could act.
That's not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms in other planet systems can handle biochemical processes with other elements and that the "standard components" that are absolutely vital are not expected," said Charles Cockell, Professor on Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a new, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures, a element can be replaced by another part," adds the Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe Simon of the NASA Astrobiological Institute, leading the leader, chose the Mono Lake due to the high arsen content.
Since arsen and phosphor are chemically similar, she assumed that microbs, both exhausted, may replace an element by the other.
"The dignity of the arsen is especially that it seems chemically similar to phosphor."
"This causes organisms to be difficult to distinguish a element from the other."
"But the subdivision is so large that arsen works differently than phosphor. It gets into our biochemical system, where it is almost all deteriorated," says Anbar.
The researchers set the GFAJ-1 bacteria with a growing arsenkonation. It fitted and grew.
Although the microb is better in phosphor, but it can also survive in arsen, it shows that a life form based on arsen, of course, can occur, either on the earth or on another planet or moon, which is more frequently on the arsen.
According to Jamie S. Foster, Do ́in for microbiology at the Property of Florida, is the idea that phosphor can be replaced by arsen, not new. But until now there was no working example.
Arsen occurred more frequently in the early years of the earth, says she, so the community has been out of that early life forms have used it.
"This is a reason to assume that life could have developed differently than in the early age of the earth," as Forster, who was not member of Wolf Simon's research team.
Research work was supported by the NASA, the Energy Ministry and the national health staff.
Recent exhibition dog found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibitions dogs that were shot before a belflower motel were found as stated by the Los Angeles County Sheriffs on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, as known as Chevrolet Express-Van in 2006, where the animals were subjected before a Belflower Motel 6 nights, so the authorities' cases.
Two of the dogs were discovered at midweek afternoon, and the last two at midnight, says Steve Whitmore, a speaker of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The message is: the dogs are sure," says Whitmore.
"They're in a state."
"They were returned to their legal owners."
Whitmore did not make accurate information on the foundation of the dogs nor on the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
"We don't want to say that anymore," Whitmore said.
"We're following some tracks."
The dog owners, Christina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for visits on Thursday.
They took their two dogs middle afternoon in a district house in Downey in receipt.
Sheriff's representatives found the car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old road, and Didi, a 10-month-year-old houndin - were stated unforgettable.
However, the Corgis Bunny and Peter, the Rickard and Peek wanted to present on the competition this week in their Japanese owners, remained missing until midnight.
Peek and Rickard, living in Redding, were on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace should participate in competition.
As Peek the Times reported in the middle-week, the other dogs should share in other competitions in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple of dog view to dogs.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard entered the motel.
They often overnight in motels and park their cars before their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer whale, a parson Ter and a Brittany - with in her motel room.
The deep Akitas and Corgis stayed in the car, because it was cooler there.
They left the window a wide range, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their cars on Sunday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promises to everyone who can give a reference to the Corgis a finder wage. The animals were implanted microchips for Implementation.
On Thursday, it wasn't determined whether a finder would be paid.
The lion is rebuilding after the legal authorisation of MGM restructuring
After 18-month turbulences and uncertainties, MGM now finally received green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York concurrence judge blessed the "prepared" believer plan to deal with $5 billion and the 86-year-old enterprise for new films and television shows.
According to the statement on Thursday, the plan fulfils the requirements of the US competition law, so that the restart of MGM under the leading of Gary Barber and Roger Bird tree, the founders of Spyglas Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and bird tree will be presented to something reflected as a leader of business.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to approximately 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will actually enter into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned investment of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
Currently, a consortium of the Investment Bank, which itself imports $75 million, leads to the company. The funding will stand until mid December.
In May 2009, the restructuring of the Moelis & Co started to help the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company leader who had combated income payments for $300 million per year, to solve their financial problems.
In August, the business leader Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ancient CEO at Enron and restructuring expert, which was held by his activity in Crispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve the MGM financial arrangements and to pay more than 140 believers of the Ocean were longer than expected.
After monthly discussions, the parties decided to offer the company to purchase.
However, the auktion was only a few offers and no one wanted to buy the $2 billion requested by the believers.
In the early year of this year, everything began from the beginning of the MGM team with the restructuring plan, which, after monthly debates and internal conflicts, was finally undergone by the believers.
When MGM has officially overcome the concurrence in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive a bonus of several million.
The share for Moelis & Co., which already received $1,2 million, is about $9,5 million.
Cooper, paid for the management of the company a monthly $375.000, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and bird tree planning to restore production at MGM. In this year, it was just one movie and created an annual plan with seven or eight movies to come to the Kinos.
They also plan two films after "The Small Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
This requires a separate facility between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films that will be found under the region of Peter Jackson.
The Investor Carl Icahn, who financed approximately 18% of the MGM Darlehen, tried to make a fusion of the lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can cut a significant lock in your present budget.
A iPad costs as much as five BMX advisers for $99, while the price for a kinect game is about 10 classic spring rows or approximately 48 play-dogs.
But you can buy your present budget.
Recently, I visited three electronic games under $80 three national players - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I realized immediately that Moore's law had entered into force. This year the technology games are more powerful and costs at the same time less than the last year.
And although less new games appear with their own website, it is found on the most largest of this kind, webkinz and Penguin Club, a wideest boat.
There are always more Button-Cell playing games on the market, and many contain reloadable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are pigs, as large as marine wheat that sing a note when you are on their bow.
Once pressing matches a note, you can play a song by multiple pressures.
Many Sing-a-ma-jeigs are singing in Harmonie.
Warning: If you have started with the pressure once, you can't stop anymore.
For a combination and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on Elmo Live technology developed in the last year, the animational puppet offers exchange games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the newly closed scarnier feet with radical blocking, it controls the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as dance teacher, but their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a kid of the 80s, you will be sure to remember Al ́e, one of the first computerized learning games.
Now he is back there (Hasbro/Play School, $40, for children from 3), with a whole number of questions cards that can be able to be a car to a school hour, with a better whale with a car correction function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's artphone, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the most convenient and useful solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games contained are not as educative as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which has been prepared after Leapfrog's first large review of the Leapster roads with a new, better screen.
No of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
iXL of Fisher Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) used for games and eBooks a similar iTunes system, and thanks to the SD card drive can also be viewed family photos.
Too good late. There is still Scrabble Flash ($30 of Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not greater than a strikewood box and have a own LED image screen.
The game is to gather the blocks to words before the time is expiring. It is greatly attached to an improvised literary competition.
Always more games have a kind of online connection.
When you go to the game bar alone, Webkinz and Penguin Club are the most important.
For example, to give your child a online tier in the Penguin club, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) which contains a currency with a secret code.
If you enter the Online Code, your child in the Penguin Store Club receives sufficient credits for two other parts.
This can be rolls or a puffle stoff animal.
The latest head cell-operated microboots, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not greater than the head of your teeth bubble.
The reporter quickly moves to 12 vibriating silicon bens in any direction.
It's fun sending him through an irrgard from the sticks.
And he's keeping some things out.
Our kitchen was fallen and even spent some time in our dog's mouth.
Police rates in China are decreased
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin steps over a city place, checks his nervous subjects and delivers commands with military authority and deep voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's strong guards of the state order, feared and disobeyed for their voluntary races and their hands to violence - to impress the viewers.
"Stay right!"
"Blick out!"
"Show them," he cried to them, "what beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, nearly wake up the teenager's age, with white hands and the same olive wheat jackets and hoses, were straight.
Four black pumps were in line.
Four ordinary tents sat perfectly on the hair holding with blue-white slides.
"For me they look averagely," Mr. Tang notes lowly.
"Models are beautiful."
Many governments have already tried to polylate the picture of China's city inspectors.
In a town, all new applicants must have a high school conclusion.
The province of Guangdong introduced a lighting blue uniform in place of the grains.
Wuhan in Mediterranean replaced violence by Netherstars: Reports reported in 2009, 50 officers looked at the driver until he packed and left the place after a half hours.
Xindu, a village in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image basically.
Since 2003, 13 women have strengthened the state police calls and have been selected specially because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They want to give the gross police a more mild, female aspect.
But, unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would not be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have from this city commands.
That's right, so the critics.
In addition to the police, these officers may apply the state laws only by means of payments or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media show routinely another picture.
In January 2008, the officer in the province of Hubei broke a viewer of death when he filmed her with phone, how they hit a protest against a M.H.C.
In the past year, a training manual of the Pekinger officers was stolen and published on the Internet. It is described in how criminals can be expelled without blood losses.
In this year, a Shanghai's water melon handler follows a number of hands with five officers of brain disorders.
A video game that can be downloaded from the Internet before violence shows training officers in China when an attack on road travellers.
"Chengguan does the Government," lamented the National Journal of China Daily last year, after further conflicts on taktics.
The magazine requested a "truely fundamental cleaning".
Scepticians have the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the Distrik searched for eight female recruits in October by display, a editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only to serve as optical refreshment.
Probably both.
According to position indicators, women from 18 to 22 were searched with good figures and "harmonic faces".
You should be overwhelmed - over 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 pound.
The employment relationship ends with the achievement of the 26th year of life.
According to the officers, women's activities are too stressful for more than 25.
"The most important is her image," an unnamed district officer announced at the nearly government website Rednet.com.
"And the candidates get the job, first depends on their external appearance, how size, weight, faces, etc."
Then the temperature and the "internal qualities".
"Welky Chengguan are like flower waves," he said and added, "but in addition they have other obligations."
Zheng Lihua, a representative of the town management of the District, does not want to commit this description,
but admitted that in China size conditions in position indications for both sex are not unusual.
The same applies to equal faces.
Whether this is equal to the appearance, it is conflicted in China.
But people with disorders or physical exhibitions do not need to be complained.
"We can't use lame or buckling here," says Mr Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patterns on the Baoguang place near a closter, is 22, has apples and a well-formed mouth.
She didn't feel as a sexist that it was so big value to her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with ironic.
Your colleague with the grapes that are 21-year Xu Yang comments, "We have the task to represent the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not deteriorate the short attitude because they had more ambitious car plans than simply switching traders through the streets to prevent them in business case.
Each morning, the streets are covered with approximately twelve road travellers trying to get to the foot or on the road as many breads and tofu courts before they are continued.
"Lord Wang, please leave here."
"We have told you that so often!" said Mr. Xu, a trader who was thrown to the foot, and then had put his nudle kitchen on a road car.
According to the officers, the activity is more monoton than stressing.
"It's almost the same day," says Huang Jing, 20 who studies in free time.
"All Rutine."
One reason is that women's officers are not able to confiscate the goods of the traders, such as their men's colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report their men's representatives.
This should be done before public enemies, which often have been exposed to officials in China.
In this year, hundreds of people of Kunming, the capital city of the province of Yunnan, randalized after cursing the court, Chengguan officers had killed a trademan.
More than a thousand police officers and Chenguan officers were hurt in the night case, 14 government vehicles were converted or stepped into fire.
Xindu remained disappointed by such violences until now.
But injustices are not to be excluded.
Only two blocks remote from the rational Baonguang place, where the women's officers patroled this morning, were gathered over 50 people on a street neck.
Officers have confiscated a motor rad, which is in accordance with the rules on civil growth instead of in a workplace.
The owner cried Zeter and Mordio.
After 15-minute hours, the officers with anxiety face dropped the way to their vehicles and continued with the enginerad and owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the men's trailer, remained back and turned his white names back to stay anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a pure underlying role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
Sometimes we're going ahead.
"May often also physically," Mr Li said nearly.
"The most time people start fighting."
State lawyer will not accuse Senator Ensign
State advocates of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the accusations which, after his business, with an ancient elector and trying to make his husband a lobby activity, were raised against him, the advocates of the Senator in the midweek.
This decision ends the most severe legal project against Senator Ensign, the Republican of Nevada. To the scandale, which was in the country's area, and put his kar'e in charge, he felt as a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns Office, he was "hearly satisfied" on the judgment after the annual investigation.
However, the Ethic Committee of the Senate may have a more distortional punishment.
According to Ensigns advocates, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were established and that there were no further complaints in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to express the case.
The sentence was a surprise for many ethic advocates outside the Ministry of Justice. Your view was evident that the Ensign had missed the lobbying prohibition.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents opened first in October 2009 in New York Times gave an opportunity to believe that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electors, would provide lucrative contracts to buy his weakness over a business with the Hamptons wife of Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was employed as a teacher during a election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to make Hampton work. According to the documents and hearings, he accepted for them according to Hamptons Lobby's position.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensigns Election Team, he had no lobby work for his former employee or the whole senate for a year.
According to Ethic experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were closely friends before the business, was contrary to the prohibition of the road door lobbycracy.
According to the published indies, "the appearance of all appears to be a distortion and the violation of the tourist situations," thus Stanley Brand, a Washingtonian lawyer who has specialized the defence of customers in the government visator.
Since the Ministry of Justice refused to give the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr Brand and other Ethwoods said that the Ministry seemed very carefully to take political accusations after a number of deficiencies persecuted by the media with great interest, the decision to fall in the past year against the former Senator Ted Stevens for the misbehavior of the State lawyer.
State advocates "so apparently terrible," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responses and Ethics in Washington" (a organization whose goal is to combat corruption in the United States Parliaments and Government cities), a group of legal advocates who have made various accusations against Mr. Ensign.
"This is fundamentally that higher government officers can now come out that the laws are not applicable to them," she adds.
Paul Coggins, the Master Defensor of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he received a call for a state lawyer on Monday and another on the next day when he was informed that the Ministry would not be raised a complaint against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns Defensors had cooperated with the state advocates to convince them that the Senator, as his office repeated in a middle-week, had acted in accordance with the law.
Mr Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had submitted to the state advocates.
"I don't want to go into the details between the Ministry of Justice and me, but so much is said: we believe that we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to set out investigations for a separate complaint by the ethical group after which a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensigns parents had been sent to the Hamptons against the federal election law.
The election committee said it had not proved enough that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which supported the senator for a long time, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyists.
A e-mail of December 2008 states that after the company has continued Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Stab, John Lopez, had a discussion with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was in the Internal Ministry for something "appealing".
Mr. Ensign was also delivered with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, at the breakfast and asked the Minister to agree on a meeting in the name of the flight company after this Mr. Hampton has established the lobby work.
When the last year was given information about these businesses for the first time, Mr. Ensign apologize to his electors and gave up his position in the senate, where he had stayed at the fourth place in the region of the Republicans.
After he had not been taken many months, Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was trying to make a time of office in the senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the objective of police investigations, his press speaker Jennifer Cooper, the Senator, hoped that the Ethic Commission should follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and set out its investigations very quickly.
"Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire vocation makes Twitter careful
A half decades of them went out in the rocks in the courtyard.
In the minute, they sent their reports on Twitter about serious witnesses.
At the end, as the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter communications about the process of immorality and bedrooming children in a house opened in fires.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of murdering three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judgment on the death sentence of the jury falls.
However, Mr Hayes' advocates have already submitted requests to the Court, representing the reasons for a vocation, which will be able to make the courts for years.
One of the most provoking reasons is that through the intensive reporting on the process, including using Twitter through median reporters, it has come to a "circus atmosphere" and a so far-speed, immediate translation of upright details, so that the jury has been inappropriately influenced by the public exhibition.
This entry could urge the appointment courts to take care of the question whether new technologies are necessary for new rules in the Court Hall.
"So as I have learned during this process, I think it is really a matter when the introduction of new technologies into the court Hall affects the right of each person to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' main defensor.
The President's judge, Jon C. Blue from the Master Chamber Court, how last week the requests for a short decision and appeal back when he said that the new media would be "contactly controlled" and that there is no evidence that the jury was executed by suffering.
But this was not the last word in this matter.
Since the years, the Court's claims have found that the report on famous and famous cases of a process has made doubts on the fairness of a process.
In his historic decision of 1966, the General Court of Justice of the United States revoked the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who had to kill his wife, and said in his decision that it would have given a "carnevalsatmosphere in the court Hall" due to the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the game "Of the flight" are based on this crime.
Some legal advocates say that judgments, which Mr. Hayes had considered a half centuries later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the ways of communication from the Court Hall, which were still inappropriate in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason for the influence of the new media in processes persecuted by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at the Stanford Law School, who has examined the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said that some appointment courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of a immediate communication from the court Hall could make processes better.
The Twitter issue is only one of the many who represent Mr. Hayes' legal advocates to discuss years and thus delay a sentence.
For example, the defendants claimed that Mr. Hayes could have already been condemned as Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jury by showing them serious tattoo photos during the vote of jury.
Some of the jurymen said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their daughters, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have filled them with abscheu.
Defensors say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge had falsely exchanged a jury that was a critician of the State advocacy and that he had inappropriately exercised pressure on the judgment when he had taken the unusual decision to free the jury over the weekend.
The jury were not isolated.
However, their arguments on the impact of the complemental report on the process may be the most interested in itself.
In a trial campaign that they had submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the messages in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election fight for the Governor's office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the new media would continue to deploy the flames of emotions about the case.
"A such daily advance of the media pipeps, cameras and reporters outside the Court Hall," wrote the advocates, "he had not yet been found in New Haven and maybe not even in the country."
Your focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more prominent than reports that are more slowly refunded is a technic enemy that deteriorates the report on future processes.
However, some legal advocates said that appellation courts would often face the argument, social and technical changes needed adjustment through the courts.
Mr Hayer's legal advocates strengthen this statement.
In their complaint, they focused on the decision of the Master Court of Justice of 1966, where Dr. Sheppard's sentence was revoked due to the reporting and made clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," says she, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can Majesty connect the separator?
After a campaign of shimpforts and negativeness, this week has been broken down a little spectacularity in Washington.
Is it the bond of a real two-party co-operation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the battle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting between President Obama and the tops of the Congress had no interruption in the big issues that were to be taken during the "lame duck session" meeting at the end of a government period where no decisions were taken.
After all that you hear, there was neither a fair debate between two different pages nor a view of their shared responsibility but a empty episode of a partial point collection.
The public meetings of the president's committee on middle-week were civilized, despite the political subdivisions that continue to be between the members.
It appears to be clear that a close interaction has been made to develop a mutual respect that deteriorates the ideological cloud that continues to separate the members of each other.
This is not enough to claim that it is a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - which requires one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise preparation, while trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the electors after renewed war management.
Therefore, the meeting was limited on Saturday himself and its assessment by the participants to a minimum of requests or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep as you could expect a quick change in the atmosphere that had been dominated in the past two years.
Whatever it is about taxes, S.A., health or expectations, both sides are distanced from each other.
Too good late. The election of November Washington has at least voted quickly for a short time.
"No question, the soundfall has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush Government, now for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"It's incredible after elections.
Whales raised partial sufferings that are again dead.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially in those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", the Republicans and the Democrats have no other choice than a solution."
Bush's tax decrees end the year, and no one forgets it.
Both sides want to find a way to keep some or even all, whether it is temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise is to be expected with regard to the increased unemployment payments, even though the Republicans cannot allow it to believe that the favorised tax rates for the rich are refused to support unemployment workers.
After meeting on Tuesday in White House, the optimism was shown that during the "lame duck session" some and at the same time the new START contract can be held in these questions.
However, William Glasston of the Brookings Initiative warns that a close cooperation in the thrilling issues of the lame duck session must not be forced to lead to a permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is called in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of unconformity is likely more likely, even inappropriate.
"When things have been done, these short-term psychology will be killed in conflict," he said.
The winner is also skeptic - and this scepsia is divided by many - leads to true cooperation.
"I see many things happening from today to 2012 as a pre-government, or shadow box, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this are much to do with the creation of the new Republican majority in the white house and with the teeparty electors who served their education.
How the Republican leaders may also be concerned that they are too pokers, they know that they have to try to keep their promises to reduce the states of the Government and to put the health reform outside.
These Parties will already be clear in the first reactions regarding the recommendations of the Commission's De-Commission, which includes a tax reform and the recovery of certain taxes and the reduction of pensionary age and the reduction of State expenditure.
The vice-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, according to their own estimation, so much forced to put the question on the public agenda that they cannot be ignored anymore.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan for an official recommendation and they were very fighting to get close to this number.
The largest opposition is found in the representatives of the Gremium selected, since at least today, in financial matters is only a few playspaces or a little sympathy for compromises.
Galston says two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in the Congress.
The first battle will be located in the form of partial agreements next year when the Republican Obamas demand for State budget, tax and health system, then followed by a stage of two-partial cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is evident that, despite the partiality of the current election, most Americans still want to work together.
If confrontation leads to a sackgase, as has happened in 1995, both parties must take care of the public reaction.
Anyone who is condemned for loss will change the course and have to search for compromise.
This may actually be a optimistic view.
Partiality and polarisation today are greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological cloud between Obama and the Congress Republicans than their time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure example for a substantially larger election in 2012.
This is how many Americans can welcome the advantage that this week will be seen.
However, on both sides it will require much more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that both separate each other.
Transsegured US document portraits Moscow as the port of corruption
The town's control is in the hands of the "Cleptocracy" and it gives part of the costs and the protection money that it collects to the creml. This reported in February the Russian message in a memo.
As the police and the State security service press high protection funds so that they can maintain their deep standard of life in Moscow, it means.
They collect money not only by legitimate business, but also by organized criminal bands.
Each shit of the office - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has approved as "Vertical of the Authority" - takes part of the money that the leader turns up.
The memo sent under the name of John Beyrle to Washington was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow citizen, and it accused him of corruption.
He was devoted by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is almost a evidence that it would have been cleaned at the middle of the time.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who is a building pharma, have always rejected corruption projects over years, and he has won numerous claims against such accusations.
In September he explained to a Russian television sender when he was asked after a documentation, which suggested that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's crazy, it's crazy."
> An incredible number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as the messenger's report is called individuals, it is unhearted that this happens by a diplomate of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Government of Moscow with the criminality has led to some of them as a "gate" and concluded that the government is more like a cleptocrate than a government," as the note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krishna" (a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which mean "Dach" or protectively), which is likely extended by the police, state security (FSB), service supervisor (MVD) and the State lawyer's office as well as by the entire Moscow Government Office.
Experts have discovered a three-level structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is the top place."
"FSB, MVD and the Miliz are on the second level."
"Culet" follows the criminals and criminal inspectors at the bottom.
"This is an incompatible system in which criminal groups in some areas are locked because the city doesn't offer any help."
The report continues to say that the FSB casts money from the largest companies and arrests the police of small businessmen.
One source, named, "declared that Moscow business officers understand that it is best to get protection from MVD and FSB (and not from organised crimes), because they have not only weapons, resources and powers than criminals, but also because they are subjected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs is no longer as as before."
The note notes that while the collection of money is comprehensive, the protection itself will not be very modesty; even those who spend are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not stop find their business very quickly closed - due to one or other adventure.
Medvedev has spoken several times about combating corruption, but at the same time has noticed that he has only made a little progress.
The note of the message contains descriptions of men who with coffees who were probably full of money, go to the creml.
"In the fight against corruption, Medvedev must leave the offices," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert committee recently in an interview.
"But he is part of this office."
"It's not part of the political class because a political class in Russia doesn't exist anymore."
Without any opposition, without a division of the forces, he says corruption is inevitable.
In the country, it is estimated that Russia's corruption costs more than $300 billion per year.
The country is organized to place 154 a newer investigation on global implementation of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparency International (the countries are listed by "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt".
The enthungsing of the memos of the Ananian message, which occurred after Moscow's time later, will be safely resolved mistakes within the Russian Government, even though Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, that it may also be a possibility for the creml to resolve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted to the enth-up that the diplomatics called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that our interaction is a major internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such unethical way, you know."
Khmer Red Veterans forced to confront the past
In a lowly lighted, betoned class room with smuggling and flashing walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School refers to the man who built him to the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Each one here lies Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people," Sung Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge Government, the commander remains in this former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure, and where thousands of ancient soldiers still live.
However, this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge's capital against the government, long-year attachments are requested in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to face public conflict with people who once supported the regime.
In June, the Government distributed a school book that told the history of Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of ancient soldiers.
And in July, a Community tribunal of the United Nations and Cambodja first condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge when he condemned the former leader of the successful Tuol Sleng folter room, Kaing Khek Iev, better than Duch, to 35 years of prison.
With each of these developments, the Khmer Rouge Veteran Alnlong Vengs increased, enhanced their efforts to reintegrate and reintegrate into Cambodia.
"There is still a decline and is still in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, leader of the documentation room of Cambodia, a independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For her life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of the wicked."
"They're splitting their own families."
The Khmer Rouge Government in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, estimatedly 1,7 million people were executed or died from diseases, revision or famine.
When the Vietnamese involving and in 1979 breaking the Pol Pot-Ied government, the rest of the Regime and his military soldiers fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread up until December 1998, when the last movement was disabled, untrusted.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and dschungel of Cambodja, Ta Mok moved to the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990s, when a United Nations peace agreement led to the first democratic elections of the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to go over to the Government, which led to the Chapter of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 by a natural death, and Ta Mok, who did not submit, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in prison of Phnom Penh, where he waited for his process.
When their guests had no longer spent them, the most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the murdering poverty of the rural Cambodia, and many held the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if some few elite of Khmer Rouge's elite officials hold their local government posts because they put their weapons down, the simple soldiers remain poor, unleavened farmers.
"These people have only benefited very little from capitalization," said Sok Lang from the center for justice and reconciliation, which holds public fores in all Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng
"They are enhanced in the Utopic Agricultureology of the Regime."
"They grow up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined himself as a teenager of the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, struggled with an advance Veng before he departed in 1998 to lead a life as a poor traveling builder.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we need to care for ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Court also raised concerns here.
In the beginning of the next year, the Court will try to present Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister.
The mandate of the Court is to condemn the elderly leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the harmful acts, but it is not said whether other acts will be pursued out of these four cases.
This has little gone to slow the oldest in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculators have been held on In Chaem, 64 years of age, which was the District Chef of the Province Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge Government in the latest 1970s.
2007 she told the officers of the documentation room of Cambodja that she led the building of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project where thousands of forced workers died.
On a warm evening, in Chaem, he returned from work on the fields to his woodhouse on a smuggling street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun was long shadow on the dry grass, in Chaem it refused to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the Court had forwarded her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodscha le日 in peace and stability," she said.
"If there are no persecutions anymore, war would be here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was lodged by the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would accuse more suspicious, even though experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodsha must bury a loch and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Kambodsha needs to do to go forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation room.
"Conciliation with the Khmer times means together with the broken parts," he said.
"It's our obligation to set these broken parts together so that everything can understand."
The center created the first school book approved by the Government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-side "History of the Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an attachment to the History Book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages over the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia young people in Anlong Veng know only little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the town's connections to Regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skepticly when he kept the book with home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are misleading because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such opposition makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Lang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are reached after and after the influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still here is a powerful attachment.
Top to the Dangrek Mountains, one of the girls leads overwhelmed and with plastic broken road to a rectangle of black rose, covered with a rose black-dock.
Pol Pots body was burned here after the death of 1998 on a pig.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a phone seller at the road border, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last relaxation, where she's going to put a bush river bananas - in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus is agreed to collect no weaponable uran
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for global security of nuclear materials, the Government of Belarus announced the midweek that there will be no longer a high-sufficient Uran, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was given in a joint statement after a meeting of the Minister for Foreign Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarus Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security box.
The US Government has tried for years to convince white Russia to collect no longer high enough uran and seemed to have reached a harvest last early year.
However, of the US Government, Washington Post told that in the past two months two secret agreements with Belarus were met to remove 187 pounds of weapons of Uran from a white-rush research station.
This prepared the stage for the middle-week convention to remove the material - as a official employer who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the theme, about 500 pounds.
The Agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Safety Guide of 47 N°" from April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next gipfel 2012.
"I was really pleased with the fact that they wanted a seat in the nuclear security box (from 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, said, "a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009, in Prague, to ensure all the pregnant nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US Government has helped six countries to lose their high-sufficient Uran.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A thousand countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Safety Chapter, Wit-Russian President Alexander Lukashenko explained that the nation would never be abandoned their uran.
"How to keep highly sufficient Uran - hundreds of Kilos, which is fundamentally weaponable, and less enough Uran," said Lukehenko at that time.
"It's our raw material... we're not going to make any crazy bombs, and we're not going to cross it to anyone."
"We use it outside for research, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first approach to remove the Uranium Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily radiated, says Of©cell.
It was downloaded into a special train, for which more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and exhaust factory, says Of Papageelle.
The second approach was closed on Monday and was performed according to the officials per flight.
The US government pays for these efforts $14 million, whereas a majority of the money flows in the white-rush research with weakened uran which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and voted to build confidence," which led to the agreement understood by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, who was at the global reduction.
The James Martin Centre for Non-distributive Property estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uran armed, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly added uran in this year.
Belarus wants to resolve its store until 2012, according to the common agreement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been stressed for years, in particular because of Lucechenko's harsh disapproval of human rights.
But the statement from midweek suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues is very welcome to the United States of America and Belarus that a higher respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central subject in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No convictions of the Spanish Government against flights
The Spanish Government had no convictions against the flights with the Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners over the Spanish country to Guantánamo, as shown by a telegram of the US Messenger in Madrid.
This reflects the documents translated by Wikileaks and on the Daily Journal "El País" (per kabel). It is indicated that the former Governing Boss María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested to inform the Spanish government "to prove that foreign aircrafts transferred by Spain are properly monitored."
In June 2006, after publishing a report from the Council of Europe, in which the aid to human rights-related practices in a thousand countries, including Spain, was charged by the former Northern American advocate Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Governing Boss of Justice admitted that the report of the Council "have found Zapatero in the affair" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined, Spain has no compromise against the secret service flights over the Spanish country."
"You just want to be informed," not to be "unprepared", reports Aguirre per kabel.
In addition to the former foreign minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, the rapporteur pointed out that the Spanish Government would "not want to give great attention to this matter, although the Government only has little influence, since they are in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the State lawyer Vicente González understood the message that he would not block the judicial initiatives, the declassi of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Defence Minister on the flight.
"These reports contain no chargeable or sensible information," said the rapporteur after a discussion with the lawyer.
However, the United States were more concerned about the "visual coordination between the Spanish State Lawyer and the German State Advocates" than on the declassi-declassied information of the CNI and the Defence Minister.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts for discrete treatment between governments," Aguirre regrets.
At a breakfast in March 2007, when the United States avocate and the Spanish Internal Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba attended, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are strongly disturbing their independence and doing what they think appropriate," he has given his employees the instructions to avoid "real comments in order to defeat the spending".
The lawyer also expressed his concern on the procedures of the PP in this regard.
"After its general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not be doubted, from an indication that the Government of Zapateros of the United States, which could be expressed as possible human rights violations, tolerated or previously ignored, will be put into account capital, even if these enthousiasms could be negatively affected by the Government of the United States," he pointed out.
The child murderer, she was deceived on the Internet over the "masters" of the motherhood.
The young woman talked about the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in gallic"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Muski Internet.
Under this name, which she leads from small, she holds contact with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The notifications are from 2008.
In order to understand these, it is necessary to know their loved life, which the ABC daily journal rebuild on the basis of the testimony of their family members.
The 30-year-old gallic woman took a relationship with Iván Tuñez, a industrialist.
She held a year.
Shortly after she had resolved her relationship, she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his old man never allowed him to perform a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered another relationship.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Loussame, a neighborhood.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balears to look at work, the young man stayed with her partner, who even joined her for a week after Palma.
But from the contents of their messages, it can be concluded that their relationship with love broke and they separated themselves.
In March 2008, she was alone on Menorca and wrote, "Alberto is very owner and sorcer, because I came to work."
"When I told him this, he found it well, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy for a whole day and not to be free to do what he wants."
Later she calls a message that she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get a address to which I can send the boy to you."
She regrets, "If he doesn't like me to leave the boy with my mother, I'll get him out when I'm back."
In May, she says about the back in her village: "This week I'm going to go, but I'll just stay there until 19th because I have to present me to a job on 20th, if I don't want to lose them."
She says she's taking her firstborn when everything's fine.
"He will be with who he must be, that means with me. I will never leave him again with anyone other than my mother," a doubtful intention when you consider their bad relationship.
There's another mail in July.
When she writes this, it will come out that the boy who came on the island on the 1st month and was probably killed on 10th.
"On the other hand, Caesar is satisfied, otherwise not."
"On the other hand, he is with me and the place he likes a little, but on the other hand he must go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will visit a summary, so I have less feet for the child's lady."
On 17: Reminders and complaints.
"A ridicule of Caesar who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he has sent me some videos to e-mail.
On 30th: "The boy's fine. He's going to a summary to learn catalytic."
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He shoots me money."
On the Internet, in Anime and Mangablogs, there are communications about it.
She even had a own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she named "Muki, the prison layer".
"Terror a la gallega (overscribed)."
The last man who lived with her, a demanded hunter overseer, explains to have a consciousness because he feels guilty.
He can't think that everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was all a parent.
Monica was transferred from the Centre for Justices on Menorca in the province of Palma.
The Defensor of the Defence, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the end of the business, "and she didn't have the intention to add to the small damage."
Nevertheless, earlier, she had been able to drink Caesar in the bathroom and have found his body in a café.
Defence and State Advocate requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular wined 4 seats in the Congress and lost PSC 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona could play a decisive role
According to the significant growth of votes and deputy votes in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing on Parliament's elections, or not, and its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party has achieved in these elections is usually doublely high as those of the elections in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalogue Popular Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this number was only 316.222 in the regional elections in 2006.
On Sunday last, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this increased trend - the result of the transfer of the vote share of the PSC and the binding of the PP election, the PP analysers prognoze that the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 Congress Members in Parliament's elections, while CIA four (the has now 10) and would lose at least 9 Members (from 25).
These claims indicate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the Popular Party, the ERC would lose a member - it now has three - while the ICV holds its members or could win one of them.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date falls with the assembly elections in May 2011. The Popspartie (PP) can also be the tongue in the Waage to prepare the socialist predecessor, even in four provinces and with its majority in the town Council of Barcelona, one of the urban administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
As long as nationalists and the peoples agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists are not able to achieve a majority or to return to their traditional associates (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican Debacle, it is not unrequired that this party will lose its representation in Barcelona community, where it must achieve 5% of its votes.
The PP, however, increased its vote share in the four provinces and could become a decision-making force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to play the main role in Tarragonas conversion, where they were ruled with the PP before the current citizen, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The citizen master, Angel Ros, talks about relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election fight they met several times.
Even in other important places, such as in Badalona, Casteldefels or Reus, the peoples party could have a significant growth.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and stretch the education of lists in many places as possible.
The Catalogue Cell Al Qaida provided thousands of travellers
Except the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven of the police of the Barcelone Police's secret office of Pakistan and the Nigerianians, who were arrested by Thailand, formed the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Movement to Freedom of Tamil Eelam" and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latest was the author of the Attentate in Bombay, which requested 106 deaths - with steps.
The Spanish Internal Minister indicates that these investigations are significantly important, which is so far that it is able to ensure that the "Operation Kampai" has been "deteriorated" throughout the world and "their ability to act".
The researchers concluded that in the two years where the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were older and then to the groups from which the criminal galaxie Al Qaida was combined, so that their "fuckers" could not be punished by the limits of more and more western countries.
The discovered cell is not the only of the dshihadist network that was active in Europe, therefore other police units have been involved in the investigations other than the Thailand research bodies; it is not exclusive that it will come in the EU area in the next days like those who have been carried out in Barcelona on the last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanian Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) was held in Thailand another place in which Pakistanians Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thailand Sirialaya Kijbum were arrested.
They led Bangkok from the cells left in Spain and other countries.
The Catalogue Network - a part of it was destroyed in 2009 - was particularly stolen tourist passes in accordance with the terms of the "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents had to be issued on the name of men of age 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they had not been able to show a visual stamp.
In investigation circuits, there is evidence that there were no connections between the catalogues arrested and the attent in Bombay, although the author of this Attentats was "Laschkar e-Taiba", one of the recipients of Spain and then in Thailand.
However, it should be noted that some days before the attentation of Catalonia from a financial transfer undertaking were sent several thousands, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which later used by the members of the "Commandos", which prepared a final life of 106 people.
The police took an amazing documentation.
PP requests Mas a meeting of tax agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday had the opportunity to present their conditions to support its office as the President of the Generality as a minister of the election, which did not distinguish from those already during the election fight, and to meet the priority of the economic recovery and the delay of regionalist independence agencies, such as a financial balance agreement that the regionalist leader would propose on the top of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catholic Population Party, with the security of Artur Mas, granted her to the 18 members who had won the last Sunday - a number that is more than enough to feel inappropriate. Because the candidate from the citizen-regionist party CU is indicated that at least one of the opposition parties contains the vote at the vote of the vote.
The future covenants that the regionalists want to enter into the coming Parliamentary elections in the Congress depend on a possible entity with the PP. However, the talks that make mass with the rest of the Parties turn to Catalonia.
As regards the PPC Chairman, it calls for the support of the Office's accession to "all talks relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and a agreement on the financial balance between State and the Autonomous Region - like in Basqueland - and even the Chief of Ciu's Parties wants to submit a referendum.
Both political leaders are common to make the building political equipment of the regional administration easier and to discharge the inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on official access to Mas are available from the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will be gathered with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Old Administration confirms that death cases are not caused to "funging measures"
The owners of the old home in Olot do not exclude that their guardian killed over eleven old people
The responsibles of La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday in which they expressed the damage of crime action Joan Vila Dilmés - the guardian who had killed at least 11 old people for whom he was responsible - the establishment had granted.
Joan Sala, the leader of the Old Advocate, was in charge of his lawyer, Joan Cañada, before the court and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsibility (for the death cases), but "the law and our obligation to detain us are forced to become the process and civil detention".
The institution must not only take a social loss of view because it has not determined the criminal acts of the supervisor in time, but now has a high sum of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victim.
Joan Vila Dilmé said that the first crime returned in August 2009 and that he had continued to kill.
The judge ordained the exhaustation of eight body - former patients of the old administration home - because he thought that no Ar's personal investigation of the disorders, but the formalities of their age and diseases were phonely developed.
The leader of La Caritat denied this point around and explained that "the remaining measures could not have been the reason for the events."
La Caritat's legal lawyer also adds that "no indications are given in the law for conduct of a person other than the accused."
The "Dead Angel" already was baptized before yesterday 11 murders and explained that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and killed the second old lady for a half months later.
In this case, he killed with a overdose of insulin, in the subdivision of the first crime, when he had given a mixture of different treatments.
The leader of La Caritat explained that the staff's access to medicines is only difficult to control.
Insulin splits and the cocktail of relief, the carpenter introduced six of nine crimes in order to free the patients with death from their suffering.
However, the results of the lab investigations will be shown whether Vila l' and for his first victims actually chose a less grass death or whether he burned them from inside by giving them a bleaching, as he had done in the meaning of the guest of three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat there is no faith in the statement of the supervisor, not even in the number of murders that could be more. This position is justified by the fact that Vila has made very different statements before the court and that it does not make any sense to change his procedure after eight murders suddenly.
They say that they have been available for this reason and to reveal the riches of these cases of justice.
The European Central Bank's draft burden (BCE)
The investors replied yesterday to the leading of the ECB President Trichet, who warned, "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
The risk impacts of the Euro peripheries countries are dramatic and the actions of the banks are more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can disturb himself and that the euro has not been awarded to points that cause anxiety.
The events of yesterday are typical for a non-equitable market, which is the measure in which it recovers again, however, due to the closement of shorter and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his power for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank invited us to reject our liquidity assets, which the ECB must make tomorrow the fourth time in two years, and probably a few times in the future.
The Federal Bank requested the end of the plan for purchasing State debts, since they are ineffective, and the cancellation of all extraordinaryly periodic liquidity measures, which should only be maintained a weekly unexpected access.
After Ireland's crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to extend "almost until March" and keep the four-year charges with unlimited access to the quarter end to ensure liquidity until June at least.
We also expect that the program to purchase Oblig’s continues and will be issued a stronger signal.
If the created expectations are not fulfilled, the exciting reaction of the markets will be returned from yesterday, and if we endure a long time to return our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Similarly, as at the ECB's session in May, where the Bank confirmed not to take into consideration the purchasing of State debt papers and to assemble the markets, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be reliable and sustainable.
In May, she showed the teeth and the midweek she said that she had already covered a lot, which caused her a new market breakdown.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The State asset management only exposed 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
However, the price rates in Portugal fell about 30 base points in the whole curve and thus reflected a change in the markets in respect of Trichets.
In Ireland the numbers of debt of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum will be estimated at approximately 10 000 million short-term and more 15 000 more possible. There is time until February to gain private capital or to establish these banks.
Although Ireland has completely lost his credibility after it has not recognized the problem with the stress test in July, the numbers are acceptable and helped to reduce the inconscience.
However, the Government must receive Parliamentary approval to a new budget on Saturday, since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of ignorance.
Angela Merkel has made its discourse on the bridge of the heads of the State and the Government moderate on 14 December, where political units are asked to show that we play the same party together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the nineth Sinfonie Beethovens.
The Spanish Government President proposed yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in the autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of State deity, liberalisation, employment and employment measures.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish bourses have added 4,5 Pro, double as the same as the of the bears.
In comparison to February, the reaction of the Government and the Spanish Central Bank was quickly and convinced, and we benefit from the surprising effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year state liability that will take the benefits from the trichet effect, and therefore we put on a strong question that will eliminate all doubts about our environmental ability.
For Spain, the request for a help plan would be a self-offrun.
We would receive liquidity that we don't need. The stock has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March.
Nevertheless, our faces should respond to the Motto Caesar's wife: "Now counts not only his, but also the scene."
Just courage, we can do it!
The president of Eulen, on request of his children, addressed Vega Sicilia's company assembly
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owner of the Company Eulen and El Enebro, does not flee.
David Álvarez, a founder of the company's shore, will advise the company assembly of El Enebro, which will be found on request of five of his seven children on the 16th place, because he thinks that they are absolutely refused. His children will try to get a majority to control the administrative bodies of the Company - inhaber of the Weinguts Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons, Jesus David and Mary José, prepare the legal measures for a new capital of justice in their fight to control a part of the company group.
The main main maintenance for business services does not seem to be ready to follow the control of El Enebro's organs.
It was issued from the Governing Board by five of his seven children, which were appointed to the Actionary Assembly of 18 January this year, which has already been approved as a member of the Governor of the Government of the Administrative Council.
The company assembly of El Enebro, invited by the judge of the Court of Commerce No 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has issued a new breakdown in the family of Álvarez.
The call of the Judge to summon the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the integration of the assembly of societies.
The last part of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is recognized by David Álvarez as a "dumped means of the applicant - exhibited by his five children - to allow them to be recognised by lawful detections, disgusting powers and legal abuse for the unexpected congregation of 18 January", as if official speakers.
This argument is the basis for the nearby campaign of the congregation to declare it as absolutely refusal.
The same protagonists who are in discrete weaknesses have already tried to call a congregation on a judicial way in June.
At El Enebro - Employment Society and Inhaber of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, along with other funds - David Álvarez's seven children 100 Pro of the capital.
However, the maintenance of the service group requires more than 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the background of the matter that the judges have decided in the hearing of the treatment of the complaints for which no date has yet been established.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapons of Siemens
The cars are improved with a real time software.
Since Red Bull 2004 entered into the world of formula 1, their history has been presented in this reading universe of speed of surprises and success.
Initially, no one gave newly observed and despite his steel-breaking resort during the last season, all put on the winning of Fernando Alonso Fernando's Ferraris at the end track in November.
Without intending to reduce the ability of the German pilot and world master Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine's power, the "heim weapons", which put the Multi Siemens Red Bull in hands, and thus created a victory team, became a legend.
It is actually a powerful software for the simulation of processes aimed at the German undertaking which are not to do with authors in 2007 on the market.
This information programme covered as PLM was used for the development of mounting chains in manufactures worldwide, energy works and high-accurate instruments.
A reliable reproduction or simulation of a product or process will be raised before it is actually built to avoid such errors and overflow costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous utility vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, leader of the Siemens Industrial Department, explains that using this software in formula 1 - Fabrik Red Bull "in few hours, almost in real time" can create and implement the changes and improvements found on the runs and tests.
Russwurm indicates that 1992 in the rains the average technicals that could have been able to introduce at least three or four improvements in a season.
In Red Bulls team, 180 high-quality young people are employed today. With powerful EDV facilities, they conduct analyses and all possible changes in the car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the components of the Red Bull cars, with the exception of the engine for which the Renault is responsible for.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements will be changed.
The changes can be translated within less than 24 hours from the reality of the simulator, thanks to progressive production facilities and hightech autoclaves.
The only limits set by this foolish technical perfectionism are the 40 million of people who can extract a form 1 - team for his trends in a season.
Red Bull built his hightech factory for the development and manufacture of his cars in a 50 km distance from London.
It is two buildings in which search - especially journalists - are strongly limited.
Everything happens there is Top Secret.
The staff includes 580 persons, two pilots, the worldmaster Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls of true formula 1 - Held is uncertainly the latest world master Sebastian Vetell.
After the enormous resources that the Energy drinker provides in the services of his participation in the ring lines, further protagonists are hidden, whose support is unapprovalable and their knowledge is equal to zero.
The technology head of the work, Steve Nevey, points out that five years ago it was able to say that the progress in the F&E area was contributed to the winning of 50 Pro and the pilots were responsible for the Property.
Today the share values have changed. Technology is 85% of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated to 15%.
Nevey recognizes that wheat and webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they are "not predictable gladiators".
HP will be opened in two years with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) yesterday in Barcelona invited his first exclusive load in collaboration with partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of the sales networks from twenty businesses with a total of 80 to 100 square meters that intend to open the multi in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees with these initiatives with the 16 already existing sales areas in multimarketing, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The representative of HP España, Helena Herrero, called as example the constructed load at the Gran Via in Barcelona, the property of Pont Reyes, with the HP for 30 years.
The North-American Company Group intends to set up 200 sales in Europe until 2010, of which 20 downloads in Spain.
The first weeks were shown in Bukarest (Rumany) and in Serbia. Barcelona is the business.
Mr. Herrera did not want to deliver the future openings, but did not say that Madrid could be the next objective.
The chairman, who is also leader of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy is always the same for the opening of loads.
The Northern American Company Group consults it and takes the exclusive charge (with interactive products to draw) and all countries will look like the same in Europe.
○ HP is responsible for the training of the labour staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a Franchising system and highlighted that with the exclusive purchase network, "the customer service and the advice of Small and Small Business undertakings on purchasing and then optimizing the packages."
The load in Barcelona provides a pioneer pilot program, which provides the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee l.
A online series builds a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and small enterprises and customers because the major companies have already contracted their technical customer service contracts yesterday," said Helena Herroro.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years a million customers to clothe
The Business Board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other manager. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but it will cause a new liquidity crisis and prophesied the end of the debt war.
However, it provides a breakdown of the interest rates that the banks are trying to compare with tax increases and loans prices.
Sabadell expects to start a million customers in three years - a still existing field.
Sabadell has found the way to create the next three years, and so to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guide plan in 2011.
The objective is not only to survive without taking advantage of the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of a million customers - 700 000, if the customers losing the bank - that is the great challenge that this bank has before, since it has yet given more attention to their business business than their abilities.
In this year, it has reached 250 000 customs and 50 000 companies.
The market share is 3.5 Pro, while the business facilities make more than 10 Pro.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 Business Plan is the increase of the products, speaking exterity, reduction of costs. The challenges that the Bank faces will be presented together with the annual final report.
Only a few banks are going to set and publish targets in these difficult times, since all the banks' plans have been discussed by the worldwide financial crisis.
Sabadell will complete its four years ago, which was initially exposed to three years, but according to the marketing plant, he was extended in a business year.
The customers who will leave the guards are the main goal of the bank.
In a APIE organized breakfast, the Guardiola 2011 would be a "great" year "with great riches".
The Manager is going to say that Spain only comes "slowly" out of the crisis.
It would be "very difficult" in two or three years "building work" - basically for the survival of the banks.
Even if it concludes that the war for the passengers - which will punish the interest margins - will be distorted, the risks, the banks and sparcases for their emissions for liquidity will have to be decreased as a compensation for rapid profits already to the price of credits.
"The subjects of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exercise the pressure on the credits."
"We haven't turned the hahn, but the interest differences are very high," Guardiola told.
On Thursday, Banesto already issued the order on its age network to reduce the supply of long-term loans and to increase the interest differences (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The Manager also agreed that the banks currently followed the stategies "to increase the taxes", but "inside one of the competitive frameworks".
Sabadell's guideline is based on a organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate businesses.
He does not make sure that in Spain "great businesses are needed".
"The next year everything will change," he assures.
He emphasises that the need for capital is currently "creasing" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will be cut off in red numbers.
It is the opinion that FROB can replace the money in capital rates.
After he assured that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he will discover the argument of some bankers who already prophesy a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be able to run, but in the subsequence of the events in June, you can achieve short-term financing on resistance and thus get the crisis.
CECA excludes a second merger of sparcasses
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility that it might be able to come to a merger of the sparkasses and stressed the ability to restructure the branch.
When the convergence process of Spanish Sparkassen started, several sparcasses were not shared in the first stage.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassen Federation (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, would not be able to find this second.
"I believe that most of the merges are completed. The incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group can not be considered as a second, it was more than adjustment."
"The majority is completed. It may be that we have in place of seventeenth three or four, but all important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all the operations."
In one breakfast organized by the Business Leader and Manager Aragoniens (ADEA), Olavarrieta concluded that the convergence process was "complete as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the expiry expiration, which was not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España", he emphasized.
"The transition of 45 sparcasses with a average 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a historical incomparable process. The number of financial institutions was reduced by 62% and they are now much greater than we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he highlighted.
Olavarrieta explained: "There have been a number of inappropriate opinions about the long-term process that showed inseries and insensitivity" because "Banco de España urges us to complete the time limit before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financial systems of Europe and "much" of the world, and added that those who doubt this "without deeper knowledge".
The Manager noted that in the current economic conjunction, we need to make "no concern" over the situation of the financial institutions and sparcases, which have passed through a "treatly significant" concertation process that will be completed as soon as possible.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks were very well made the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time conditions for the entire European Union.
The spending on the markets has made a double response of the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, starting on tax reductions for small and small enterprises, regulating time business or repealing the 426 Euro support for unemployment unemployed, until 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State lottery.
On the other hand, the Governing Boss Elena Salgado, with the help of the former President of the Government Felipe González, supports the criticism of the Kanzler Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How do these actions understand?
It is expected that the label position is not a mistake of their public work.
In contrast, it is a new deal in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
In this context, Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective for the creation of our future, which is co-ordinating with the maintenance of the older traditions of a majority of its partners.
In the light of Europe’s oppositions, in Germany it is initiated to speculate three possible outcomes from the crisis.
First: a stronger euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro.
The second: Reintroduction of German Marks - despite the currently sounds more like Science Fiction - , supported by a majority of the public opinion, approximately 50% of the population.
Third: a conversion of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means more economy control; strict budget management; penalty of the countries which exceed the standards; maybe the payment of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment to the private sector.
The German position has been clear and has gone for a while, therefore there are no statements now.
First, 2009, both the IWF and the European Commission were encouraged to deethe, and the German Government took a constitutional reform out of the army to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign for the disagreement between what Germany believed necessary (strict tax plans and stable public funds) and the practices of his partner, France.
The second character set the average country, as a mark, painfully outcome the decision on the salvation of Greece.
It was criticized at that time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and public opinion was absolutely against a salvation of Greece.
It calls for a reform of the Agreements of the European Union to enable a country's salvation and to commit private loans to a part of the costs.
This position was expressed as an anti-essential, since it had predicted the Irish crisis and all the following things.
However, its proposal has been adopted, and in the next months we will share in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has made a red line that does not think of it too much.
It says everyone that, even if there is no need to be taken out of work now, the old function of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new vacation in which the opposing countries will be severely punished, forced to declare incapable of payment and, in this case, the private sector must take part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we must take a strong growth course, with high spare and investment rates, with consumption measurement, improvement of the product and competitiveness and positive external salts.
The other alternatives based on debt and buildings with big lobsters in the payment bi, as referred to by Spain in woodtimes, will simply not be taken.
The boat is clear.
And we would do bad to not understand it.
It is not only about the state defence of three pro-pro 2013 until 2013.
The requests are much worse.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to hurt ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences go over in more peace.
And that we will use the opportunities that we will be offered until early 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understanded this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) indicates that, despite the criticism of labels, the hypothesis, the order in his own house has been prepared for its way.
But the red line held by Germany is there, and it doesn't seem that something would change it.
Under the possibilities taken into consideration, we should not leave the eurospace completely stopped with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it had warned us.
Sports and Policy Environment
Tricks like the Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show finding spirit, but not the will to handle a sanction.
The exclusion recorded by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of tints to whether it was an unportable action or not and whether both players should be sanctionsed by the EUFA.
How general it is, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (you team had already been clearly won) time and played several fouls so that the judge showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will fill the previously written sanction in the next liga game against the Auxerre and so without cards in the next game phase.
The EUFA's disciplinary committee punished the tract of the Club, José Mourinho, with two games and the shared players with different amounts.
The provokation of a yellow map under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather often to meet in the world of football.
It is so far spread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but the rules followed in this sport type.
Part of the debate on the present case is that a team of the Football Club Real Madrid (which in his hymne Edelmut and Honor had punished his players for similar events) played the main role in it, and the dramatization by Mourinho, which has given a episode more to his long history than theatric and provoking technicians.
In any case, the debate refers to whether it is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes to the principles of the sport, which means whether these acts are a rule-contract, which actually holds it on the statutes of the sport, but it seems to be determined.
In this regard, the damage caused by the sports spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opposers, an aspect that was not assigned by these actions because it was not a aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the opposing players take an unfair benefit from the opposite.
The paradox of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand under false game or rules, because the environment of the rule was not secretly complete to avoid a sanction, but it should be as appropriate as possible to be punished by the Court of Justice.
The players waited and accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the opponents from the expected fouls are.
Here should be highlighted that the rival wasn't brought into a more unfortunate situation or the benefits of the game played, because the evident result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with less players.
There is also no useful Property for the next game, because the club then doesn't talk about these players.
The benefit is obviously that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of unknown advantage, since the team could sometimes separate. . The players with this procedure receive a sanction and go over in the second card cycle, where they separate a card with less than in the first cycle.
This is not so clear whether it is actually a benefit.
Finally, such procedures are not against the sports spirit, which also belongs to strategic decisions to benefit the best possible provisions of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to handle any sanctions (that would actually be a clear case of ruler environment), they wanted to choose better where they would undertake it.
They took a strategy decision without a punition or fleeing from her.
Although the limit between finding and the environment is declined, I believe that this is a clear case of finding.
I have the impression that the polymetic has occurred due to two or two: because it was about two self-exclusions, and because of the type of regulatory transfer.
The damage given to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than much more esthetical.
Bottofensive for customer starting for groups' Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictature of the calendar allows this year a lawine of reservations to fall on the day 16 and 17 December.
The feasts paid by employees themselves are spread. They don't want to earn more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turron and Christmas Lottery, there are again group dinners that lead to Barcelona’s guest and free-time acquisition of oxygen. However, according to the economic crisis, they solve a price-official in order to include the customer segment that represents the large mass: Almost everyone wants to expire between 20 and 30 euros for a mid-day or dinner, the concerned enterprises and associations.
In order to become a little more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has left all orders to fall in the week of 13 December, with the result of a lawine of the reservations of dinners at two holidays (16 and 17) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have set up the group's nights from budget bases.
In order not to delay this tradition, many employees pay them from their own bag.
As the conjuncture always states, low prices are requested, the president of the Guest Gremium of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the dach band will not wait until now to predict how the festival will look for this month.
"The people think about it thirty times before they book."
"You want to go out, but they care for the prices," he states.
The business will be good for them to offer the quality to good prices with a good service, and he calls us to the memory that the customers are saved in crisis times, so the prices of EUR 25 will be highly requested.
In a survey of various central restaurants, the evening of December 17, leads the provider to the collaps.
The Soteras Group says that the requests for this Friday, with the intention to issue less than 30 euros, would be trees. The group has adjusted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the conjunction station.
In another leading group, Andilana, who has 16 guests in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and other), has led the property of the calendar to preservations, even since the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible to maintain the pre-year prices with menus for every fun of 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
In the group, El Mussol, Attic, Quu and in total 23 locals, you do not lose the optimism since the second quarter, even though you can see a few days ahead of the birthday work.
Sources of the company group highlight that the 18th day will be an overactive day with friendship groups who preach Christmas.
The six group menus have been added to a Birthday menu for EUR 30 or more or more than priishit. It has the impression that the customers are ready to issue more than in the previous year and want more details, for example, Cava.
Even in some companies, you see green sprays, so the employees are invited again, which shows the impression that the groupnesses are again in exhaustion.
From the Dach Conference Fecasarm (with combinations such as the knife, aurant and free-time association of Barcelona), the representative of the chairman En日 Gomà trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are "live" in total, even if the customers "exhibit a maximum".
However, the fun of the festival hasn't come back, no matter who pays.
The Pacific Nuclear Programme has great concern in the United States
Islamabad sets atomic weapons "faster than any other country".
Enths of Wikileak's occupied relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the Northern American message in Pakistan and the United States Department, enthusiast Wikileaks, which great concerns are prepared by the Pakistan Atomic Programme Washington.
At the border of the clothing and safe details that provide documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they enthink that the cooperation between both countries in atomic matters is not strengthened, but "absorptedly" and that the instable Asian country makes more atomic weapons "to a quicker rythm than any other country".
In relation to the property of the Pakistanian Atomic Programme - that the weapons are not composed, but are stored their individual parts to difficulty getting in a possible attack - prepare Washington without sleeping nights.
The following risks are included by the advocate in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before and before the former leader of the National Security Council, James Jones, on: "The nearby of some atomic plants in the area attacked by the Taliban, the disturbing spread of nuclear material and the accident of transport of nuclear material."
The large number of persons involved in the Nuclearary Canal and the racket programmes will be considered not only by the United States, but also by Russia as an outstanding and reason to take care of.
"Pakistan has to set strictly believed staff to monitor the atomic arrangements; because of the low education and cultural level, extremist organizations have more opportunities to reclute people who cooperate with atomic or racket programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his northern American official colleagues.
The new documentation enthed by Julian Asanges Internetportal is that the cooperation between the United States and Pakistan remains in nuclear spread and the increased tempo, in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, a news office, described as "frustriating" with Pakistan, explains: "There is often no transparency; we don't receive answers on help offers, or they will be rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, calls that "in spite of the economic disaster Pakistan atmosphere as quickly as no other country produces atomic weapons."
The lawyer Patterson asks Washington during an overseer of General Ashfaq Kayani, to "claim the responsibility", that "Pakistan's army has to set his silent about the employment of terrorist groups."
On the jail to Wikileaks Chief
Obama designates a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new enths.
Interpol provides a red warning for the persecution and finding of asange.
All that is associated with Wikileaks and its reasoning, Juiyaan Assange, is a complicated labyrinth, where safeguards are only difficult to reveal.
Yesterday, Interpol gave a "roth warning" to the "affliction and persecution" of the asing.
However, this is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
It is not new, it comes from 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the last enthousiasm of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse which the more needs to be put in Sweden.
The lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, also assures: "The police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
On request of Sweden, the international police officer with Sitz in Lyon (France) issued the order, but it was not granted by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after receiving authority.
The 188 countries of Interpol are assigned to identify and find ascense, "to be firm and deliver him temporarily."
Although Interpol is not able to organize an individual concerned with a red warning, many Member States consider the red warning as a free letter to arrest - which the national police must be carried out - especially if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as the case of Sweden and England, where Asange remains disturbing.
Asange's advocates, publishing a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old Wikileaks' reasoner was ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also remind that Assange requested the outcome from Sweden and that the State advocate, which was compared with the Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the safety head of Stalin, received the appropriate authorisation.
"This is like a jail, not as a legal persecution," is accused in writing.
The world is looking for him - and his mother's disappointment for the innocentness of her son - asange stops in an unknown place, but it is not awesome.
On Monday, he gave to the leader of the magazine Time per Skype from an undetermined place from an interview. In the conversation he asked the United States State Secretary, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be demonstrated that it was responsible for the North American diplomats to spite the United Nations and thus violate international agreements under the United States, it must have come back," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the president of the white House, Robert Gibbs, who repeated the request for retraction as "release and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should be worth the opinion of a guy with a website," he explained to the sender CNN.
Obama himself has ordered a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight, Russell Travers, to prevent new documentation processes.
The attempt of the president Barack Obama's speaker to give ascense less attention is in contrast with the views that the conservative and commentaries are declared in these days.
The Congress Deputy Peter King, who will lead to the president of the National Security Committee since January, has invited the State Department to examine the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to kill their money and to follow everyone who supports them or allows a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, adviser of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, was still gone, and he had to revoke his statement, Asange must be killed.
"Obama had to convert him into a target ship and use an unexpected aircraft or something."
Who did not excuse was Mike Huckabee, baptism minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidency candidate.
"Whoever it was who gave information to the Government, he was guilty of the tradition and everything that is not fitting is too mild punishment," he explained to the sender Fox.
Puigcercós looks for the neighborhood peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the Partie to vote secretly on its residence in the Official Journal.
Huguet proposes a pluralist government and the end of the full assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a receipt to get out of the road for the fourteenth time of an internal rebel in the series of 11 members and the help of the electoral voices.
The president of the Parties is aware that his threat to retreat is not sufficient to the neighbors of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is so weak today as its mentor itself and he will not protect the same headbreaks as other former streams.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra is trying to win the new critics with an eyewater, which would ensure its position until the next communal elections.
For the beginning, yesterday, the over 200 regional Council members of the ERC could be expressed secretly over its remains in the office.
With electoral notes, not with a lifted hand.
If the Carodists wanted to prevent the president of a penalty record, they could do this without repressing.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of splitting and the impression of submission under his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would feel with the half of the voices plus one unemployed, and he would add without indicating proef values, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good.
The Carod Neighbours ask the President more than the party only to provide his office. An inadequate gesture because Puigcercós controls the top organ of the Congress.
However, since they have no sufficient majority to force retractions, they will agree with the proposal for a procedure plan from now to May.
That is why they expect to contribute to the development of the strategy reorientation document that the guide will be presented to the Council on 18th vote.
Their purpose is to pay for Puigcercós. On the contrary, he has to promise to present the Congress in the herbst of 2011, what the partial pitch already considers.
The President of the ERC is the opinion that the "polyphonia" harmed the stability and he strives to always allow the organization to wash their painful weapons behind the closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the official Conseller Josep Huguet in blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an idealist, the inhabitant of innovation believed that the party president would be based "in exchange against different objectives".
He counted five, two of them standing in front.
First, the "restructuring" of the proposal to represent at least 90% of the members of the Parties, which means the incorporation of new faces from the Carods environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should abandon the full collection principle as a functional way.
In this way, he distorted a reform of the statutes to allow the congresss to be held with selected delegates.
From the end of the assembly model - a exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, who has already been fighting for the last two congresss, as it is.
In fact, in the 2008 appointed assembly, the board of the Parties was assigned to review the full assembly principle on a congress that should be addressed with the reform of the statutes.
This appointment is still being concluded, since the infogle of the internal exhibition of the last years was not advisable to the approach of this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors, it could be the time to recover this matter and end forever.

Legal Exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN explained that the former Panist Chairman has the right to return to the National Order Commission and to request what the right would be accepted to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former president of the PAN had the right to return to the National Order Commission and to request what the right would be accepted to him.
In an interview that was located before the complaint of Gabino Cué Monteagudos as Governor of the State of the Federal State, he declared that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to return to the Commission de Orden del Council, in the case of the difficulty, in order to make a decision by a competent body," he adds.
On the other hand, he explained that it would not be at the time to think in 2012 and that a alliance to the presidential candidate had never been seated at the negotiationist.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that national action strengthened from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his followers were chosen.
"This (a alliance in 2012) is a topic that never was on the negotiating stage at least not until now. It was a proposal for the assembly election he was prepared and fulfilled his purpose," he realized.
The panic leader explained that the PAN looks back to dialogue at 71 years, therefore "not fearing the internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy them and strengthen us," he commented.

"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the crack," he confirmed.
He believes that the inheritant of the Federal Government expressions like those he can make in a discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because there is no boundary or less a censure in this country.
Obama is installed in Twitter for the law for undocumentated students
"If you are for the distortion of the Dream Act - Law, then call your senators and force the derogation of this law," said the President of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the country-wide mobilisation to support the Dream Act - Law on legalization of undocumentated students with a message on personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the destruction of the Dream Act - Law, then call your senators and force the destruction of this law," twisted Obama.
His short notification contains a Cyberlink to a larger document that invites the public to contact their senators immediately, since the vote of the law is directly favoured.
"with the voice we're waiting for, the time is coming to listen to you," he stresses.
The message was spread after the 42 Republican senators refused to block all votes for each law, except the extension of tax reductions from Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the spread of atomic weapons.
About the blocks of the Republicans of the Law Dream Act and other projects, president Robert Gibbs said, he trusted that, when the tax theme was solved, a timetable for the other projects could be established.
"I think we have a lot of time yet..."
"All of us agree that tax business must be developed before the end of the year..."
"I think we can take an agreement at any time, and then we can plan the end of the term," he said.
The president of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, said on Saturday, "he would appoint the vote on the conclusion of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law, with which the initiative to legalize undocumentated students could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, though the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act - Law or the Law of the American Tra would legalize about 800 000 young people who were immigranted to the United States when they were not six years old, while they had been conducted in this country in the last five years and were entered into an educational institution or in the army.
However, the violants of the law need to decrease the initiatives of 60 votes, therefore they are designated to vote on a handful Republican, and at the time, the organizations of the speakers of this project are organizing an intensive influence on the derogation of the law.
The democrats of whom the majority undertake the Dream Act have more than 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said that he would vote, and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support to the law.
Therefore, the Defensors of the Dream Act must have several republians on their side, if other democrates should decide to deal with the initiative.
Of the most surrounded Republicans, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who received the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Ha日 from Utah and Kay Bailey Huinson from Texas, but they claimed that it was no longer to be understood at another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his attitude.
Although the representative house has another version, the analysers agree that the dream Act stands before the greatest obstacles.
With literature put the finger into the wounds
The second part of 'The Lust in the Language' was a passport in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"The sex in the language I understand yes, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected from me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second part of 'Los placeres de la language', a cycle who celebrated the Spanish literature and used the subtitle of her question at this occasion (in another event the table was dedicated to the sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "build us in difficulties," the argentinian writer shocked to the public, which was mostly composed of young people who were gathered at the International Bookmass in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this modern table by Marisol Shultz to participate in the Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she gave to Gonzalo Celorio, and then recognized the Shultz as a wonderful story. Luisa told in the first person and is the protagonist who is on the search to learn what is a "wound" and from Ar'a, of whom she does not answer, but has instructions for the leading of her story.
"Patience is not my strength, maybe it's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the dream atologists, who put the breath in the middle of the gang, and who explains that the wounds are not a scientific concept, the psychoanalytic is a secret: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the narbe."
The main figure of the story makes it easier and concludes that "from the wound they only learned that it is really open and not existing". But she is convinced that the pleasure in the language and their cases are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguaner Sergio Ramírez also presented an exciting story that he called 'Lob of the finding', and in which the finger in the wound is not seen, but it is discovered.
With examples of the magical realism, he told a famous tuberculous who touched the clouds, who returned a lot of traveling men or restored the lost tugend of a girl. The story made a rotation and reported by America, the Great Roman, who did not lack to his own cronists from the beginning, and cited Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the overflush of the stories spoken by the Erobers.
"Cervantes, who invited us to all (the writers), fooled the predicted Witnesses who had appeared in the stories shown as true, but in other ways the history of America would never have been spoken - with educational power that even came to the shame."
However, he highlights, "which is the foolish and lying people who present the things in the best way," and there are reality and lies near one to another, where you do not know no longer what the story belongs to where the fixed literature reaches the gapfel.
He actually calls that the Tradition Cervantes.
"Of him we're proud to be what is saying."
When Mayra Montero was in the row, the writer commented and praised the case of the interpret, to which the invitation of the FIl to the "The Finger in the Wood" table was attended.
The Kubanian and Puertoricanin have contributed to the great wounds of social violence, as well as the whole Latin America, as the result of the fights on trade.
"I believe that it contains literature, poetry, li ́ contains a quiet, not recently planned commitment," she explained, after she had highlighted that literature is communication and commitment that builds between the author and the readers, such as a "chemical reaction".
On the evening, the Spanish Dicker Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "the finger of the engaged writer in the wound of the writer's wound."
He noted that in a quickly living world the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness are also running on dogmatics, and will be forgotten, "that behind every activity is a small none and behind every disbelief a small yes."
"To be in possession of our thinking and reality, we need to announce: And Nuanciers often mean put the fingers in the wounds and becoming those who feel much better when they think in the form of carriers, in black and white, in pre-nuanced ideas, and also insulting the mighty who prefer to share the world in black and white, he noted and invited to discover a sense of writing.
Romano fights about his first title
Ruben Omar Romano looks back to three downloads in end games, he has learned ups and abs in his car, but three times he played determining games.
In the duell between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, two different styles, provided by their respective trainers, and the meeting known by opposers reflects in the results.
Ruben Omar Romano looks back to three downloads in finishing games, he has learned ups and abs in his car, but three times he has had decided games, and until now he has felt well, why this opportunity is very important for him.
The Argentinan played up with the medaille to the second champion, he was a step behind the winners, and amazingly he had performed the same team-consequent end games.
The sanistic strategy reached the first end game as Trage at "Torneo Opentura 2002", when part Morelia had the tours in hand, with which he learned a great degradation against Toluca with 4-2; later, in the "Clausura 2003", he reached the decided duell that he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Just with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Ruben had to retrieve, since the game with 2-2 against Los Choquéeros after 210 minutes was unexpected, but at the elf meter he arrived with 3-1 and got two opportunities to put his title in, but three players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Ruben had already two end games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, ≥ big rivals, lost. Therefore, he wouldn't want to be persecuted again from the disaster and free from the evil pillar to be able to celebrate a title first, even though he confirms that it is the most important game for him.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, it's for a club, for my pleasure, which I'm giving, and therefore the title will come to me, but what has previously been the most important thing," commented the taxman when asked him about the lost end games.
The final game is still strong in his memory, he assured to have learned much of it: "The only lesson we can get out of it is that until the judge does not finish the end, we can not celebrate, we are prepared on the line, for the last time we were prepared with two elf meters, and I think that this is a lesson until the game is finished, there is no opportunity to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by elfmeter shooting, it doesn't hurt him because he trusts his players: "You never want to come at the elf meter shooting, you want to end in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you must be prepared to prepare, in the previous tour, but, despite all, the shick Hall prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to the nervousness or hard effort to keep the title already in the hands, which left us something for this game, and we hope that it would not come to this time."
It is in Romanso power to be no longer a second champion and first to cost the glory that the titles bring with them.
The United States amends the rules for the receipt of a visa.
The persons must be presented before their interview at the consulat at the service offices for Visa request; the costs will be reduced as such.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for requesting a Visa are amended in the United States message and in the consue.
In the new procedure, the majority of the applicants must be presented before their interview at the Consulat at the Vis-Request Services (ASC, the beginning letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall take the biometric data of the applicant to be checked by the Consulat before the talk.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total decreases are decreased for the deviation of the visa, because it is no longer necessary to pay the termination, the processing of the vice request and the transport service with which the document is deferred.
The applicant shall provide only one single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the presence of 140° for a tourist visa, 150° for visa with request (a visa for timeworkers) and 390° for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa must not take any talk in the consulate, they must only imagine the ASC where they present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data are obtained in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for talking in the consulate remain less time than earlier.
Those who bean the visa in the consue of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must not pay the service charge of 26.

NASA announces the Foreign Life Fund
The Northern American Room Division Agency invited a press conference to present a fund tomorrow that will have effect on the search for living in all.
The United States National Air and Space Concern (NASA) provides tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiological discovery that could affect the theory of the existence of alien lives.
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at 13.00 p.m. at a press conference in the NASA seat in Washington by experts of astrobiology, which is an investigation of the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe.
In the implementation of the press conference, the NASA assured that it would present "a surveying fund for the search for foreign life", which would exclude the speculation of experts of other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that it could exist human creatures in enemy environments that you have considered to be inhabitable until now. The hypothesis was opened that they could transform themselves into intelligent lives - as humans - when their live conditions improved.
It is apparently a microbe found on the basis of the Mono Lake in the Yosemit National Alpark, California. It is le ́d in a environment that has been held too too too too too much for all the worldwide forms of life, since the sea is strongly arsenary.
In some way, the microbie uses the arsen as a survival resource. In view of this ability, the chances are that there may be similar life on other planets that do not have over our atmosphere.
When these organisms change the arsen, the astrobiologists show that "is actually a different lifestyle, a second lifestyle that distinguishes from us."
Tomorrow, on Thursday, the Room Room Agency gives the real range of its funds at the press conference tomorrow.
At the conference, the Geobiological Pamela Conrad shares the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the creators, Titan (the largest moon of Saturns) is studying whether its chemical composition is similar to the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and pattern form an opposition block
With the reform of the congress network, the two-party system is introduced, they complain.
It had just started the 60th legislative period, and an opposition block was already installed, indicated by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who represented himself as independent. The four questioned: the entrance of the two parties system into the room.
Before the start of the introduction session in the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the original network, because they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeatedly introduced a 'two parties' system because there would now be two persons, the same number of parties controlled the Congress.
These four members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the president of the Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his property as a representative of the president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties would have introduced their political opinion institutionally with these reforms.
He concluded that in the next days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, which resulted from its political will, and if they had not, they would again be subjected to both parties to the end of opposition education.
"I will come here (the coalition of opposition), that is what I see, because we will be excluded from all decisions that do not even take attention to the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez of Convergencia explained that there were agreements with PRD, PT and patron and that there would be a pluralist group.
It cannot be permitted, he continued that the Congress, after he was monopolist, should now be "duopolistic".
"It's not the spirit of law reform that a eternal two-partial system should be governed in the Congress."
"For the beginning this group starts with five Members and they speak with other colleagues and colleagues so that they become more," said the Convergencia-Mitglied.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, as an example of PAN and PRI, showed that the Congress has currently been converted into a "buy" for two.
"Before it was only a party, now they shared this too two."
Patrón Montalvo requested to respect the Members and to give them their place to the negotiations.
"The five, which are probably nine Members, cannot be proposed outside due to the decisions of the vote, which are likely to be nine, and the five who are currently seen as separate in different groups have decided to join our place to be in the negotiating table, because because of the reform that was carried out and delivered by the other, we remain outside and we are not agreed with this reform."
200 000 more peso for "the supplier"
The town management of Mazatlán pays another scheck to the conflicted owner of the company for electronic materials.
Another scheck over some more than 200 000 peso for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city manager.
The sum paid to the owner of the company for electric material in the second half year is 1.20,000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this scheck was issued on a amount of 200.144,56 Peso with the number 9258447 last 16 November with the use of "From open accounts".
The teacher Luis Miguel López Moreno had already foretold that more money from the community would go to this supplier. It was observed by the auditorium Superior del State because it was recovered to higher prices.
What has not been denied is the total amount that you still debt and thus the number of shocks that are still exposed to Camacho Palazueless.
"There was nothing covered with her, it is just payable for the debts, just as the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The latest checks "made" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as it is prescribed legally, when an ASE firm is submitted in question to avoid other administrative services, the teacher assured that its services would not be revoked again.
After publishing the newspaper of Northwest on 25 July the examination of the schecks issued by the city administration to his suppliers, it was that before, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year official period of the citizen Jorge Abel López Sánchez had paid the church over 10 million pesos with 42 shecks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also businesses with Jumapam located where they entered checks in the value of more than 3 million peso.
Tourist places must be improved
Tourists undertaken the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad state of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist in the entrance of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán requested to give special attention to the authorities, the areas in a bad state and cast a bad image to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the trade union of the Zona Dorada, reminded that at different occasions it was requested to set the traveling goal and to convert the bad conditions that the tourists faced to new employment opportunities or routines.
He said that the bad state of roads and roads would have been negatively affected, since tourists were coming to the blind and see the injustice, but they would turn back to the nearly located lands.
"The more don't know what it means to close a company on one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, for otherwise they would not do the building work in this way slowly and unplanned."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's tower would have made attention to the missing prevention and the remaining maintenance work from the city.
"The assembly must take its responsibility and avoid what happens again. How is it to do so? Well, by a preventional preservation instead of to improve everything in the afternoon," he explained.
"We expect to have a clean city, because not only because it is a foreign transport area, it must be maintained, but we also have the right to a clean living room. The city administration has to change its ability to get the city in a good state."
"There are other places that also look inappropriate and incomplete," he said, "e.g. el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today, we need more than just advertising to block tourists. It must be offered a product, a city that cleans its streets and streets, and keeps the tourist attractions continually in shooting," he added.
"There has not been given sufficient attention and this type of events only makes what is manifest for all: a holding is urgently necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, a subsecret of Promoción Turistic, expressed how important it is to save the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not have adequately enjoyed and allowed a bad image to be raised.
The city should be made pure, ordinary and attractive for the foreign transport.
"Happy, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural places that must be cleaned and cleaned once to make them attractive to the foreign transport and to bring them to the inventar with which we cast for this trip.
IP requests the results from the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that the Members should take the great responsibility to give an example of a better sinaloa, which is before many challenges.
The business industry of Mazatlán calls for a valuable Parliament, free from discharge to the parties and the Government, because Sinaloa is disappointed and is confronted with great problems.
The 60th Parliament was invoked yesterday. It is set out of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergence and another of PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to make a clean job, to feel obliged to the society and the different social groups, which are designated to a responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and pateralism.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the Coordination Council of Understanding CCE, proposed that the new Members should take the great responsibility to give an example of a better sinaloa, which is before many challenges.
"We hope that the Members actually exercise their right to act free from discharge between the parties, because it is usually that they take agreements with which they represent their own interests, that they transform themselves into the Karneval Compars of Governors and the leaders of the Parliamentary Groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to the creation of the needed bridges to support the current government.
"We're concerned that they perform a trustworthy work and use themselves in front of all things for the society and their groups, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who had put their trust in them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Conference, considers one of the great challenges that the 40 representatives face is the offer and joint work for the economic growth of the State, since today the economic stock is very complicated.
"The most important is to achieve economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will somehow promote the creation of jobs."
In the context of the foreign transport industry, he requested the new Members to grant the necessary position in the State budget in order to promote the Ministry of Foreign Traffic.
"I have understood that the Ministry is with the secondary resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings devises and investments into the country and is in direct competition for agriculture."
The tourist projects must be assigned money, the State security must be subjected and the alcohol law which has not been renewed in previous legislative periods must be put to the latest position.
Searching for the Holy King
Puppes, cars, drivers and other games desire the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For parents it will be difficult to meet these desires on the next day of Christmas because the budget is not more and less than 12 persons and a goat box.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel don't allow Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar to give them the game tool and clothing pieces that they are so exciting.
The family resides in a modesty house in the seat of Salvador Allende. She lives from the hand into the mouth because the father has no fixed work.
"As sometimes hard times have been told because my husband has no job, but we're deploying mandarins and cartoffles... I'm going with the garments to buy the street," Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a puppet or a road, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wanted a barbie puppet.
The year old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' since sometimes, and for his eight months old brothers, Jesus offers Cayetana clothing in the size of a year.
" (José Alfredo) said to me, "I would like this monster," but I answered him, "Let us wait, boy," because it was very hard," Cayetana felt triste.
For the older children in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The 11-year-old Maria Guadalupe has the size 12; the year-old Isaiah is the size 10, while the eight-year Miguel size 8 is.
The 14-year-old José Juan fell tennis shoes. A couple in the size of 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dreams of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela, you can share in the 'Heiliger King is searched' campaign by playing a game or money in the receipt Hall of the journal Norwest s.
14 mutilated deals arrested
In the middle of the middle-week, a production and sales network of Cannabis was carried out on the home investigations in the administration region of Estonia.
Four persons have been arrested and will be charged with various complaints.
The home searches were played in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, at the places where the main of the manufacture should have served.
"It has been confiscated about 750 cannabispepenen, four kilo hashish, bars and equipment that have served the production," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaker of the security police of Quebec.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, from which two of the men, which are considered as the main draughter of the ring, came from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons must be spent hours after their arrest in Sherbrooke before the justice building.
They may, inter alia, be accused of the production of canabis, whose owners have to purchase, completion and crime service.
These home investigations have found place in a long-term investigation activity that has been located for over a year.
"The information received by public hand has enabled us to carry out these arrests," exactly Mr Ruel.
About the 70 police of the Regional Research Unit, Estrien of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Service and Memfrèmegog were involved in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be followed without problems
The draft legislation of the conservatives, which, according to the Government, aims to regulate the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be drawn up by all perspectives after the three opposition parties have given the middle week that they cannot prevent the proposal.
"I'm teaching me with pressure against this chart."
"I'm holding with a party who put your feet on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, the leader of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session is expired before the members gathered.
The Liberals claimed that the draft legislation allowing each person coming from a person identified for the transport of illegal immigrants until a year shall be violated as proposed by the Canadian Law and Freedom Constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Quebécois, also stated that the draft law could not be subjected because he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are contrary, and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed, so we will wait for what the government does," said Duceppe.
The criticism of the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, NDP, has refused the criticians to ask that their party had not been adequately dealing with the secret immigrants.
"The Neo Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to do by transmitting another draft law, C-35," chow.
Therefore, we do not want the draft law of the conservatives because he is seeking the guilty of the refugees and holding children captive for at least a year," said Chow.
Imigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties to play with and ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians have increasingly shared the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of private immigration, these criminal acts related to Canada and treat the country as a foot-up."
"You expect Canada to take hard measures," as Minister Kenneys' response.
"The Government has not announced any trust vote regarding its draft law that could lead the country to elections that the Government would have rejected.
However, a conservator expressed the QMI Agency that the Government would call for a vote so that each opposing deputy stated to his electors immediately.
The new unit does not find a singleness
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion from Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister for Public Security, claims that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New Yorker Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
Since 1870, the Metropole is over a standing unit against corruption.
However, the announcement of Middle Week has surprised more than one.
It must be said that this action has not been discussed at the latest meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebecer Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
It did not also fail that Stéphane Bergeron, criticer and member of the Party of Quebécois, this announcement in pointo public security as "sustained caninons" and "in a dished solution" as well.
Minister Dutil had turned back to those who promised that the political power had too much influence on the questionary, future unity.
"You'll see the result when we'll declare it," he'll confirm.
"Man is aware of this problem."
According to Rejean Parent, President of the CSQ, nothing can be replaced by the implementation of a public investigation.
"When Mr. Charest continues to prevent the education of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to be able to form an investigation committee is the retraction of Jean Charest," explained Yves Boisvert, Do® for ethics and systems at the ENA (State High School for High Administrative Training).
In order to get out of this gas, he proposes to Quebec to establish a special mandate for the financial check in order to make such investigations related to corruption and secret deficiencies.
"I should be able to expand the mandate of the test control," he entschied.
He also assumes that the Quebec of the investigation control could take the same power as Commissioners, which would allow them to commit the people to say.
The creation of a standing unit is not the only project in the Charest government's shopping.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to change the penalty law in order to be better set up on this kind of crime.
This question comes from the Supreme Advocate of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier of the fact that the legal pronouncement in this type of criminal persecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, State Minister for Public Security, visited on his side, his colleagues of justice, Rob Nicholson, are currently involved with certain newspapers related to this dossier.
During the Operation Printems 2001, the groups of enginerad policies were arrested 131 persons, although the penalty law was not renewed.
This is why Ottawa has implemented the law against anxiety.
Rivers under strict monitoring
Several fluid flows continue to be strictly monitored because of the high deficiencies that have been held in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in Maurice, it came to an earthquake on midnight.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
On the evening, there was another earthquake in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, the administration region Lanaudiere.
There's a street together.
From Tuesday to Middle Wednesday, strong rainfalls have occurred from 40 to 70 millimeters of disasters to several regions.
A further decree between 20 and 40 millimeters was expected here in accordance with the regions until Thursday.
The areas of the north of the flood and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
Overall, up to 100 millimeters of rain viewers were down here.
Since the snow milk which has already been gathered in certain parts is to be calculated to these deficiencies, it will be threatened to overcome several water flows.
In the middle of the week, the Quebecer Security Service warning on the highwater alarm on the Ureau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region was called.
The flights in the north, in Saint-Jerome, in the Laurentine Mountains and the Chéne in Lotbinière are here to be the object of the highwater monitoring and continue to be observed.
In the Lanaudière region, the hazardous disasters have followed the oversight of some sea in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a broadcast was prolonged due to strong rainfalls.
Ten residents had to be evacuated as a preventive action.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain sea has caused the slip of several streets, especially in the community of Mansfield and Pontefract.
The security service remains in alarm preparation and monitors the situation most accurately, such as Annik Bouchard.
The Quebecer Landeshochwasser area has issued warning on its side at the middle of the midweek of the strong increase of several rivers, especially from Machkinongé, Asomption, Ouareu, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont assigned to part
The Quebecer Moderator Stéphane Dupont, before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Standards (CCNR), has made a part of his contrary statements on social precautions and haitians as well as because of his accidental discourse on radio.
The CCNR represents the opinion, Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their own opinion, but certain expressions had, however, "no information about social care and unfairly negative representations of the Haitians, as well as such unfair reasons that are not appropriate to the daily transmissions."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a debate on suicide, which includes the distribution of the names of two persons who have committed suicide, was violated against the code of transfer.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first delivery was made due to a complaint of the "Front commun of persons assistance social du Quebec".
The activist organisation claimed that the amounts referred to in the sending were unnecessary.
Moderators should rather provide strongly as irrelevant information.
As regards the subject of self-mord, Moderator Stéphane Dupont had the opinion that the suicide was a expression of fiability.
The majority of the supervisory Council members had concluded that the message is that self-mord should not be considered as a solution to live crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" sending would have affected a sensitive topic in a family and adequate way."
Thus, he was not taken up with any tape to his person.
The last controversy point was the statements in Haiti related to the earthquake.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had provided a medium-effective discussion that has occurred a lot of reactions.
The CHOI Moderator had explained that they were not spent for Haiti's help because they were not safe to know whether the needs would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments were not unusual characters that, however, their cumulative effect represents an unfair negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already rejected my three-day suspension punishment in this thing."
"My act has been juvenile for a half years," said the Moderator.
In all decisions, the Surveillance Board enlarges the spread of an unfair expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM has acted as "without its obligations".
The consequences of the sender, which, inter alia, had to notify its decisions uniquely during the main time of sending within a period of three days, are low.
A king of the Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacedrine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The atlet that is held in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxes and in Thaiboxen, now grows in searching for new challenges to the tatami and to the boxing of the world.
"I started in Algeria 12 years ago with battle sports like Kung-Fu and Kickboxes," said Zemmal, who has been sitting in the Metropole since 2008 to continue developing among the professionals.
I personally look for the battle of all places, because for those who are not like to present the mixed war arts, fighting in North America is rare."
Recently, the worker of his sign as a security officer, as well as the UPS firm, had published bad news to his rivals, in which he met in the World Carate World World World World World World World World World World, between 23 and 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland, the world headquarters of the Amateurs, two gold medals from the World Carate and Kickboxing Propertyation (WKA).
"I grew the victory in the categories of the full contact of Kickboxen and Thaiboxen," he explained.
"I'm currently preparing for the world pocal in San Shou in China."
"The warriors were invited from every category that had been placed in the last world mastership among the first four."
"I got my baby in 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"2005 I've become the following in Vietnam."
"2007 I ended the tournament in China on the fifth place while I became the third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's noteworthy that I have made progress in every fight."
"I'll be first with this rhythmus this time or in the next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are from China coming dish-lines, in which foot and foot stepping are allowed as ground-wheels.
The two fights are usually playing on a platform, rarely in a boxing.
The most renommated box fighter, which has proved from this kind of battleport, is the American vietnamese origin of Cung Le, which is probably in the world of fight arts.
If Nacer had only a single event in his car, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super-Turnier "King of Sanda", the Super Bo's Kung-Fu.
"This wet fight is the highest and looked at China," explained the sympathic pump boy.
"It's a little like the equivalent to the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium of Thailand)."
"It was a super-exercise."
Sometimes in the half final of his category (80 kg) he had won his first battle before he lost in the end.
"The one who hurt me was a real Professor," he analyzed.
"There are four mixtures per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the halffinals take each other at the end of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer themselves to crown a single champion, the King of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without exemption
Hydro-Quebec has approved project planning forms in mutual agreement 450 million_ contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle project.
In the middle of this Lawine of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor firms, which has received the most important part of the project leadership to a sum of 295 million.
This consortium, called "Energy gerance", was designed as a compliance with the decision of Hydro-Quebec, to the sector their responsibility, to transfer this important, hydroelectric project in a sum of 5 billion.
In early 2005, the Consortium "Energy gerance" concluded the lucrative treaty without a public claim.
For the Parties Quebécois, the recovery of business consortia is a serious ethical problem which is a result of the risk of competition distortion and an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of a carded game and disappoints competition."
"It means that you're able to play carded games in a secret way and now in open form," said Silvain Simard, a member of the PQ, at the press conference last.
Simard opened the question before the national assembly early morning, because it seems to be hard to understand how the interest of the public can be used in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted on the afternoon, putting it in mind that it would have been a carded game in this Treaty.
"I remain faithful to my line," she warned by strengthening that the PQ had been "injustified" and "feel her to hers".
She said that it was "as the least," that the PQ was apologizing.
The model of the consortium is worldwide accessible practices.
It is usually a time-term agreement that allows two or more companies to join their experts in relation to a command to a claim for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project shows a high level of complexity in respect of its work.
The building procedure is currently and must be established until 2012.
However, the Treaty was forgiven without having been able to find a competition fight; it had already been negotiated.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer a exception in relatively simple projects.
According to the last week of the newspaper "Le Devoir", the model applied in the area of building engineering and consultation is the subject of government investigations.
A short overflow of the Quebecer Employment Governor allows the name of more than 200 consortians from which some seem to be permanent.
In this way, for example, the Company Dessau in partnership with the majority of its nuclear competitors, in which CIMA+, Génivar, SNC lavalin or also rock and tecsult.
Each link, and there are several duties, leads to one and the same legal person, namely to Dessau.
As regards the "Energy gerance" consortium, Ministerina Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James has been subject to a special workforce dynamic and that Hydro-Quebec has taken into account in particular since the 70s".
Real Laporte, the large employee of the Société d'energie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a claim that has made the nose appeal to that the draft guide has been authorised.
"If you make a claim and there are only few applicants, your prices will be faster."
"You have two possibilities: either you take those who are on this March and say to you: a pleasant agreement will be negotiated at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that the price is not determining, but the expertise of persons," confirmed the laport.
This contract authorised to the Consortium "Energy gerance" is part of a long list of contracts received by the Partie Quebécois.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, more than 100 engineers and advisers contracts, companies or their employees, including resource labs, were authorised between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC lavalin had made 22 contracts, Genivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without computing their contribution to "Energy gerance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They are totally charged by $449 783 344, including the "Energy Gerance" contract over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had claimed that the four companys who form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) of "Parti libéral du Quebec" were well-aware.
Ministerial Normandeau had claimed that the PQ was equally connected to the companies they had "financed" before it claimed that it was much more about their leading forces.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Green, but unfounded skeptic.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also less on the known marks or the eco labels to control his choice.
Damage, although it is in a medium-effective universe, where information for a responsibility-known consumption only is so mixed: the barometer's responsible consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, an insufficiency that makes it known as a breaming of his commitment, as the first reading showed that it was stopped yesterday.
Although they have offered the consumption of such socially susceptible products in 2010, the Quebecs seem to be charged by those who are trying to charge a little credit.
Two thirds of the Quebecer population are allowed to give the environmental engagement of companies a little faith as the green company's acquisition, so that the mechanism of the responsible consumer of the University of Sherbrooke is delivered.
Another conclusion: the help of consumers doubts the confidentiality of the official certificates, which are generally fair products, but also the credibility of products and labels that are aware of the environment, as the barometer.
According to the same pattern, only 14.6% of the Quebecer population will be taken seriously.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently a third of the Quebecer consumers.
In fact, empty and suspicious characters of the information were the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second, on the side of the barometer, identified brains according to the price of the products.
○ a third of the Quebecer's specific performance of the green products and services that you are trying to put on them is mistakenly against.
According to another communication, the assistance of consumers has already changed their habits in 2010 and has mainly changed the mark of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they also prefered to 61% purchases in the traders of their city quarter and benefited from purchasing food built in their region.
Greener and responsible conscious - the environmental consumption index has reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 in this year - the Homo consumption of Quebec lie is to present himself as King of Recycling, trying to reduce its tracks left in the environment by careing for the protection of animals.
However, social and ecological consciousness seems to be preserved by a car, so the barometer: just 28% of the Quebecs have indicated that they have benefited from public food in 2010 or preferred the cohesion center to demonstrate their environmental interest.
The driving and the driving were also involved by 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive behaviour that eats the closical ideas.
State facilities for the receipt of eXcentris
The Quebecer Government, which was invited by the Société and the company to participate financially in the receipt of the Chinese complex eXcentris, agreed with a cooperation, but only in the form of competitive facilities.
The developer company and the company Parallelle, who had hoped that a cost of seven million people from the Ministry of Culture for the receipt of Daniel Langlois Chinese complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent would not receive what they requested.
Although the Government has accepted involvement in this matter, however, in its own conditions.
Instead of the expected spending, the Quebecer Government offers an opportunity in less than the initially expected height that could call for a existing solution to beneficial conditions in life, at least as regards the sources acceptable from the state cotton.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec, which has been corrected from the summary to below.
A proposal with a action plan has already been sent by the President of the Société de Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, to the Minister of St-Pierre, leading the act eXcentris.
A few days ago, he had given her a last case report.
However, the opposite proposal of the cabinet was submitted to the SODEC at the middle week.
Parallels and  firs have time to answer them until 31 December.
In any case, it seems that the Princes of the State spending are truly attracted to the side.
We recall that Quebecer has rejected a direct state investment to support the receipt of eXcentris by providing the argument that the Ministry of Culture has no financial assistance for immobility projects that he has not allowed to have other Chinese sales.
However, several other market shareholders in the segment complained about substantive, economic assistance.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois, after its own financed construction of the Kinos for years, had presented the authorenkino in the spaces of his Chinese complex, which could justifie the exemption from the state tax.
The lack of Chinese sales showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the stage.
The Societé and the Company Parallelle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, control a private financed campaign from which they hope a sum of $700,000 to cover the acquisition.
Since early 2009, only one single linchway continues to show movies in eXcentris, namely Le Parallelle.
The goal of the future purchasers is to open the three cinesales on February 27, next year with the introduction of the very learned film of Xavier Beauvois "Des Humans et del dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not revoke the newspaper "Le Devoir" and ignore what he and his group holds from the following corrected proposals that they have been made to them.
Mystery of the complex shaded Canadian
The new, ananasic diplomatic guides spread by WikiLeaks claimed the secret about what the United N° under the minority complex of the Canadians regarded against the Americans, but with the same strike they opened the overlining feeling to Canada.
As a result, the Diplomates of the Canadian Diplomates are surprised that the Canadian elector has no meaning for the Canadian-American relations, and they believe that the President Obama's chairman would have helped the Conservative Government to implement its budget of 2009!
The four new communications between the Ottawa and Washington, which have been publicly spread yesterday, offer more picant details than the only substantive content to be stuck.
One connection of 22 September 2008, which is the period in which the federal election campaign was fully available, reports on the point where the United Nations will no longer participate in the rates discussed by their political heads.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the newspaper in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various clarification opportunities for this situation.
"Een of the Canadians who are almost inhabiting minority complex may encourage the Canadian, political leadership forces to speak much more about inner issues of every day than to move the United States to the black Peter at this election (as in 1988 in the free trade campaign)," he describes.
The United Nations, as he concludes, are therefore "the speaking goliath of this choice: all representatives, but too dangerous to talk about him."
The lawyer understands this "ear-deploying silence" as the two countries are intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assessed, "is the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more than a party to lead such a essential relationship that the elector has in mind when he walks as a key factor."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the report sent by Terry Breese, business officers in Ottawa on 22 January 2009, that President Barack Obama will prepare for his first cup in Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure the continuation of the Government in the trust vote on the federal budget on the beginning of February, in which Canada will give its first detention after more than one year, which has occurred on account of a relief programme from 30 to 40 billion," describes Breese.
He had no idea that the Government had to take the Parliament's meeting before Christmas to prevent the coalition of the Parliament and the continuation of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed life programme.
Another, dating and on the side of the lawyer Wilkins reported in January 2008, Washington understands the more negative image that the CBC spread dramatic series from the United States.
The messenger is disappointed by sendings such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where we can observe little subtil examples of Maher Arar, "No-fly-list" or also exhibitions for the purpose of the muscle-protects performed.
Another communication is clearly reported on how Hillary Clinten at his French official colleagues Bernard Kouchner at his first bilateral meetings asked whether Europe was ready to stay in certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner would have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of a individual decision on the case.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he made the state secretary a paper in pointo Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim origin."
"The State Secretary has forbidden to review the acts again."
Let's still note that the hosts are hit about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper, a very close adviser, had explained about CBC that the responsibles for this massive Leck should be killed.
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
World Transparency Plan for Renewable Lighting
The UN has proposed a plan in Cancun to renew household, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in gas gas (FCKW), which corresponds to nearly a third of the subsequent reduction that must be achieved to stabilize the earth climate until 2020.
This ambitioned plan takes its position in the steps of the specific large projects that hope to implement the UN in Cancun in order to promote the absence of forced reduction obligations in industrial countries.
According to the yesterday prepared plan, the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the FCKWs delivered to the earth by lighting if the white-breaker birds, which still represent a monopole of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better by light-diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the worldwide emissions.
This corresponds to a equivalent of 70% of the exhausts of the world cargo park.
In Copenhagen the last year, the large exhibitors, such as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, have been committed to voluntary reduction plans that should decrease the global FCKW emissions of 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it was necessary to remove 5 Gt from this bicycle to stabilize the climate growth by 2 degrees of Celsius from today to 2020 to prevent it from control.
In the white-lighting birds, 95% of the energy in the form of heat produces the light.
The complicated complicated fuel sources reduce energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED lightinglines, the energy need is re-reduced by the double.
The complicated hydrogens hold between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED illustrations, such as those who have made Philip's manufacturer this week in the market - this company has also shared in UN study - have a expectation of life of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a whitelighting beverage, which provides an evaluation of the sparing opportunities of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that the outcome of completely new luminosity is only a very little heat, they can also work with a regulatory opposite.
And they don't contain any cheek silver.
Several specialists have shown that compact sources have reserves because they contain checking silver and that they must be removed as a specialmeaning, which is not always possible in the developing countries, other than the products, provide a place of acceptance.
However, the main source of check silver emissions on the planet is not the complicated carbon sources, but the coal powers, which are essentially more cutting silver to generate electricity consumed by white lighting birds.
Only in the United States, these coal powers exhausted 25,000 tonnes of checking silver annually.
The report provides detailed profits that each country would create thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would, for example, compare a billion per year in achieving electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 carbon powers that would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Eleven bones expected to announce election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested the "free" publication of the results of the election election of the eleven coasts directly after their duration.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent election committee to receive their work and to provide the provisional results without further submission," stressed a press speaker of the UN Chairman.
"He requests all parties and institutions of the eleven coasts to be subject to their responsibility and to include each initiative until the provisional results are published."
Despite the pressure performed by certain foreign governments, the election committee had allowed the deadline fixed at midnight three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
Circa forty minutes ago, the President of the CEI in television had assured that the Commission would "continue working" to announce the results.
In the middle of the week, many calls from the world have become sound, but the CEI can finally call the name of the winner of the second election round under the Laurent Gbagbo separate from the office and his opposers Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo story calculates the cancellation of "broke" voting taxes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the former Rebellion of the Forces News (FN) during the failure of the puts in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, leader of the Presidency campaign of the eleven coasts, had noticed that the UN's practiced manovers had feared the president's attachments to the election of the electors in the north of the country.
The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints imposed by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Board.
However, the Gbagbo contractors are now more viewed that the Highest Court of Justice of the country is not neutral, since Paul Yao N'Dre is guided by a politically close associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North, who distracts any connection with the former rebels, has assessed the delay in the publication of election results as "inacceptable" and requested Gbagbo to respect them, even if he hasn't gone so far to request the victory.
His parties confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost; and to make a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the election Commission has prevented the public and illegal results.
The second of the presidential elections on Sunday were held for the crown of the Joint and Conciliation Process of a country divided into two parts over years.
The United Nations had warned the elefant coasts in the middle of the week that they could be held responsible in the case of any exemption for these.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first election round on 31 October with 38% of the votes towards the 32% of Alassane Ouattara, which enjoyed the public support of the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first place) as a spontaneous candidate.
Unemployment rates in France remain stable in the quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the meaning of the International Working Office (IAA) in the Metropole is a stabil 9.3% (including overseas departments to 9.7%) shows the provisional, season-free information published on Thursday by the Statistical Federal Office.
The unemployment numbers in the metropole are based on 2.631 million.
The information of the second quarter is 9.3% of the acquisitive population in the Metropole and 9.7% of the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased 0.1 percentage points.
Income, 3,4 million employees of the French metropole were not employed in the quarter, but wanted to find a job; it included whether they were currently employable every two weeks or not or not.
The situation of young people on the work has been increased by 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percent points within three months, +0.5 percent points over the year) and 25% in the areas of overseas continued to be deteriorated.
In the quarter, 637.000 of the youths between 15 and 24 years of age were unemployment.
The elderly have seen an easily increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropole (+0.2 percent points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of the over 50-year-old persons, 6.6% of the overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years were able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the quarter; 8.3% in the metropole (-0.1 percent over three months, +0.1 percent per year) and 8.8% in France in total.
After a negotiation on its procedures, the Statistic Federal Federal Agency has no longer published the monthly unemployment deficiencies since 2006.
However, Eurostat, the statistical official of the European Union, continued in this method and announced on Sunday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
In contrast with Alexandre Guérini, 53, leader of an insurance form and brother of the President of the Council-General of the Region Bouches-du-Rhône (PS), an investigation procedure was initiated and was invoked in prison in the nearby Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation procedure on the public and under appeal market.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of subsequences of social powers, retention of general guests, hire, middle in corruption, inappropriate appreciation and weapons property, so his legal lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini was prepared for fighting and intended to express himself to all the questions that will be put to him by the Governing Body, instead of spreading the brain penises."
"It is easy to submit him a number of penalty points, another thing is to prove this," explained his legal lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before listening to his man.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialist) in the Department, had valued to allow the judge to make a memorandum to his justification before his hearing by his advocates.
Philippe Rapezzi was also accused and arrested at midweight.
According to law advocate Lucien Simon had never done anything else than to keep his deponie that he had to lead.
With regard to the business competence area or the destination of the fund associated with it, he would never have known, as Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of Ballingra Aubagne, was also accused of submission and complexity on the middle of the middle of the middle of the submission and compliance, but then, under the claim that the protagonists of these acts would be able to stay remote.
"My man was able to give statements to the facts that were before him."
"The leader State lawyer has not taken into account his freedom," said his law lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were accused and were released from prison on Wednesday night, including two of them under legal supervision, such as the Supreme Advocate Michael Raffin.
Michael Karabadjakian, a representative of the Marseille Provence Métropole of the Marseille Metropolis (MPM), is prosecuted due to "unlimited influence and employment".
Two of the state officers of the Payment room Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Brungier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Return and Reserve of General Good by a officer of the public service", the other because of the "medium of public money".
Moreover, the lifemaker by Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of the "healing and submission of social powers".
The persons who were opposed to Guérini belonged to Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently arrested because of a similar case of disgusting powers from public hand that had affected Korsica.
The captives suspected his society to have to wash from "heavy" criminal circles of the coming money.
The survey against X for the cruel distortion of public contracts, in particular in the provisional sector, will be conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the acts of several open investigation procedures.
It is evident that the investigation is particularly related to the conditions of the supplies and the operation of a depony in La Ciotat, which also refers to waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain cities of the State income area of Marseille (MPM).
Affair Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée Palast overlooks its central function for
For more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher held in Iran because of "spionage", the French public in the spirit, replaced the diplomacy in alarm preparation and accompanied the deterioration of relations between Paris and Teheran.
This is all under the attention of the United States diplomats.
The documents received by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the magazine "Le Monde" give some backgrounds of this crisis price.
They describe how the Elysée explained to the Americans his responsibility, which went so far to give these advice to their own crises of "made captures" in Iran (a small group of wagers).
They show how the French responsibility tried to convince Washington that freedom of young French does not have the freezing of Kakavand, a prisoner in France, and a person who is held in prison in France due to trade with material for the Iran nuclear programme.
They set the way the French president tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this the idea believed that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the release of Clotilde Travels in a great light.
In fact, he did nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegraph edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 has the title "Iran: French comments on the way of walking with appeals".
François Richer, Elysée-Braters in question, was discussed in the direction of Patrice Paoli, director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle-East with the Kathleen Allgrone diplomatic.
They told her the French method.
They called the Americans to put everything in order to restore their own citizens who would be arrested violently in Iran.
"Peace bearm," they said, "articulated sound and clear and without submission" the words "Grund human rights", "unschuldige", "successful release" in the media.
This is necessary to introduce the Iranian regime in a disappointment, which is very sensitive to his image.
"Make this more, while the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because "Stilzweigen l'n't anything", over the discussion trials on accidental ways, the Irans are "Masters in Education".
Mr Richier f's point to that the arrest of foreigners is a "periodic, Iranian tactic": "Applause for political pressure".
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was to come on August 16, on the day she fled into the French message) "demands payment of a large amount of money to the Irans" (230,000 euro currency).
And he makes it reliable that the Elysée anti-equips other oil, a phenomenon that "see will be strengthened".
The Irans could "in the near future arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison twelve days ago, but continues to be held in Iran.
An information was carried out: the Iranian Kakavand, whose delivery to the United States on the basis of illegal trade with sensitive electronic material, has been released from prison after a judge in Paris.
The Ananian message is as many other observers, questions about this troubled coincidence.
For Washington, who follows the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the nuclear program, the release of Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France take a kitchen trade in purchasing?
The freedom of the Iranian against the French?
In the case of a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richer assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "a surprise of the decision of the Judge", but also tried to reject it.
"It has made a rain exchange between the French Presidency and the French Justice Minister" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he states.
Mr Richer also wants to point out that Kakavand continues to be under "stark" view of the French secret service.
The Elysée Breater chooses a phone number, restores, informs the Iranian diplomatic, "the Iranian is currently in the buildings led by the Iranian message in Paris".
With regard to Clotilde Reis in Iran, the Elysée does not believe its efforts by providing reliability and the media of organised "flying" the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent middle" role.
The Americans are not watching this A° without ironie and notice that the manipulation brings fruit, since several press articles reflect the official French version.
One telegraph of 25 August 2009 refers to the "Medium Blitch of the French authorities".
On the basis of so many "the testimony" to Mr. Assad, the Paris message asks.
"After their declarations of loving praise, the French authorities encounter secretly that they have only a fair idea of what they have actually done."
The document is so concerned with the reasons that the Elysée has brought to defeat this figure.
The intensive communications efforts "measuring Sarkozys' opening against," he analyzes.
One 2008 launched the "consumed critical votes in France and in the foreign country as frozen and unworthy".
"The Syrian role building" is attempting Paris to lead Syria to the eyes of which beauty can be achieved by playing an active role in the region."
The goal is also to "see the interpretation between seed and Iran".
The news of the Ananias knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richer trusted her: "We don't know whether the more have done anything."
"But we thanked us with them, despite all things."
"This should be at least confusing in the Irans."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in Elysée.
In a communicate, he thanks to the President of Brazil, the Senegal and for its "active role for the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean Government will be determined by a law called "the ash broad", which will prohibit the youths to play after the middle-east online Games by locking their access to such government responsibilities.
A draft law to invite the online players to deny access to these games under 16 years after midnight will be submitted to Parliament in December, drawn representatives of cultural and family ministers.
"Several children play these games all night and have difficulties with learning at school and also to carry out a normal life daily."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin said, with this draft law, betra's Ministerial Officer of the French Presse Agency France Presse.
The online games will be accessible again from 6 hours in the morning.
The producer companies had a long time to prepare for the application of the law for a year.
The Government also makes it possible to ask the manufacturers to subscribe the time limit given for access to these games to the youths whose parents ask for it to add to the responsible.
It will also provide free programs for those who want to provide free time on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "netted" countries, and the newspapers report regularly of various, intensive Internet use-related events.
The country is also an inappropriate campaign in worldwide online game competition.
In November, South Korea, in contrast to 58 other N′, four gold medals in the World Cyber Games.
World Mastership 2018-2022: the FIFA names the judge country
In addition, on the basis of corruption, the Executive Committee of the FIFA on Thursday designates the Governing States of the World Masterships 2018 and 2022, a highest political choice in which the railways of influence and lobbying threaten the technical criteria in the background.
One thing, however, is safe: the morning of 2018 of the King Diselin of the FIFA will be located in Europe, their traditional hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgia).
The decade 2022 will then be exotic; the International Football Conference hopes to continue to be able to win new territory (Katar, ○en) for themselves, or to continue to follow its discharge in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Katar, the Belgian and the Dutch Government, Zidane, Beckham, andyff) provides the measure of the economic and political use of a world mastership.
So the powers behind the cules threatened to keep until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and the Italian (2022) acts provide better arguments than their competitors.
But these advice will not be so weighted for the 22 members of the Executive Committee for the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the enthings with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Themerii and Amos Adamu), could also have been able to destroy the opportunities for their own country, as the football, which only once had the world mastership, namely in 1966.
The BBC again gave neighborhood on Monday by drawing out a documentary report, which takes three influenced members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
The reason enough to envy the FIFA and to bring the English responsibility in an opportunity, which first had committed a intense lobbying with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The Governing Boss hopes for a re-installation of the shock acquired by Previous Tony Blair, which had achieved the Olympical Games 2012 in 2005 for London.
Would this intensive use be sufficient to re-value the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less safe because Duo Spain-Portugal does not miss tromps with his already done stages, his expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympical Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could deteriorate their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the Englands and the doubts about Spain and Portugal have increased the possibilities of Russia, which has become a weighty outside, despite its loops in the register (stages, hotels, transports).
The Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to claim the unusual adversity to the opinions of the English press "injust competition in the preparation of voting" from the members of the Committee.
"You're getting her with a shit, trying to compromise her," put Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by 1994's experience, seem to be logical favorites.
The first economic power of the world, the seat of the FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to show a long list of advantages to Japan and South Korea which have set a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidates seem to be frozen for two countries who have joined the legal fights in 2002.
Another threat: the approved authorisation of the WM 2026 of the FIFA for China, which allows the Asian chances to fall on 2022.
With the expectation of futureistic stages, the FIFA follows its extension towards new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk because it is awareness.
Similarly, Japan and South Korea may suffer under the weakness of television rights accepted by the countries (from the time test), the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
Second mandate: publicity
The Gaulle was really kidding.
The middle side had believed he was short.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the lowest pool.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is still less than this.
A mandate in Elysée calls the next one.
The current head of the state will therefore be the candidate in 2012.
But the openness is the side of the mystery, which is arrested by the presidential function, not well faced.
So you have to do as if there is a doubt.
In one, as well as in the other sense.
2006 the Joint Jacques Chiracs suggested that a mandate was not excluded without self-believing.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy severely assured his decision to take "at any time in the inheritance of 2011".
That he would allow the "two mandates" perspectives in Elysée before the UMP parliamentaries on the day of service, he would have spread a little feverability.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
It's very different.
The Chairman only reminded that the change in the Constitution of 2008 was due to the number of five-year office periods only to two.
He made a detection, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he takes the presidency election of such meetings in a humorous tongue.
"It's the worst case that you've got seven and half years with me, or, if it's best," he explained to them in July 2009.
A new in May 2010: "Don't believe I'm not thinking about the phase after it."
His words from before it make him no longer as candidate than in the morning; but not less.
If they should make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the run around the candidate with the PS on one side.
But it is not the introduction of the competition with Segoléne Royal, the Nicolas Sarkozy, to show itself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidate in 2012, which encourages many members of the PS more early than accepted to fighting.
The bad questions on the other hand.
For the first time, the right electors would provide a candidate from François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP about it," the Prime Minister responded directly and carefully.
"If he had a download as possible, he wouldn't be candidate," Jean-Pierre shared Raffarin.
"He will always believe that he can win," Alain Juppé corrects, who has found himself openly.
Euro: The ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of State papers
The last assembly of the ECB's central bankkrate in the past year should provide opportunities to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce a large number of unconventional measures of the money policy to reach the end of the year.
The crisis of the State debt implies that the Central Bank in Frankfurt cannot, of course, be able to make it possible, also to affect the present, more than stressed situation on the investment forces, in order to avoid deteriorating them.
The political costs would be too high.
The French Financial Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed a press conference yesterday the role taken by the ECB for the solution to the European State budget debt.
It has not expected to say if she thinks that the Central Bank can do more, for example by encouraging her program for the purchasing of State liabilities.
"I keep my advice for my trade partners..."
Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the ECB, had not expressed his opinion in Brussels on the previous day by the Economic and Electoral Committee of the Parliament, but was more important to indicate that the programme of purchase of state papers on the secondary would be "forwarded" and that we will "see the decisions" in the congregation on Thursday.
Single consciousness: The ECB will not change its guideline at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the obligation sales of the tax rooms were duplicated by the ECB last week to approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of some traders, they would have made new buyers on Irish and Portuguese State papers yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have made buyes of 67 billion euro since May 2010.
Under the traders, the anti-equipment of a purchasing rate will not be doubted (see page 29).
The people are already expecting a significant change in the course.
If the investment operations of over three months are already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latest will be to create the unlimited funding reserves in freedom for a period of one week to three months.
The people are already inclined to extend this action in a few months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a significant way."
"In other cases, she would take the risk of provoking new spending in short view," Michael Schubert, the Communication Bank's Volkswirt.
"A progressive progressive growth for the first quarter of 2011 seems to me more likely," anticipates Norbert Brams, peopleswirt in Sal.
Uppenheim.
In the field of its interventions on the market of State debt, the ECB "reserved a purchase volume to Oblig" to add Norbert Brams.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of the banks on the state debt markets in the Eurozone, the Central Bank has no choice other than to maintain its presence on the market.
"They must come to the places of the lack of investors on the market and act in order to prevent the prejudice of the rents paid to the Swiss States," a major oblig’s inheritance yesterday.
Because if the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the airplane, the states would be further prevented from reducing or stabilising their debt.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Government of Berlusconi goes to Italy in covering
After a weighting beginning for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday with the decrease of the equcines to 10 years.
A back to the thirsty silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Ministry of Economics, the President of the Regions Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "unnumberable" and heard him with an "unpredictable" weekend, which, however, deminated immediately.
On Wednesday, it would have reached its record of 210 basic points, and the prices of the contracts on the covering of the competition risk would have increased to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi noted at the Ministerial Council that Spain's discrepance was at 400 basic points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "severely concerned" by the "market turbulences" and a possible driving from Ireland.
"The message is that Italy, the population economy of the Eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, Popswirt at Hudson Institute.
In the original text it is that its problem is the absency of economic growth and the incoming, wind-free tax income that brings the State into no more to cover its financing needs.
The last brossel prognoses were a cold dusche for the government.
The future will be expected a Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... despite that the budget for the session is estimated by 1.3% with 2%.
Under these conditions, as calculated by the EU Commission, the budget debt will be 4.3% of the BDP in the next year (instead of 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (place 2.7%).
Therefore, the caller for a new budget collective, which could be set up to a sum of 7 billion euros after the feet.
"When necessary, new spare measures must be taken," says economic inspector O© Rehn.
In the hour, Italy receives support for international institutions.
"The basic festivals of the Italian economy are fine and its accounts are regulated, which we have repeated for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, the Italian wheels of the International Value Fund, which has been cared for IWF with Italy.
"In the present there are no problems, not short-term or long-term, since Italy has demanded less stability progress than other countries, despite its high debt (119.2% of the PIB in 2011, A.D.R.)," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD's leader.
Remember the question of political integrity.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face an incredible request from the lawyer's room, which would have been organized by the previous elections already ended March.
It is therefore a little favourable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the development of anticrisis measures:
Christine Lagarde had expressly highlighted it last night in a press conference in Paris: "I think it was still shown on Sunday afternoon and evening: the Europeans are clearly together, ready and committed to defend their walls and their election area."
Although perfectly related - the decline to the rates of the State obligations yesterday was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, from a beginning of normalisation it may not be the talk yet.
The Rating Agency Standard & Poor had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt mark, which is the most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May there is a real lack of clarity and political sensitivity which is particularly on banking systems," the opinion of the Exaneous BNP Paris peoples.
In particular, "the political time goes much slower than the markets".
The countries, which are well-known both of these and of those in which it is aware, intensify the debates to strengthen existing anticrises.
The informal consultations between the ministries directly affected and further with their opposers of G20 are in progress.
And this is also regarding the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings in the beginning of the next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the plan, the loss of the unconventional measures to reinforce the euro zone countries in the market cross (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Fund, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started its Asian tour on Sunday in Singapore to inform investors in Fernost about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his search is not an explicit funding, he will certainly prepare the ground for this.
The first advertising paper expenditure from the EU Stability Fund shall be provided for for the next month.
Yesterday, a official representative of the Agency Reës had trusted that the United States supported a possible increase in the social, direct commitment of the IWF mobilised fund.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first range, are entitled to adopt structural reforms, in particular in the field of the organization of work.
Reforms that are to reach the safeguard measures, however, should show effects in the closer future.
Lissabon and Madrid have described a different way than this Greece and Ireland.
One, as well as the other, is to avoid any price, to ask for international assistance before they have set up their own budget correctives and decided over inappropriate structural reforms that continue to restore their confidence.
The capital providers continue to discuss the options available to accelerate the normalization process of the markets of State loans.
Axel Weber, who was on the travel to Paris on 24 November, first had shown the idea that if the 750 billion euros which were mobilised by Europe and the International Value Fund were not enough, the Union would not leave to take it again.
The peoples of Barclays Capital, as regards the market of the State debt of the actor's entirely based, judge, would prolonge about 100 billion euros, "previously" in the form of a direct liquidity price.
This fund exists: the mechanism of dotated financial stability, currently 60 billion euros.
A Council with all opportunities to be carefully examined in the main towns.

Snow and glace: 24 departments in alarm level Orange
The snow episodes still take difficulties, especially in the secondary networks of the bretagne, and threaten to affect various economics.
Twenty-four departments are now in the alarm level of oranges due to the threatening risk of snow and glass.
The regions Your, Your-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have reached 20 departments already in the alarm level of Orange; 18 departments since midnight and two, Dordogne and Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Meteo France, the intensive snow viewers touch the north of the Girondes and the Charentes, easily cut it on the Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow coverages are expected from 2 to 5 cm, mostly from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The areas of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandia, Ile-de-France and Limousin are concerned.
The snow cases are carefully enough to cause disturbances and to affect certain economies, says Météo France.
In the region Côtes d'Armor, several regional roads are locked over 7.5 tonnes, including Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brie-Loudéac.
The situation of the secondary transmission networks in the Bretagne is very difficult, as stated by the depreciators who were able to use their own vehicle only in the case of need, and the use of some TER travel buses has been driven over the entire day.
In the Picardie, school traffic was canceled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for in the middle of the middle-aged.
The prefecture "requests the car driver to higher care on the streets and to adapt their conduct accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aircraft (DGAC) invited the flight companies to stop 25% of their Paris Airport Roissy on Thursday and 10% of the flights started by Orly due to the expected strong snow accidents.
The DGAB recommends the flight passenger to contact their flight company.
The Gatwick Airports in the south of London and the airports in Edinburgh, Scotland, have been locked until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial skits
Since the debate on the modernization of the economy on Ile-de-France is fully dealing with billions.
At least in the debates.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris are called in memory to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead the building of the SGP into the ways, the State has called for a capitaldatation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would so allow to grant the markets a share of the financial sums to double their markets.
Today it has come to the first high.
The supplementary budget of 2010, as regards the financial committee of the National Assembly on this morning, contains the measures provided for in order to introduce the first part of these money.
This is two different measures: the creation of a special tax for the exemption and a strict taxation of the offices in Ile-de France.
First, as the article 15 of the Law draft is adopted, "for the public-lovened assembly Société du Grand Paris".
"The product of this tax is about 117 million euros per year."
Second, it is a reorder of the already existing company taxation: "to modernise it to increase the product from its product and to transfer this increase of the Société du Grand Paris".
How many would it take?
It's a crap.
This sum is not interested in the text.
From the 4 billion, you're far away.
"The tax resources will be calculated to the 4 billion euros of the capitalaldatation imposed by the State and made by the Société du Grand Paris after and after the project."
The SGP does not find this system anxious.
"From the time in which income is recorded (the two taxes, R.), you can cover the projecting for three years and then create only from 4 billion," it is explained.
"This will be noted in the budget and after and after."
The SGP suggests that 2013 will be started to note 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This action which four billions of promised will be able to be searched for for a long time is going to take up a rightly moved and parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be located on 7 December.
Racked hackers and emissuous spies
The WikiLeaks Affairs has a double importance.
On the one hand, she has become a manifest scandale, a scandale, which is only a scandale in the Sinner seenness that rules the relationship between States, citizens and press.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes at international level, and gives a pleasure to the future dominated by regression.
But we're going to go through the row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the activation of the fact that every act created by a secret service (a x-big nation) is composed of a periodic exhibition.
The "extraordinary", ananical enthings about the sexual habits of Berlusconis reject nothing more than what you have been reading over months, as well as in every x-beliable journal (excluding those whose owner is Berlusconi) and the terrifying kariculated profile Gaddafis has already offered Kabaret artists a long time a substance for their sketch.
The rule that the secret folders can be consistent only from already news is essential for the dynamic of the secret services, not only in this century.
If you go into a library that is dedicated to the istheric public, you will recognize that every work (over the Gral, the mystery of Rennes-le-chateau, the Templer or the Rosen Crossler) is exactly what has been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts doesn't want to publish research (therefore he didn't know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occultism believe nothing other than what they already know and know what they have learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Like the secret acts.
The informant is faul, and the faul (or restricted spirit) is also the head of the secret service (if he could be anything, for example, the editor in Libération), who only meets as true what he recognises.
The top secrets about Berlusconi, which had sent the news message in Rome to the state dezernate, were the same as those who had already been newsweek in the week earlier.
Why, then, has such an exhibition been made about the enthing processes of these folders?
On one side, those who know what each person already knows, and even though the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since the Governing Boss can call on each other or take a flight to meet the dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have transformed themselves, with the exception of some small representative tasks, to spionage ́re.
Each looker of research films knows this very exactly, and it does not happen from evidence that you do so to ignore this.
However, the fact that to repeat it publicly deteriorates the task of clearness and serves to put the diplomatic in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a x-beauty hacker can cross the secrets of the most powerful country in the world is the great fight against the prestigious state dezernate.
Moreover, the scandale brings less sacrifices than the "scarry" in trouble.
But let us dedicate ourselves to the deep-based nature of what is done.
Earlier, in Orwell's days, all powers could be bound as a big brother who controlled every geste of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy would have been able to be perfectly correct since it was possible to control any movement by the phone, every active transaction, the visited hotel, the selected car, and so further; the citizen would be to the total sacrifice of the power's eyes.
But if you look at what is happening today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape from the control of a hacker, the control will stop to be aligned on the side and become circle-formed.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as a citizen, can bring the secrets of the power.
How, though, can a power that is no longer able to keep his own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is a empty secret (and a empty secret can never be enthôned); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkels in fact is a secret free from secrets because it is the public speech praisgi; but in the style of WikiLeaks, the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to exercise any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor marks wrong but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this restriction that has been granted to such a mighty power?
It is obvious that the states will have no more information available in the future - that would be equal to an extent attached to the road neck.
But it is also evident that it is forgiven with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and whether a State boss moved in a flight and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private relations be discussed in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my predict at the moment of science-fiction and romantic sounds, but I see I need to imagine the government agents in a secret way moved into uncontrolled march routes, in no way other than in the only memory, and in addition the few written information they have received in the shadow.
The information would be stored in one copy in closed shoppings: in fact, the spying trial of Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is currently progressing as a cancer, namely backward.
One centurie after the untrusted telegraph had revolutionated the communication, the Internet rebuilds a telegraph with (telephone) draft.
The (analogs) video cassettes had allowed the film researchers to exhaust a film band for bands by splitting from back to front and all the secrets of the mounting, while the (numeric) CDs today allowed nothing but to run from chapter to chapter, so in macroportions.
The high speed drives are moved within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires three and half hours by a flight.
It is therefore not exceptional that and communication technology return on cars and horses.
A last observation.
In ancient times, the press tried to understand what was avoided for mysteries between the messages.
Currently, it is the message that requires confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France has spoken of his financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty is time to investigate the fulfillment of the rapidly resolved financing promises (a.k.a. "Fast Start" or frozen financing) made by the developing countries.
And the gross French beauty are already discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have been binding to provide 30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has charged 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (e.g. 420 millions per year).
In the case of COP16's vote, the EU has made all the rulers to convince their partners of their commitment in relation to fast-start financing: detailed procedure report of their Member States, press conference, major emergency, brochure distribution.
The transparency of the operation is noteworthy and a degree of appreciation for its value: the developing countries and the civil society would like to see it if all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that in 2010, it has released 2.5 billion euros, which brings it on the right way to respect its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and social" to ensure that an additional use has been introduced without providing public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consciousness about what "new and social" means.
As the Commission proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the correct value that he considers the best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen as a direct value for those in 2009: international funding will be maintained, and it provides for the financing of the "Fast Start" for over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar direct values, either for year or for conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France believed that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 was "new and later".
Otherwise: There are no correct values in the statements of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Specificly, the total amount of French support for developing countries may remain stable (or reduce) - France suggests to carry out its commitment in respect of the "new and social" funding.
Another, decision-making element is the decryption in S.A. and loans.
There is no rule on it, and everyone chooses its calculation mode.
Some such as France, for example, are 1 € supplied as equivalent to 1 rented €.
It is obvious that this is only difficult: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain rentable investments (eighty-fold projects related to emission recovery based on more effective technologies), it is crucial to present the euro that is equivalent to an equivalent to a costed euro... it should also be calculated only the costs of the loan for the capital grant country as an engagement (e.g. the equivalent of an interest).
But France has nothing different in the meaning of the following consideration: it "respects" its obligation of 420 million euros by 91.5% loans (389,8 million euros) and spent 8.5%) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country of the EU that loans are largely employed.
Germany requests 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including otherwise) follow their commitments to 100% with S.
Otherwise, if the major major majority of the European Union expires 1 euro to the inheritance of their obligations, France just gives 10 cents and understands a comparable use.
Nice hooks!
All in general, France operates in its fixed start finance with a double-suck: in part with further development of the action on the time and in other part with the reality of the financial use.
France is able to believe that it has issued 420 million "new and social" millions in accordance with its promise and saves 36.1 million euros.
The Manipulation of the Financial Ministry (as it seems to be Bercy who has been carrying out the workshop) could have a double negative effect; once within the EU (why do the other Member States continue with the sight, if it is to be done?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely disturbing...
The chapter of the frozen financing is only a small question of relatively short time, compared to the total debates on climate.
But it could be too much of the troops in the vast machinery of UNFCCC.
Let's hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn his lesson from the first year of refrigerated financing.
In particular, France could announce an amendment to its type of booking for the years 2011 and 2012, even in the spirit of the respect for its obligations and the equilibration of justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could lead to the debates on the conflict of long-term financing (another, decision-making and currently discussed issue): the question of the "compensability" or the type of rebuilding of its loans is not addressed.
France could change its position in order to be progressively regarding conflict issues as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Ministry of Environment Kosciusko Morizet, which will take place next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement of the fast start of France and its vision of "recoverability" and the use of loans from nature from the international confidence base that is necessary for further discussions.
Alert - Pesticide taken by Children
A 10-year-old child takes different chemicals over the day 81, as published by the Generations Futures Unit (earlier movement to protect the rights and respect of the coming Generation).
The association, which explains that its results "from the small number of analyzed samples not play statistically significant value, but represents illustration characters of the treated problem" used to cook the food consumed within four years of July and September to feed a period of intermediate food in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical feeds - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit, three milk products and 1.5 liter water per day - were also studied in search for chemical substances, pesticides, fat metals and other damage substances.
The Tellerbi is lowerly: 81 chemicals, including 42 likely or probably cancerous and five as safe carcigen class, as well as 37 substances with endokrinin-secto factor, are some of the institutions such as the International Cancer Research.
"If in the closer total of the cases the legal limits for any chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, this is, however, very well assumed that the reality in which the consumption may be exposed to cancer substances or substances with endocrin-sq factor is anxiety," notes the union.
Only the butter and the tea with milk are already more than ≥ the possible cancer residues and three safe as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormon system.
The appel imported from Brazil, as a provision for intermediate feeding, shows tracks of six chemical substances, including a forbidden fungide in France.
The same applies to the green bones of Kenya, including at midnight, where the tracks of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU have been detected.
Moreover, the hacksteak, the tunfish from the books, even the baguette and the cowgummi of pesticides and other chemical substances were also sprayed.
In the leading water, the analysis made the presence of nitrates and chloroforms light.
At dinner, the lach steak with 34, chemical residues was detected at "the richest" and even the plastic plastic used to warm up in the microwave.
The final risk of this "cocktails" for consumers is probably undervalued, as it is.
The "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV) proposed, on its side, "with regard to the difficulty of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "creasing of civilization diseases".
In July, a number of European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has identified the presence of 365 residues of different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in grains.
