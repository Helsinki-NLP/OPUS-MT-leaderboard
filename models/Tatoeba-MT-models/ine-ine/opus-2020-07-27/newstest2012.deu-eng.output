No free Novelle for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament denied today the request to reject those paragraphs under a Novell of the Court of Justice, on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was condemned.
In the second reading of the request for mildness of the penalties for economic delegates, the new scheme that could have been able to avoid the way to release the arrested expert minister.
Timoshenko was condemned in October because of the conclusion of an appealing contract with Russia on the acquisition of Earth Gas to seven years of prison.
The sentence is not yet legal; the vocation of the sentences shall be negotiated in December.
Timoshenko himself considers the judgment as a political decree of the Regime, and also in the west, the proceedings made the decree of the presence of the Court.
The request for paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Minister of Expresion was sentenced to remove from the Court of Justice, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary to accept it.
Libyan Victoria
The history of the Libyan Liberation War or Libyan Rebellion already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the wilderness and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As this region usually wins in the elections of islamists, the question is only what - the advised or the radical.
The National Transitional Council is to be the customs right of the Scharija, of which you now have a certain view of God.
Libya would go to the country without criminality, because for a dead steel, it was shortly cut off the hand.
Moreover, women should forget Eman's thinking as quickly as possible, and so further.
Instead of one single dictator, the society will be given by the Coran out of each other's tribes.
Shortly - in Libya, there will be a order that would not be imaginable and especially unnecessary.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively seen as well as the best, and the decline would not be able to match the libyers.
It is rather appealing that the Moslem warriors have been helped by the unbelieving dogs.
Their excuse may be only the fact that NATO's air attacks were not led by any general of America, but by God himself, whose Almighty was praised after every step.
The winners in Libya?
We only participated in a shift of shooting, served the interests of the Islam, and our members devoted themselves to the person of the dictator of a political union without any benefit.
According to the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we would like to have seen a military occupation in Libya.
This causes the hiesigens to be anxious, namely the deliverance of the cross carriers.
But do the mineral oil enterprises also receive the black gold without occupation to the spot price?
The west can finally glorify his independence in matters of protection of human rights.
If this doesn't destroy them the representatives of Sharía.
Start of a new crisis era
France and Europe's focus on investors.
On Wednesday, a statistical storm fell through Europe.
The individual States published their information about their PIB for the third quarter.
The Czech economy was stagnated in comparison with the prequartal, Germany and France.
Today, however, the obligation is traveling all records.
The investors are not only in Greece but also in Spain, France, Austria and other eye countries.
The statistical officers of the European Zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other countries published their provisional forecasts on economic development in the quarter.
The BIP of Germany expected to grow with 0.5%, which was 0.4% from France.
Both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany had a growth, as originally expected (in 0.3% of growth predicted by 0.1%), while France cleared a easily decrease of 0.1% (essential information was only spoken of Stagnation).
The Czech economy increased by 1.5 Pro in this year's quarter in comparison to the previous year.
However, in comparison to the prequartal, the Brutto-Inland product was stagnated and the statistical office, according to the trend of the growth of economic efficiency renewable.
Thus, the results are worse than the analysers' predicts.
The main events:
However, the Czech economy increased by 1,5 Pro in comparison with the previous quarter.
According to provisional and seasonally calculated information, the German economy in the quarter increased by 0.5 pro.
In the entire euro zone and in the EU, the economy has increased by 0.2 per cent between July and September to the previous quarter, which corresponds to the expectations of the analysers.
In comparison with the previous year, the Greek economy broke about 5,2 Pro.
The pensions from their 10-year state liabilities reveal the value of 28.45%.
The pensions of the Italian and Spanish State Limits increased to their critical limits.
In addition to Austria, the Netherlands, France, France and other countries, begin to face problems...
The pensions in the Czech State assets are less than 4%, even if the situation in the region is deteriorated.
In Germany, the ECB is to become the believer of the last institution.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football choice has made the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-saving Torwarts Czech and a glorious port of Petr Jiráček, they won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of lucky, the Czech football could so defend its luxuous precept from the home game and will not again fall in the European Mastership.
IHNED.cz followed the growing game in an additional reporting.
A little exciting in the first half-time and a riesen portion happiness in the second.
The Czech election also seemed very happy for the conclusions of the homemanship, a constant Czech and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro 1:0 and thus solved her ticket for the football-EM.
Moreover, because of the precise defence game of the Czech community, they put the Montenegriners more under pressure in the second half-time.
The pech birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who broke two rice chances.
In addition, thanks to a great Petr Czech, the Czech election will be mixed in the European Masterships next year, it is also happy that the home football is added to a premium of about 200 million.
Since the first minutes, a lot of fighting football was played.
Both men were combined long-termly and so was played in particular around the middle line.
Moreover, in the second half-time, the pressure of the homemanagement remained expired, and the great deficiencies before the strawflow were decreased by the Czech refusal.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of high school students formed a living shield around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the nuclear programme of their country before a possible Israelic attack.
The students prayed on Wednesday Wednesday before the object and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students of the University in Iranian Isfahan formed a living shield around the corner in Isfahan, in which the Uran will be devoted.
They wanted to make sure that they were ready to get the nuclear programme of their country, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has recently stated in its report that Iran has not seemed to have been abandoned by his efforts on a nuclear weapons long.
In Israel it is also spoken of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear systems.
Students prayed before the income to the complex on midnight and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack in the aim of putting the Iranian atom programme largely, the Israeli pressure from the center in Isfahan would also be the atomical atomic installation for Natan's attack target.
The food card of a fat child: it doesn't eat and eat to dinner bread
More than one third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 per percent of all children.
Current inquiries - Adipous children are most of families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important it is for the healthy development of a person the environment in which it is raised and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipous children, worsts are more frequently on the table than in families where normal weight children live.
More than 19% of the overweighting children had on the morning of the closing action under the "Adi ́as is not a case" Pommes for the evening bread.
In families with dickerchen, sports are also not just related to favorite jobs, but the majority of today's students - only 15% replied that their parents were at least once in the week for active movement.
Question under 900 children
The survey was found last year at the end of the school year, and nearly 900 children were asked from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the action "Adi ́as is not a case", which is supported by the General Hospital Case and the Unilever Society.
To this end, more than 12 thousand students shared in the project from 4 and 8 classs.
Unhealthy cost and missing movement in the family are decision-making ones responsible for the terrible number of children with overweight or even fat.
"Only the half of the questioned children, for example, led five times a day to eat dinner bread in the breakfast-to-feeding mode - one of the main conditions for a healthy nutrition," is one of the results of the investigation.
No breakfast and wheat for dinner bread
Experts indicate that relative minorities, such as the regular breakfast of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In Czechland, however, only 23 per percent of the students' families.
And - in most families, everyone gets alone.
The worst was the finding that in each family that is not in any family was not too distressed.
The breakfast applies to the foundation of the healthy daily nutrition.
The investigation test included the day that overweight children are consumed much more healthy pommes in the families.
And almost everyone - without regard to weight - drinks sweet limonates every day (70 Pro).
More than 40% of the children concerned about sports, but only less than the help of their parents do so - is only 15%.
Build your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), to gather themselves with their own food plans from offered opportunities and opinions.
"What Czech Children prefer between 12 and 15 in pointo Ernäh, is far away from the ideal of a healthy nutrition.
Under their favorite vessels, there were many meals, meat courts, and of course sweet meat.
"Alarmant is, in particular, the great population of sweet limonates," is pointed out in the final report on this survey.
At dinner, so the main court, the tissue was soon in front of the birds.
Wood fruits were almost unlike the children, and the belief of fish and vegetables were very low as breakfast.
Health and health
At the same time, the investigation also showed that the children were ready to change their food habits if they had the right information.
"In the control group of investigators, who were issued the questionnaire after the conclusion of the "Adi ́as is not a case" reported in many cases, a clear movement of the preferenties to the principles of healthy nutrition has been indicated in the results of the project.
This was, for example, in the sweet Limos, where many children began giving the priority to usual water.
The children also crossed in the questionbogue a lot of birds or fish as the headquarters of the day and were ready to eat less nodes or sweet food.
Appreciate Professor - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the beginning article about how to learn stylists, I had a little guess that it was a little too much substance for the beginning.
I didn't know what else happens.
Subjects of three professionals from the branch, clothing of problems figures and a seminar about how it works "in the place".
It's gonna be worse.
The more closer is the test, so much more information and practical tasks are before us.
But even if the course is located every Saturday and Sunday, it is still complete.
This time, we discussed with Directora Alena (in the course no one is involved) as to a woman who has no ideally proportionate figure.
And that's always the most of us.
One has one too short hair, the other one too young figure without ordinary curves and others are mole.
It is a thing of the stylist to optically cut wide rows, to extend the hair or to pull the needed curves.
We also got tips of how to touch a woman type such as Jennifer Lopez - so with big buses, wide shoes, and smal sizes - beautiful and figur beton, without being too provocated.
For example, if the subdivision between the taille and the halls is so large that the rock or the woods really do not match, at least a piece should be cut into measure.
This will certainly not be repentant, because well-seated clothing is simply unpaid.
In such a measured rock, you feel much better than in one of the stones that always is too high and disturbed, in the size, etc.
Young figures can be allowed to be clothed with falts, bathrooms, apps, sticks or raffling.
With this lot of information and image types, I am glad that I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my head.
Yet, I realized that it was almost not to be created in view of the open home job.
Each of the students has been assigned a promi for which they have to reflect on the outfits - daily clothing and avendrobe.
We should take into consideration the current appearance, the style of the relevant star and its type of figure.
I'm going to "attract Miranda Kerr", which you may know from the Victoria's secret campaign.
Inside, I jumble, for it is personally better for me than to draw Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently increased to the hundreds of kilo (that is a little overwhelming) or also the young Selena Gomez.
We want to cut out the clothes or search on the Internet, print and then edit graphically.
In "moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our entire personal style and our relationship with the graphical design will be expressed.
It is, in fact, very important to think about the graphical side of Stylings.
The styllist is not only pure physically, but also designed the product page in the journals (by specific default, such as trend hands, mantels, etc.).
Davon told us the Stylist and Designer Mario Kamennik.
But that's the first Sunday.
That means that a styllist must have a good overview.
The Saturday proposal related to information on the types of figures was equal to three of the bills of the branch:
by the stylist Jan Pokorny, by the Creator of Jakub Polanka and by the photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that it is illusion and that it should be able to use this.
And inhibited styllist can work with a single clothing piece in a very different way.
The tuberculosis calls variability.
For example, a trenchcoat can be used as used over the Jeans, so like a T-shirt or a mantel, but you can also draw it on the naked body, dressing it and clothing it as clothing.
It's enough to cross the arms or the powers, and the whole look looks very different.
"Play it," he stressed.
In most cases, the Council said to me: "You must first know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can hurt them first," Jakub said.
Finally, I realize why all of these teachings should be paid to what you can associate with and why, even if you are often seeing all other things in journals.
From looking too quiet.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a styllist has to have prepared much more clothes than he finally photographed.
So you need to be prepared for a fashion story with a page (sprich → Outfits) for at least five.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories seems very different than in reality.
Thus, all of this must be considered in the form of the outfit.
That image and style inside the helps of the success, which also affected us Jan Pokorny.
So only once Madonna needed to see a song who had made a world star from the image and marking.
In Czechland, the service of a stylist is better reserved.
In addition to personalities, this often holds out for money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look like it is secondary).
And if any of us is already allowed, we should consider that he or she will force us with great probability a very different (small) size than he or she actually wrapped.
Then it was only needed to go up to find out that the Boulevard press is written, which the corresponding promi has rebuilt or removed, etc.
Jan and Mario put us in the heart on Sunday not to believe that a stylist was focusing on the face and then the output was "building".
In his work, he must communicate, especially with the people who make it, and he must be a psychologist.
People appreciate without offering themselves and standing according to their opinion.
"If any manager commands us to see her clothes and to add beautiful pieces, we can't clean her all the pain and say, "My God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can do," said Mario.
He also showed us exactly what must include such a "local" box.
So a bag that is knipped at the size and wear all the necessary properties.
Except clear things, such as scarlets, scarlets for hair dilution or safety snakes, they also contain outensiles such as a nilofade (as helping the stylist to photograph products such as hands or cups), special clips with which the clothing is drawn behind if it is too large (scale or other sticks are overwhelmed so that the substance can not be cut off) and, of course, the neck.
But not only to listen to, but also to try something practically, we learned how to highlight shoes rightly.
Even when photographing in the athlete, where the foot is right, you can protect the shoes, weigh the outside.
We're closing and closing...
You can't even touch the shoes so that you can't hurt it.
So you really have to go forward.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
This is not just my strength.
All this was only the breakdown of what we heard at the second weekend-continuation course.
One thing has become clear between me - to dedicate to the staling at a professional level is not a child game.
V Need for Speed: "The" - the illegal running thatr through America
Rezension
The originally unprecedented trip becomes a series of completely preventive, dilettant errors on the rooting to the breakfast.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large part, what does this benefit if no one obviously wanted to do a little more.
Before he came to the ladentic, the new part raised high expectations with the "The" subtitle.
But he promised that the old "Need for Speed" game series to move again a piece into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed not only to be one of many action playing games.
We were also interesting in how the fitted passengers appear in which the main protagonist ascends from the car and continues.
But as you are already used in NFS, there is a lot different in the end effect than you had expected.
Certainly - potentially it is quite anxious arcade running, but at all, the game of some overflow mistakes that are present in this series for more or less than a few years.
So there are no errors anymore, but rather signs of an in the Prince incomprehensive failure of the player developers.
The adventure starts very well.
The first time you are introduced into the story, whose main figure Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to be shared in illegal trends or through America.
In San Francisco, so at the West Coast, you are sitting at the linerad - with the task to be first in New York.
The fundamental idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire road is divided into → steps and in more than fifty individual runs.
This means that each run will be exhausted in other segments and that the individual steps will be located in a different, quite different and interesting environment.
You don't have the impression that the game would always offer the same again.
Some environments are still nice to view, although the technical level of the graph does not exceed the previous parts of the series.
So no world moves.
But the road through the wilderness, by the landscape or above by the deep-skined landscape is visiblely very pleasant.
In and back, untypical elements bring a little difference in the individual runs.
For example, in the wilderness, a wilderness is surprised by a wilderness storm that is strongly limited to the vision.
In the mountains again, you must be careful that you don't be cut off by a lawine.
Besides, the individual runs are very well built behind each other.
Just a few, but they're doing it.
Sometimes you are trying to overcome the previously written number of enemies (in Prince a classic run), then you have time to recover (classical running against the stoppower), then you expect another personal dull with a single contrast.
And that's the police that wants to mix the whole thing.
A new news is passages where Jack leaves the car.
It is rather about certain interactive animations in which Jack flys before someone and where the player needs to help him by using the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprised that there is much less of such passports in the game than you would expect (only three).
Finally, this thing is more beneficial, because this element has at least no chance to become long-term - it belongs to the elements that make the game more differentious.
The train model runs into the foot-ups of the previous parts.
That means, from today's point, it doesn't appear to be trees, but, on the other hand, it could not be said that it would be bad.
Whoever looks for realistic simulations must be looking at where elsewhere.
But an action-loaded road will continue to be fully justified, although the competition could be better.
So far, everything's in the best order.
True problems arise only after a certain time.
In contrast to the vehicle model, the collision model is not completely OK.
From a game of this kind it is rare to expect that it calculates complex deformation and collisions, but if you practically do not have any idea of how the car does, it is obviously not all right.
Typical example: In some places, in other, almost the same situation, you are going into the swimming and rotating wild pirouetes.
Or the car runs to shrott.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't do anything more, but it's always terrible.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or are landing far off the streak, then a game returns to the last stop point of the streets.
Only - in every run, you have only five restarts.
If you have shot them, everything goes out of the front.
Thus, the restarts are more like a tool, in the case that something doesn't succeed, but you should not like to leave it.
Sometimes, however, the restart does not even help, there is nothing but learning the critical section from the head.
Speaking is uncomfortable that the same things are often in the same places.
Some curves, for example, must be conducted in a very specific way, elsewhere you simply do not fit.
Otherwise, "civil" cars are always met at the appropriate place in the same configuration, no matter whether you come as the first or five, five seconds before or a minute later.
This is particularly dangerous in situations when you see that the counterpart is going to pass before a playing two autos, but until you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you need to kill or break them.
And it doesn't matter when it comes there, everything is so conceived that it always comes close to this situation before your nose.
The counterparts have more benefits.
In the entire game, there are some places where you always are overtaken at the same place from the same enemy and here again without looking at the time.
At the most crazy, this is to finish the game on the long bridge that you're faced in the opposite.
The opposite must obviously overcome one here on the devil.
And if he's already in front of one, then he's going to take a view of a person, so you're starting to drive your own car a few times in a clomp.
Of course - you want the game simply stressing and more exciting but this purpose is so clear that it disappears quickly with the joy of the game.
And that's damage, because despite a simpleer train model, the game is totally comprehensive and, probably, also so loaded, that you almost don't know where one of the heads is.
And in Prince, it doesn't matter what it is "faith" - the concept with fifty unique routes, the order of running in a way that no longer-flow can come, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the car change during the running.
You can't oversee the tanks at the streak, because right here you can change the car, though in most cases the car you have right now.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suitable for the urban areas, the strong-anan limousines for the right cars and exotic super-sport cars for the technical vehicles, for example on the serpentines in the mountain.
Manually in hand with the mode of the game history is also the task mode (requests) - so running into the individual locations you know from the history.
There are not only medals, but also experience points for the own profile, which is jointly for tasks (requests) and history.
To reach the driver level, various items must be included: start from the car to the background of the profile.
This is linked simultaneously to the online function Autolog, which, inter alia, compares its own results with which other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible snitzers is a situation in the last run of the history.
Here you come with the car in a U-Bahn tunnel (minet cause), where you are in the darkness on the shields (minetways).
The tacho looks at the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (minuteway), but there comes once from behind a U-boat and leads an uncompromissed to break.
In our editing, we will still fight about whether it was a Blackout of the game maker or whether the authors believed that we were so bloody.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual total impression is correctly responsible in most cases and here and even there.
More harder is that at some stressing moments, the frequency of the image is slower, and this is very dramatic.
However, this is particularly regarding accidents with greater number of shareholders, where a continuous FPS does not use anything.
The sound playing is all right, and the sound track is funny.
In trying to speak as wide as possible as the scale of young publics as well, a soundtrack ala "from all things" - but who buys such a game already because of music?
The total impression of Need for Speed: The? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game wasn't affected by the totally unnecessary errors, we would have been able to claim with the brustton of conviction that The is the best part of NFS in the last years.
But that's how the game acts incomplete.
A class of pleasure for you, but you should be prepared to prepare one of these errors with the power of the aircraft boxes in the eyes.

EU-Botschafterin Vicenová:
The Czechs have the call of negativists and euro skeptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the individual institutions feelable from the lot."
I wouldn't have expected that such a harder war would be burned."
"It will take five, six years until the wagons are stuck and all have been used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador in the Union, started very closely to the jurist faculty.
As she seriously takes the "intelligent and openly over Europe" motion, she has already shown in the first part of her debate, where it has been able to describe the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a transparent and comprehensive way that they might have been able to devote such a number of lectors of the legal faculty of the Carls University.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new constant president of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"The beginning was critical that he was too unexpected - a serious officer who had not been aware of such a role, but I have to say that it has hurt all the spirit as well he has accepted the thing.
"He is a man who will finish to listen twenty-seven Member States patiently to communicate with them and has clear ideas of how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for External Affairs and Security Policy explained it as an answer to the question: Who is this?
Nobody wants to prohibit our oil-made Quarge
Mrs Vicenová also agreed on the agenda, according to which the European Union lived, to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago, she was successful.
The Czechs would have developed the financial crisis and the gaps and also attended the east partnership meeting.
The case of the Government during the presidency was a great negative thing that had greatly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has now all hands to be filled.
With the words of the lawyer, it was not only in the president but also in the next crisis that has not yet been overcome, very hectic.
And there is still a need to be approved by the EU's seven-year budget, which makes it much more complicated because of the current economic situation.
Whether there will be a slight and spacious budget, which economic priorities, which countries will be more and less promoted - all this is now on the agenda.
The lawyer also refers to her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Intelligently about Europe".
"If I don't like anything, then there are great shortcuts, foreign words and fachjargons that no one understands.
How do I know as a citizen whether you really are in Brussels or in the cycle of guarks and many large bananas or whether someone really wants to prohibit the Quarge?
It would also like to enjoy the EU's ground to get more cheques in institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU's partnership, the Czechs are calling for euro skeptics, which are more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
Increasingly worse the weak representation of Czech in European institutions.
There are many more guilty, including the maintenance of our candidates, their incapacity to write motivation letters and not further the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the Czech Presidency, they also highlighted the force and cooperation of the Visegrad group, which was highlighted in V4.
"Create me when a Poland or Hungary comes to me and a Slovak is close to me, then the French states: "Hey, what are you standing there the heads together - is this your V4 again?" and thus makes a pretty sad mine.
According to Mrs Vicenové, the EU expects in the future, in particular, hard rules for the budget policy of the Member States.
As much more real than a "federing" she looks at the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the countries of the Eurozone and the countries without the Eurozone.
"We have the Schengen space and we already have the institution of a strengthened cooperation."
"The first time it was said that only the countries who want it and those who do not want it should be quietly disappointed."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which finally run out to a strong "Europe of various speeds", expects Mrs Vicenová.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, according to all the subjects with impact on the EU by all Member States and not only by the Eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
The IBM Innovator arrives in the second century of his existence
If you want to look for a word that the IBM's characteristics are most accurately characterized, this would certainly be the word "L'equity".
For the large public, IBM is the synonym for technology revolution, it is known as modern companies, although since its creation has been destroyed a century.
The basis for this long age has already placed her first head - the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
If he had deceived the Slogan, a number of worldwide problems were easily solved if people were ready to think about a little.
His Slogan "Pense!" was so marked that the life of the future gigant should be played (and at the same time the title of the enterprise journal that has been published in 1935 in the IBM).
This was also the foundation of the primarily prepared enterprise culture of Watsen.
"For us from IBM this long-term thinking means a continual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was therefore also a whole century because it remained faithful to his princes and did not fear to change everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society during our first century.
We hope that we will create more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company from Jubilea.
Transparent system
Watson has already been conducted in the 30 years of social care of his employees - in similar way as the undertaking Baťa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had a vacation paid as one of the first employees, an insurance by the undertaking plus elegant uniforms as work clothing and a recompense system for the best newer and salaries.
Similarly, the long-term IBM relations with their customers are also excluded.
The company was from the beginning genial in the talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide raised any discrimination - and could therefore choose it.
In accordance with this anti-discrimination strategy, it is also the current plan that Palmisan is changed by a woman at the top of IBM next year - by Virginia Rometty.
It is already 30 years at the IBM until it took the position of the rubber's, marketing's and marketing heading.
IBM makes such online burning storms in recent years, from which many future and innovative growth.
No wonders - ideas are enough, there are almost half million people in the company.
An institution with a call
Your unfair position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this inside and outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution than a simple technology undertaking," said the Professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not technology undertakings, but a company that helps business problems with technology," George Colony from Consulting Company Forrester Research added.
As the company itself points out, it is a subdivision to be only present on the market or to form it directly by this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logos because of "Big Blue" is called to one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most multilateral technology undertakings - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product width - from servers to nano.
From all the technology enterprises IBM, most patents and five of its employees have been exposed to the nobel price.
Its best findings include bank cars, credit cards, financial weapons, strike code or the diskette.
With approximately 220 billion Börsen value (marketing capitalization) IBM was the second largest technology undertakings (such as Apple) this year, which was the first time since 1996, Microsoft.
The angle forward
Not all products and innovatives faced the fun of customers today - unfortunately, for example, the trial with their own operating system OS/2, the Online Serge Prodigy or also the IBM PC jr computer.
"Business based on the current movement, so don't be emotional to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building his base walls on various platforms - and if they do not work, to leave them again.
In contrast to Microsoft opposer, which is in principle with Windows' operating system and falls.
Successful technologies
IBM's winning shares in the largest range of services, software and hardware shares in each five.
In 1990, hardware was more than fifty percent of the highest.
Since 2000, IBM has exposed little profitable assets in the value of 15 billion, but at the same time it has invested 58 billion in the purchase of future technologies.
In these investments, the IBM continues after 2008 when the modern financial crisis was the first time as a storm over the world.
Moreover, IBM remained faithful to his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment volume in the middle of the large world economy crisis.
It seems that the company IBM is not too harmless to overcome today's crisis.
The value of the IBM actions has increased by 120 Pro since 2008 and the rainwinning wines of the company w© constantly.
The company log of IBM is: everything can be changed - only the values are not.
In addition, this flexible gigant can also be expected to meet the next crisis.
IBM History: From the caesneider to the worldwide flights
The company founded in New York a hundred years ago, IBM (International Business Machines) had first a very complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took her first in 1924 - originally, it was a label name for a download in Canada and South America.
The basic stone to the later company of IBM placed the fusion of four companies, whose history was returned to the 80s of the 19th century.
They possessed technology, such as the famous stack card hours for the registration of the start and end of work.
To the architects of this new company, Charles Ranlett Flint, who also had the president in the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who set up the chief of the competition form of Thomas J. Watson to help him in the management of the company.
The Leader then even set the founders of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas to this day the unseenable culture and the property of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as already delivered by the name, began with the manufacture and destruction of all possible machines for the trade - from worst- and cup-snippets, until casses.
In the first four years in which Watson was leading the company, he doubled their ranges to nine million and the company expanded after and after all continents.
Watson was so improper for the company that he was sitting in the Chef for 40 years, just then he was solved by a son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its guidance, IBM began to work in the development of artificial intellectuality and developed the first programmers.
In the 60s, the technicians and computers of the NASA's flights helped to lead to all - to the Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 the famous human flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same architecture - the IBM System/360.
A classic PC that sets the computer standard at that time came on the market in 1981, named IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM expressed its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, she purchased the advisory part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and entered completely into the business with consultation services and services with higher value.
The concept of the "Smarter Planet" is the cost that IBM has been paid in the last three years.
It enhances the intention of use technologies in not even planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in the areas of the city and of the city management.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong story in Czechland.
In 1932, IBM has established a reduction in the Czechoslovakia at that time as the first country in Central and East Europe.
Today, IBM ČR was a strategic outsourcing center in Brunei.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and there is also a top research team of the world, which is involved in the technology of the voice recognition.
Darina Richtářova over their unfaithful gates:
Iveta - this ass you can keep, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtář (53) says - now it's Schluss!
After her wedding Joseph Richtář (53) from Iveta Bartošová's master (45) to her lovers, Darina remained the hope that Joseph would wait out of rosarote dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the next life it has set clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but not more than my partner," said Richtářová.
When Darina Richtářová of the singer I. Bartošova had offered a refuge in her own house, she wouldn't even have fallen in the dream as it comes out with her husband.
When Iveta went on her forces after 30 days and returned to Ricanny, Joseph went with him immediately.
Yes, he's even public that he loves them.
With the time Darina resigned, yes, it seemed even like she wanted to reconcile her unbelieving husband again - but now she finally gave him the walking pass.
Richitar doesn't matter with who his wife sleeps
If the ruler Iveta Bartošova should leave in the future, then he will certainly receive non-open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not throw him out."
"Now, not as a dear, devastated old axe, but as a man to whom I still have a certain commitment," Mrs Richtářová denied, but she also said that she had already been emotionally disappointed by him and was alone on mutual responsibilities.
The condition that Darina has cut him the back door, Joseph is worthless to this time.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company continues, I care about the repairs, the garden, the foundation, I make the purchases."
"My Darina, I'm talking very normal, only we don't share the bed," J. Richter (the sheet) black said.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to prevent her.
"We don't sleep each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I am sure that this is my fault, I have forgiven me in Iveta, and therefore I'm taking any responsibility.
The worst women injuries: What about you?
If you invite men to call some typical female unclean ones, they shoot out of the army some unexpectedly.
Love Women, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines in which we let a few unsitted revue again, which allow men to put the blood in the axes?
Incoming search
Do they want their gate to be incompatible?
Do you have to buy at least one hair every week?
Would you like to purchase and can it be a little more in action?
Then it's really a weakness in your case.
Some women are at least conscious of this and try to keep their purchases in the middle of control.
But the hand on the heart, which woman already does it seem to bumble on the search for a good-seat dress only by a clothes and not at the same time to try all (in all possible color combines) in the cabine?
Even if the purchase for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hage.
Well, think of how often they said to her husband, you'd better stay out of here...
Permanent Insatisfaction
"I'm not too thick?"
"I have to take at least five kilos -- I'm going to start to joke or make gymnastic?"
"Did I like you at all?"
Is that something happening to them?
Yeah?
Then you also belong to women who are regularly occupied of what they look like.
This does not mean that you should leave, but many men react allergicly, if their wife is always worried about her appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed - with the increased frequency of the complaints, women are always more reliable.
Order and cleanness at first
It's a fight against the winds.
Put windows, smoke flights and dust, swimming the wanne - and this at least twice in the week.
Do you shimp with her partner because he goes again with a swimming shoes on the clean flights, do you shake the children because the just swimming washing is already crazy again and because the glass of the room's crash has already been printing fingerprints, where, though, the polying makes so much effort?
If you suffer under this kind of "deviance", you should know that you cannot overcome anything and that the order and cleanness of family life are not at first.
Finally, this unusual purity fifth can harm mutual relations and, especially, the rest of the family.
Labels
"Smooth tournoses come into the wheel. "
"Do you really want to draw the old socks tomorrow again?"
"You don't just go on the foot."
If your partner is so exposed to a tirad, you can't wonder that it brings him to the palm.
Of course, it's not bad, but they just want that's all his order.
If the men knew that, the women might not have had to meat so much.
Classic and Tratch
Some women like clothing and stealing, there are swimming back, or even disturbing, or avoiding covenants.
Women are now focused on relations, so they like to go through the subjects such as -- who, who, who, who, who, how and why.
Well, every woman of us has a little wretchless and tratch on the camp.
The hand of the heart - that's probably the own of all women.
However, this is not to be changed with the most gross calibers, which are nothing and no one, who are probably disturbing everyone in their environment and which are particularly a significant feature for women collectives.
Jagr and Voraček help Philadelia with their assistants to win
The Eishockey storm Jaromir Yagr had a large share in the moon game of the NHL with two assistants on 5:3 sequence of Philadel Papa on the iron in Carolina and thus is the most productive of the Czech player in the NHL.
The user of the overview of the ninety-year-old Eishockey star was in both cases Giroux, who was invited to add an additional assistance and to the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also had Yagr's player Jakub Preáček.
Jagr claimed after the game journalists, he had Giroux a great night prophesied.
"Soon before the game, I tell him he's got a hattrick today."
I felt that in some way."
"He and again takes such a feeling," Jagr explained, after his action Giroux already reached a gate at the first shooting of the Flyers.
A little later, the second match also had "a Czech track".
Preavček fighted behind the gate of Hurricanes the Puck and presented it between the circles the maximum Talboth.
A second before the first third's depth, the home player Patrick Dwyer reached a short-hander, but the second third was the flyer again.
Specific Giroux.
In collaboration with Jagr, he reached his meetings, then Wayne Simmond's shooting to the fourth gate.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player of the Liga, but certainly he belongs to the best three," Jagr valued his center.
"I wouldn't have done it in my life to play with such a eishockey player as with him."
"I'm greatly glad."
"I'm cutting my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL my companions put their game on me and now the shoe turns around," shocked Jagr.
Carolina made a game for the drama - by the meetings of Tuoma Ruutua and once again, Duyer, who had been executed from a punishing shot, came to a gate.
But Matt Read prevented any other complication in which he was in overall two against one.
"Everyway, pronger acted still in our area."
"It's noticed the puck, I took up and (Read) moved to remote pieces."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad that it was cracked," he described the last match of the party from his view.
By this victory, Philadelia was set to the top of the conference.
The Czech divergence player of Montreal Jaroslav Spaček hurt in the game against Buffalo and split in the second third part because of a damage on the top body.
The Candians, besides the Beck, also learned their leader's injury in Penalty shots 2:3.
One of the penalties could not change Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points pained the tragedy of the homemanagement of the highly conditioned illness outcome in the defensive - the game they played only with five players.
"It's bad."
"The meeting we played only with one experienced player at the end, which was young players."
"But there's nothing to do, so we have to finish," Jacques Martin said.
"When we changed an attack on the other, we had nothing to cope with."
"We had to make the game easier and have to get the puck out of our third."
There were reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the players.
The Czech Portuguese Ondréj Pavellec removed thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed to the 5:2-sea on Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five downloads, five different parts had.
Development of travel prices since 1989
By 1989 there were only five allowed State travel offices: Chedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel offices solemnly sold travels to the socialist east block countries, in the west only elections.
And thus the Czech tourists travel to the East Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sotschi on the Half Crim on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary at the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was to Jugoslavia, then Jugoslavia took a good course, and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia were strongly restricted.
A large paradox of those socialist times was that even citizens of the East Block (also the Czechoslovak) were allowed to travel free in the socialist countries.
For example, if a CSSR citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual journeys were not possible.
When the travel offices also offered travels in the west, they had to buy large snows or even sleep in the beds before the travel office, or at least "good knowns" in the travel office.
Even so, the thing wasn't going for a long time.
The sog. Devisen admission - the condition for a trip to the West - was only granted "politically reliable" people - those who were not able to travel.
The Czechoslovakian Value was, in fact, not a free exchangeable wage, so without devise admission, it would have been impossible to produce the necessary funds (western west wheel) for a trip to the west.
Thus, most of the Czechs delivered their vacation in the inland, not wonderful that the Czechs bought a number of weekend houses and dads - a habit that endures until today.
The same revolution in 1989 followed a road revolution of the Czech.
Since 1989, a vacation in the DDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs passed 4.5 million of their foreign celebrations in countries of the world.
A great paradox that is not aware of today is the fact that it was not possible to travel in the most holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of the 1990s of the past century, the devise obligation was revoked in the neighbors of Western countries, which made a huge village of short visits, especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslowaks could simply not get enough time from their trips to the West, everyone wanted to be there at least a few days.
So the Czech holidays slept at traveling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who had already had had the money for a stay in the hotel or a pension.
A typical characteristic in foreign travels of Czech was at that time a full-packed coffee room with conserves, beer and duration.
Another important milenstein was the introduction of the free exchangeable Czech Krone - after year, our tourists could finally buy the west wall.
Our lives level and the average levels also increased, which in 1997 was further important.
Thanks to the enhanced requests for travel, the travel offices began regularly to prepare travels through charter flights after 1997, which allowed flights to deal with quantity processes in comparison with the past.
In the end of the 90s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already a free payment traffic with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made it easier to travel.
On another interesting moment in the history of the "post-soven" travel traveling, it came to Thailand, thanks to the high request of the first direct charter flight in an exotic country.
Since all years, direct charter aircrafts with Czech passengers are flying in remote solar countries; in this year, there are twelve exotic destinations from Czech.
To the 100 Tsd. Czech travels in exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the period that knew our "postrevolutionary" development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States raised the visa obligation for the Czech tourists, which definitively involved our country among the high-developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs delivered more than the half of their vacation in the foreign country (50.3%) and first in their history, including the costs at the holiday place, for one holiday residence, they issued more than 15 Tsd CZK per head.
The main assembly will find a new president - again a patt.
For almost five months, the Czech football has no president and threatened that Ivan Hašek's follower at the top of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not even be after the extraordinary main assembly on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is not yet any agreement on which choice is to be chosen until today.
And without this, it is not possible to vote over the three potential followers.
Three interested people want to manage the Czech football - Jindrzych Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomás.
In June, Hashek returned from his function, and he invited his colleagues to find some and a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hashek, the elderly among the two band rooms that cannot be able to find a common candidate again.
This appeared rock and clear on 16 September when the new president should be chosen.
The delegates of the main assembly had come to the Popular House in Prague fourth ́ichov, since the negotiation had no result and it was not only about the choice itself.
In fact, it was not even possible to consider who is right to vote in the full collection - only the representatives of the rational representatives or also the functionaries equipped with a full power.
In this only point, at least partly agreed, which contributed to the Recommendation of the Institute for State and Rights, whose view of a full power-based representation was not worthwhile.
However, the disputes on the election regulation continue.
In addition, the Executive Committee had no more clearness in the matter at its meetings - whether or not, or not - in principle, nothing else is on the agenda.
Even when the opinions about election changed several times, the neural point remained the same.
The question is: how to avoid a patt situation in the third century?
"The dispute point concerns the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statute or whether to find a whole other model," Dušan Svoboda, one of the three representatives of the FACHR, representing the Profi Football Management.
According to a measurement model, the candidate, which receives the largest pro-human support in the room for which he candidates.
Mars are ready to enter into the compromise that the candidate will gain the number of votes from two rooms.
The Czech page is again on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-third majority in this prolonged vote calculation.
"Then the two frontiers have no meaning anymore, this mode would ask the entire double room concept," Svoboda understands the convictions of the sea side, which best thought not to avoid the election rule, but to choose a valid status.
It is a surprise that Tomás also agrees, even if it is appealing that the rational choice order of all candidates is the most likely to meet Pelta.
"My desire is to be chosen mostly after the status."
"In order to not exhibit our replacements, as in the last main assembly," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who was first candidate and was decreased in his opinions, especially in Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
See View will be the new president in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate in the future.
"The potential qualification of the national community for the football EM of today would be safe to require the hosts."
"When the football is on the euphorian wall, then the willingness to cooperate is greater," says Jablonec's officer, who brings the most experiences from all three adepts and this at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl's back there.
"I hope for an agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is due."
"It isn't a matter between the people of bohemen and season, but there are certain efforts to "real" the rules for their own purposes."
"This is why a new blocking is not excluded in the main assembly."
"I hope, however, that the healthy human understanding finally wins," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides.
Some negotiations should be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be complete until the qualification game.
The charter flight, including Dalibor Kuchera and Rajchl, could not start to Podgorice in Prague on the morning because of a technical sight, so you were looking forwardly for a replacement, as to bring a part of the Executive Committee to the location of the bargage game.
In recent cases, the meeting at a ministrial level will be decided to come to the middle-year.
Joseph Dobeš, Minister for School, Youth and Body Education, would like to move the divided parties within the largest sports association of the country to a agreement.
It is a lot on the game: State applications, the trustworthiness of the Czech football and also the next main assembly of the CSTV, which will show the new direction to the Czech sports in accordance with Sazka's financial problems.
Likewise, the Chairman's position is in the fight because he does not see the appropriate candidate.
If Tomás ́like, the head of the Pilsner Footballer before the extraordinary major assembly, could have made a strong candidate that would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Football Federation of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have been in the fight for this point.
"If there's a good warner, I'd fight for him and deceive the choice."
"But in the present situation, it was not possible to find such a adepte," said THTK.
The main reason for walking in Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl is, therefore, to prevent the famous favorites of the election, Pelta, to the top of the FACHR.
It also emphasizes that in the case of his victory he thinks of the president's function only for a year, so until 2013, until the date of the ordinary main assembly.
In the position of the President, he would like to have seen a top manager who is not too closed into the football event.
"I have spoken personally with some people in question."
"Why do you believe that some said to me that they were not going to identify themselves with the Czech football.
"So many views would like to have changed," he said.
In most of all, the connection of Pelta's with the President of the Pilsner, Roman Berbr, a man with controversy calls, which is applied behind the cowls as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegated votes on main assemblies.
For example, it is not acceptable that Pelta had the position of the president.
"By wining the present state would be conserved and in the Czech football it didn't go forward."
"The support by Berbr, a smart businessman, becoming doublely bad to the football," stressed.
It also emphasizes that Pelta's name was fallen ago in connection with telephone hearings to investigate in a corruption case, but the Pelta was punished.
"I don't know what a prestigious victory of Pelta should bring the football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the EUFA and the FIFA," said the likelihood, who said his previous statement, "he will revoke the Pilsner Football Club when Pelta becomes a president," but he sees something more allowed.
If you win a comparison in the Thursday election, however, it can be presented to a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported the illustration before the main assembly in October, which ended with a Fiasko.
"He (Pelta) was the first I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could, for example, imagine him as a leader of the national community."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the band as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters I don't understand," said a person who gave attention in September to him that he was at the top of the replacement of Dagmar Damkowa behind the cancellation of the Court of Justice Commission with Luďek Macela.
It himself claims that he feels the role of the chairman of the band.
And based on his abilities in the management of forms, since last summer he is also the leader of pilses, who, with his support, celebrated the first triumph in the Liga in May.
"I have the power to change something in football environment and to contribute to a certain culture of this."
"To restrict the influence of certain interest groups who are tending to influence disciplinary and professional committees, which are in the present situations," a comparison that does not make any healing from its antipathie, for example, against the Sparta-Chefe Daniel Kretinský.
As one of its priorities, he considers the establishment of the relations between the FACHR and the Czech Olympia Committee, which will help him to praise the political policies to make more money flee from the lottery tax in sport.
"This is one of the decisions that the new president should take place."
"If it comes to taxation of lucky games, how the political parties make it, then I understand their arguments, but they also have to say rock and clearly where the money goes," he said.
His connection to Pilsner Club also does not look as a handicap, although he himself emphasises that the president of the FACHR must be "overpartal".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prager Dukla.
"It's not just ideal."
"It also makes my opinion not much sense to overflow my actions in the Pilsner Club seem to a third person to return after a half years," it explained.
Pelta promises new provisions of the FACHR, which will eventually exclude a patt situation.
Two days before the main assembly of the Football Conference, one of the candidates for the chairman, namely Miroslav Pelta, will strengthen himself in the case of his choice that the FACHR will receive a new statute, which will exclude conflicts on the election order in the future.
The Jablonec functioner is confidential before Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes that the election fight will be safe in the event of a success of the Czech election.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealistic election in September, he wanted to be able to be able in his election to the national population and to gain financial resources.
He decided only to share himself in the election before the last main assembly and thus helped the two-month pause to defend his ideas about the leading of the football and to present in a widespread context.
"But at all levels, they are insatisfactory and therefore expect the president to be on Thursday."
"He feels that it's the best time that the association is guided by someone, the man who is primarily connected with the Jablonecer Club, but who also acted in Sparta and in the Executive Committee for many years.
He also thinks that he has enough experiences to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that for today's problems the election of Euforia is responsible for the choice of Ivan Hashek.
"It was unfortunately accepted in the main assembly in June, which were not as perfect as all had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had had a president since September," Pelta said.
The revising of the main document of the Civil Association used as a lock for the delegates.
"If I should be president, then I'll assume it personally and I'm ready to take personal responsibility if it doesn't fail."
"This is a principle thing without which he can't be," Pelta claims.
Moreover, he does not try to limit himself to his opposers.
He had already announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized for his legal education and knows well that his opposite was his first representative.
Moreover, Tomás had no longer been attacked, who had not left any dry fade to Pelta again.
In the football he moves over a year and can already refer to a certain success."
"But his attacks were decreasing and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"Therefore, many are now doubting about real characters," addressed Pelta's contrastants, which, of course, remains faithful to his advertising, which he has already expressed in September.
See opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of the football from the bottom of the game class to the national population.
And this should be the Czech football screen.
"I would also strive to end all matters - from the case Bohemians, to the neighbors of the Corruption Chandal from the past year."
"I'd likely strike on negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient financial funds for the whole football," said the six-seven-year candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football would not mean personal cleaning.
"I had to put my confidence once with the content of work of all employees," he said in direction of Strahov, where the long anarchie often dominates nervousness.
Despite the current disastrous scenarios, which are accompanied by the next main assembly, he believes that the delegates are not going to Nymburk on Thursday.
"If it really should be the only controversial point, as you choose in the dead, then we'll get out of it."
"The football needs faith and wins it only when he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possible decision-day of his functionary currency.
Rajchl promises the FACHR starts working hard under him
If the President-in-Office Jindrich Rajchl should be chosen at the Main assembly on Thursday to the new president of the Football Federation of the Czech Republic, this would probably avoid a lot of people in the band.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He promised to solve the case of Bohemian to improve the relationship with EUFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the football and, otherwise, to continue the work started by the previous president Ivan Hashek.
"As the President, I would like to dedicate myself to the football as a whole."
Take from international contacts with EUFA and FIFA, on the national election, on the professional football, up to the service football for the youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the speech for TCK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the powers of the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football comes in each segment with miles steps."
Instead of criticising the work of others, many would not just be disappointed, because they had to begin to work hard now," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, there has been no longer to candidate.
"From me, I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me, who don't throw me a knife between my legs and ask me every step I'm doing," he said as a reveal why he was deceived.
"But many people told me that I shouldn't leave because other people would do it."
"This is confidence that you can't play," he said.
It also motivates him to continue the work he has started under Hashek.
"In two years, we have made a lot of work, and now I don't want to just remove it."
"The processes have been started, which would only come in a few years, and I would only see that they stop someone," he said and thus brings his thoughts to express that for the case that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would have chosen, could restore the situation in times before Hashek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"There are people who would do the football so that he would be there for the chosen."
I think you can forget something, but not that I'm partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then it's all right and not only the chosen," said Rajchl.
He also resists the claim that he is only a president of the Czech.
"Although some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for young men."
"For example, it's time to consider whether the liga should not be divided into a Czech and sea part whose winners then ascend into the first ligue."
"Then it couldn't be that today only three marine clubs play in the Liga, which is especially a problem for young players in the sea," says Rajchl.
Now also because the leader of the Pilsner Club of Tomás has joined the fight for the function of the president, Rajchl does not try to appreciate his chances that he is chosen.
"I appreciate a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me to his representative and now recognises that clear success is behind me," Rajchl, who also considers the saving of thirty million crowns for unprofit contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, he is guilty of the fault that the band does not go on a single street.
As he says of Pelta, "He is from the preceding discqualities to help the Czech football to put a new trust," he believes the second rival - like a strong candidate who really has offered something to the football.
"No one can question that he has done work in pilses in only one year."
"If he should be chosen, then he would promptly continue the things Ivan Hashek has started and also the personal occupation in the Commission would obviously not change fundamentally."
He would certainly not want to escape things to his favors," Rajchl judges his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Skip to Blue
By Julia Stanik
Plans in Ufo-optic, Prunkpools in Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can experience his blue wonders - and after a city tour or a wall, heavy legs in Sprudelbatters.
A book shows where Wellness is in the best water.
When Iris Meder went on research travel in the past half years, one could not fail in his package: her bathroom.
Returns on the water, she looked highly in artificially designed bottles, encountered weak marmor poets waiting for them at the beach border, and wondered over akribically restored youth-style halls.
If she liked a bathroom, she flew it in her notebook - as well as valuable details about the building and history of the building.
More than 200 shimbeds, architectural historian Meder announced in this way - and now presents it in its famous book "Badefreuden": Population Halls in München, historical bathroom palaces in Black Wald, "Hardcore-Beton Building" in Taunus.
By 13 countries, she brought her "reise to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe": Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czechland, Slovenia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real bathroom enthusiast.
With sport, she doesn't have much at the hut, says Meder - just in the water it's different.
It is only difficult that swimfans with blue bottles and chloride stone must be found while joggers can breathe the powder of fifty forests or rejoiced birds in the park.
"I asked myself on one day why the wheels must always be so furious," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I began to gather beautiful babies."
Duplicate architecture of water surface
It is therefore so big because all the senses are used, as meder.
And when the building efforts have been made, the swimming halls may be a real mouse: "A town of a footland you have a surface of water in boats."
"He's on the one hand transparent, but reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high popularity, bunch of shoes, spring bretter.
The small-format image band "Badefreuden" provides 190 pages of value over the history of the architecture and cultural oases of the wellness - but especially enjoys a spring in blue.
Remarkable copies discovered the Pool Collector Meder in their research in Hungary.
Besides beautiful health baths such as the 100-year-old Shechenyi-Bad in Budapest, they found a nitrat-containing army in a urinary carsthole (Höllenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bad, whose beaches are with alkalitic water, and are in a flash-formed building (Városi Termalkundö in Jašberény).
Speecular views, however, offer a lot of poor free ships in Switzerland and Austria: Currently you have the whole city in the eye of the surrounding Dachbad, you can look at the snow covered Arlberg in the outside pool of a bathroom in St. Anton - and: In the Dampfbad there is a window from which you can see the treating on the ski track.
Maybe the most extraordinary pool design expects bathroom guests in the long field: The aquadome otztal looks like a Ufo just in the alpes.
From three to top open scales it pumps in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the oxtal rain into heaven.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in each swimbad, the pool collector Meder of Chlore's church increased into the nose.
Thermal baths ride in the Arr-d-Bad in the Hungarian Bekescsaba so strongly strike up to oil that you can never believe to be landed in a health bathroom.
The church comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate healing water, which is almost black and its skin clothes one on the skin, as soon as you can go into the beach - a wellness experience of the special kind.
At one place Iris Meder was also disappointed at her search for beautiful bathrooms: When she wanted to visit the free and sunbad in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bathroom made by Architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was inter alia closed.
When Meder threw a cut through the brown windows of the red-white-rule youth-style buildings, she saw how unchrist grows between the flights.
In contrast, in a magnifying swimbad in the Black Wald: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three buildings have this bathroom already behind it; not only Neoroman elements from his creation in 1844, but also a Maurice Hall in Alhambra style, which was added about 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favorite bath of the Pool-Kenerin Iris Meder - not only because it originally comes from the Black Wald.
"It's already a service to mix such a variety of buildings to a so great unit," Meder says.
In such a palace, the touching in the thermal pool is evidently only a neighborhood.
Agrar Speculation
Deutsche Bank allows the raising of materials to light
By Christian Teevs
Does the German Bank open their business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Joseph Ackermann ordered a working group to examine the consequences of the speculation for the poor of the world.
In January the Concerning Boss will then take consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Citizens, it is clear that 84% of the Germans is not acceptable to speculate banks with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or meat.
Two thirds of the questionnaires require the German Bank and other credit institutions to get out of this business because it strengthens the problems of the poorests in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa investigation in the task of the Foodwatch Consumer Organization.
This is based on a report that presented the Foodwatch in the midst of October.
In this, the author Harald Schumann shows that the laws at the global baskets are the prices - and that the banks therefore contribute to the world's hunger problem.
The consumers' campaign is specifically addressed against the German Bank Chief Joseph Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, raw material laws were intended to secure the marketers against price distortions.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that the sockers have disconnected from boat and request - and make the costs of the poorest benefits.
Instead of the US competitors, Ackerman responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the projects and said that no business is "valuable to put the good call of the German Bank on the game".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, a international working group currently examines the proposals from the Foodwatch report.
To the end of the year, the investigation will be completed, then the results will be presented to the German Bank's representation - and the recommendation to do so.
On the end of January, the bank's top wants to inform the consequences of it.
Finally, there could be a reduction of the raw material, or even the complete decline.
Ackermann bastels and Images
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time confirmed his criticism in the financial industry: "The law on increased prices of food shows particularly drastic how banks, unrespected today, damage the general welfare."
Ackermann is now the top bank lobbyist, especially in the obligation.
"The German Bank must remove all the installations from its portfolio, where money for laws is set to the price of foods," said Bode.
"If Mr Ackermann suffers from hunger or the call of the German Bank."
The Ackermann's insight is surprising on the first corner, but it is clear that the director wants to give a perfect picture a few months before the office.
On Monday, the German Bank said that the Chairman would not change to the Supervisory Board other than planned.
With a discharge from the obscured agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And to make possible invoices, he needed to be a little sharp - so he would have done his followers.
Each second would cancel raw material plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
To this end, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
The Board published on Monday the investigation for which the Institute Forsa asked on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
It is therefore legal that the German Bank offers facilities for prices for food.
The banknotes would also take personal consequences if they learned that their bank shares in such businesses: each second would, according to the investigation, announce all facilities where money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 Pro€ would take known persons from such a bank, order 49% to think about the cancellation of their account and change to another institution.
21th house in Vienna
The Environmental Pavillon
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with heights, depths and Happy End: the Austrian world exhibition pavilion of Brussel 1958, was made to the Museum in Vienna, standing empty and accommodated.
He's now being opened as an exhibition house.
If modern warfare architecture is warmed, by clear forms, glazing halls, courageous sugars and new buildings typically for the faith in the technical progress, then the Austrian pavillon of Architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussler World Exposition of 1958 is a famous and famous example.
Swanzer's Pavillon then received the Grand Prix d'architecture for his easily and swimming steel glass construction.
The building is used as a milenstein of modern architecture until today.
He made the architects so that he also built in the next world exhibition of Austria's Pavillon.
With legendary BMW-veirilinder houses plus a swimming neb building in München, he was celebrated internationally in 1973.
He was planned as a temporary exhibition building, Pavillon was set up in the Swiss garden in the South Wales, rebuild and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20th House" was called it.
But the building was not space and technically as Museum - no walls for the capture of art, no climate.
Nevertheless, it was enjoyed so long until the modern art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Crischanitz has converted the Pavillon, he now calls "21th house" and will be enjoyed as a Museum for modern art.
On the service day, the Belveder Museum, to whom the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a happiness case in any way.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belveder 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted Kun-toric with careful kare, etc. in the youth as an earnest supplier, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as a foundation director of the Museum of the Moderne Salzburg, put the rebuilding closely to the construction and thought-times, entrusted public funds and private sponsors and set the use.
Besides the present art, the works of the imagehouer Fritz Wotruba should be issued from the same named foundation, a coffee and a bookload should be provided, and a office house was to be built.
Strength view, small food
Crischanitz was then the ideal repository for the implementation.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's session in Vienna was sensitively rebuild and gained competition, but because he studied in Swanzer at the Technical University of Vienna, and the Pavillon was a "thousand important place" for him, where he had "only every week" viewed the exhibitions.
He knew the Ur-project, and he knew the problems of the building that already lost in his translation to Vienna and his reuse of greatness and easily.
There were many bigger problems in the current rebuilding: the building was "a energy stream", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fassade have been changed, isolated glass isolated glass has been used and the glass is replaced by special safety glass.
Calcium-brown stalks have been strengthened or replaced, and asbest-date covering has been sanished.
Two subcutaneous spaces for the new use, a shield light grave between house and street provides for the explanation, a bridge leads to input - almost a new building, but still the light Swanser pavillon.
The original outsides have remained, the house is stuck in the old road-brown roast protection color.
And the kinosal is even exactly as he was earlier.
And this is all under the strict view of the minds and with a small food.
"Oft had to be found a material that is good and fair and also to the mental protection office," says Crischanitz and points to a rubbish ground in the underground.
Despite all forces, problems and rebuilding, the building is flexible and easily remaining.
It was difficult to have been with the Pavillon, "the one coming from Brussel," Crischanitz said recently a typical "Drop-in-the-City history".
Such a architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and wants to "reveal a proper conscience."
In this case, the 21th house is not in the wrong place, because there has been a city-building lucky case: around the Swiss garden, it is just the new planned "Haupt-house quarter" with offices and residents.
And another happiness may still occur: The 21th house could be strengthened by another Crischanizz-build, because the Collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Kunstplate, and as you hear, it has already negotiated with the city for a neighborhood place in the Swiss garden.
Bathroom plant winter crises package in millions of highs
The train has made a crisis plan to prevent the outcome in the winter.
The number of employees should be duplicated.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related gains and delays, the German bathroom reports more than 70 million euros in this year.
The "image" quotation reported in advance by vocation to a single internal crisis plan until 2015, investments of approximately 300 million euros were provided.
In this way, better availability of vehicles and skinnets should also be achieved in extreme widespreads.
It is planned, inter alia, to double the internal and external workers for the elimination of snow on trains and trains at 16.000 persons.
The objective is to free train growth until the start of the operation and 90% of the useful weights within four to five hours from snow and ice.
Two months ago, the boss Roudiger Grube had warned after a meeting with the government and the industry before access and delays in this winter.
In the past winter, traveling in personal transport had significant problems, as it lacked, inter alia, in difficult weather conditions, of reservations.
Thus, many new regional movements have been waiting for an authorisation from the railway board for years.
Moreover, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE movements.
The train also makes it for years that it has to make an eye of ICE movements clearly more frequent in the workplace after a ICE in the Colin's main roadhouse had an axis break.
German Bank pays million penalties in the United States
After the Tumult of Chief Joseph Ackermann comes newly out of the United States: The German Bank has to take a million buckets there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for the German Bank, the Brancharian is still in its past in the United States: the Frankfurter Institute pays in a comparison of 145 million euros (106 million euros) to combat five large association banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of hypotheking papers.
The financial regulatory NCUA proposes a whole range of large banks to have delivered the association banks with false promises to purchase financial products; they would have decreased the risks.
Such papers are lost in the period of financial crisis and the banks are in depth.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the subject without the parties to the court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The Bank was not guilty of the comparison.
This also applies to the citigroup committed to payment of 20.5 million.
The NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the outcome of the two houses.
The National Credit Union Unit (CUA) is responsible for the United States Company Banks and is engaged in stakeholders to deal with customer institutions.
The NCUA is trying to replace the occurring billion difficult damage.
The currently closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also acquired other large banks and in summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The questionary hypotechnical papers are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on household credits.
When the U.S. Immobile Blue 2007 placed, this was a number of financial forms to be detained.
In September 2008, on the high point of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers killed.
Even if the events are left for a few years, the banks are currently faced with a low wind in the United States.
Investors and supervisors have encouraged numerous complaints to receive recovery or to feed deficiencies.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has issued the greatest claim.
It proposes 18 international large banks that have overcome two US Immobiliary financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at hypotechnical businesses in the volume of approximately 200 billion.
In addition, the German Bank has to make a complaint of the FHFA, here is a number of businesses in the total of 14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory staff requires the Frankfurters to stand for "substantial losses" without, however, to call a precise sum.
The German Bank rejected the requests as uncontinued and explained that it would want to refuse.
Warren buffett increases with 10 billion IBM
Financguru Buffett invests strongly in the IT firms IBM.
Since March he has produced action in the value of more than billion.
Too long, the big investor Warren Buffett has always explained not to invest in IT and computer companies because the long-term development of companies is only a bad prognozation.
However, he has read the business reports of IBM and has changed his view of investment in the industry.
He has already had to understand much earlier that IBM offers services and provides computer systems for the IT divisions of other companies.
A investment of Warren Buffett is considered as a rider in the financial world.
This is why the IBM IT-Urgestein can now be called Sir IBM.
Because Buffett enth now has been in the US business sentor CNBC that he has bought IBM actions since March in value of 10,7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus increased to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5,5 Pro.
Buffett said that IBM did not even know anything about the commitment.
He praised the management that even in the economic crisis had provided for regular profits.
"You have done a great job," Buffett said to.
The IBM has seen the lucrative IT series, such as the operation of calculations.
More than 100 years old computer pioneers also offer software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had preferred to avoid technology forms until date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, the buffett approached, such as a frequency travel, with a milk manufacturer or machine builder.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway日 nearly 80 own daughters also shares in a whole series of large concerns such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former monster back.
The 81-year-old took the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built it with smart investment to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is modesty.
That is why he is a cold figure for numerous investors worldwide.
His almost improper sense of money value has introduced him the "Orakel of Omaha".
After announcement of the buffett investment, the IBM action increased as a pro.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, is over 220 billion billion worth in the bourse and counts with Apple and Microsoft to the world's most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he didn't want to come in.
Reasonable Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is acceptable
Following the discovery of the "Twice Cell" Turkey media in the German legal state doubts.
A magazine is talking about a "blowing ideology" that is now experienced again.
The murder of eight Turkish and a Greek small enterprise in 2000 to 2006 had a right-extremistic background.
This message is reacted in Turkey and in Germany and in Germany.
For many German tours, there is a longer believed penalty: Since the brands in Mõn in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there was no comparable violence with the right-extremistic background against Turkey.
However, the fact that there is foreign enemies in Germany has never been in question.
However, the discovered right-extremistic network shows the size of which the size is not longer abstainable.
"Lege the bloody ideology again?", entitled the Internet issue of the Turkish magazine "Haberturk".
However, the magazine "Sabah" points out that one of the acters should be a V-man of the Constitutional Protection and is concerned that the German authorities could also be involved in the right radical sumpe.
The Turkish community reacted to Germany: she recalled at the end of the week with a wallet guard before the Brandenburg Port to the victims of racism violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish people in a festival of the fifty-year-year stage of the German-Turkey advertising agreement.
In joyful colors, it was inscenated together - as a story of success.
As an earlier, the reporting of some Turkish media: "The German gift to the fifty" is the heading of a article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the back foundations of the murder series.
In addition, the issue of the "Hurriyet" of Germany is not allowed to take this grateful connection.
"It begins to sting," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He emphasizes that people were killed, paying taxes and making a significant contribution to the rebuilding of Germany with their work.
In addition, in Germany, the Internet forests are critically discussed by the Police and their later experience.
Why the German authorities haven't already been more able to search for suspicious in right-extremistic circles, the authors wonder.
Some of them are at least ready to drastic means: "If there continues to be slaughtered, the migrants remain nothing but self-defence and weapons."
"It'll be the best self-guard."
"From the goodness of the revelation and the meditation of the penalty of the entire network is very strongly depending on the internal peace in Germany," says "Selen".
What it means, when the internal peace is in Germany, the attacks of Mõn and Sollingen in the nineteen years are explained.
The photo of the brandruine of Solingen is deeply enhanced in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed that there is a gross threat to the Turkish living here, and to the Germans that disloyalty and distantness can be put into right violence.
However, the attacks increased our feelings on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the last error
In the Turkish press, especially at the time, it was committed to the consequences of the German: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mõn.
After the brand attack of Solingen, he sent a telegram to the Turkish presidents, but he was represented by the Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the same time in his speech of how many taxes did the Turkish Turks.
As a result, the value of a person is calculated according to the height of its taxes.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows the deepness of the disloyalty of many Germans in the modern legal state.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive remarkable and reevaluation of the right-extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it needs open words.
The Skandal Bank of Zürisee
The avenue bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankroot in the financial crisis and then slipped from a crisis to the next.
Now let a German judge it.
That's what Axel Weber didn't think.
Following specular decline from the top of the Federal Bank, in July it was said that he would reach a nearly speculate new job in 2013: the President of the Swiss Council of the Great Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative kar's scrutiny.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, Swiss praised her beauty and the UBS of her newly obtained solidarity and made friendly comments fall on the future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the tournauround."
"I'm happy to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grubbel."
But in September, it was clear that everything would be different.
A UBS trader in London had lost all the bank's security systems and covered around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS president Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, had to go.
The President of the UBS's Administrative Board is also determined - and everyone asks, "When finally comes Axel Weber?
Weber has already been able to consult the Bank from February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Government Council will already adopt in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank informed on Saturday.
For Axel Weber it will be hard.
He is not a banker, a much more economic professor and a note bank, and he would certainly have needed a time of co-operation.
He then takes the responsibility for the bank's responsibility, which has soon demonstrated that it deserves the title "Europe's largest scandal bank".
Because the UBS is a big one side - to recently it was the greatest power manager of the world - and it has slipped for years from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, the so proud Swiss bank is going out.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent call.
The image of the swift and solid but also exhausted Swiss power manager had combined it with enormous goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in the investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007, on one hand, managed more than 1.6 billion billion eligible customers than any other world bank.
And, on the other hand, it was expected to be a investment bank in the Liga of the largest banks of the world.
That made an impression.
The unique banker and later long-year bank Professor in Zürich Hans Geiger said: "My students I have always put the UBS as a pattern of a good bank at that time."
"On today's view, you're wondering, "How could I just be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was evident that something belonged to the UBS.
In the midst of the year, the president Peter Wuffli came back as a surprise, which had become a hoc-hintellectual and even genial banker.
A few months later, they knew why he had gone.
The bank's investment party had been covered with subprime papers and had to write billions.
To educate this, UBS announced an increase in capital in the height of sage and wrote 13 billion francs.
In fact, they found investors, however, which some of them would have been thrown up to a short time before: an intransparency Asian State Fund from Singapore and a Arab State Fund that had not even learned his name.
But that was just the first shot.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The Bank had to give a new billion losses, President of the Administrative Council Marcel Ospel, 2006 and the Governing Board of Switzerland, was returned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS stood in front of its investments in the financial crisis before the breakdown and had to be saved by the State.
The National Bank purchased the UBS for thirty billion problems of value papers, which the Swiss egg scientist gave six billion francs for a force change facility for which they could become the bank's owner.
The whole Switzerland was shot - because she noticed how dramatic it was for a small country when it cooked so large banks.
The bi-sum of UBS 2007 was more than five times greater than the Switzerland economic performance (see graphic).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first catastrophe was attacked by the second.
For a few months, the UBS was in the fight against taxes with America and was ready to issue the data of customers who may have been in charge with the bank.
Moreover, she voted in a payment of 780 million -- as a refund of unfair profits from these businesses and a penalty.
In order to help the UBS more or less open to interfere with tax interruption.
At the same time, she lost something that since her capital had been in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of divergence.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It followed the meeting of the Chairman and the President of the Administrative Board.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank lost its credibility in two central business areas: in investment banking through the failure speculate and in the capacity management through the support for tax intervention.
And soon as it became more harder, just as you thought, now the UBS will get it again, these unfortunate trade stories follow: a single tradeer hides 1.7 billion euros before the Bank realizes that something is going on.
And it will be obvious: with the risk management of the investment banking, it is obvious that it is still not possible.
"In the case of Adoboli, it has to be found that risk control has too little changed," says Martin Janssen, economy and financial professor at the University of Zürich.
Furthermore, the financial proposal of a large German bank is secure: "The problem of UBS is that she does not have risk controls."
That was exactly the idea that the Swiss bankiers had reached a long time ago to become the guards of the great powers of the world: no too large risks, for security for money - could also break the world on the side of the Alpen Republic.
The Tresore of the Swiss banks became a symbol of unfairly reliableness, such as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially edle chocolate.
The UBS center in Zurich is still covered with the closure of the dead Swiss bank - it is just a little bigger.
The situation is classical.
The Bank has its main seat at the Zuric Travel Road, which leads from the main travelhouse from direct to the Zurich Sea, which is surrounded by the snow covered by the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are worthwhile, the ladenmites belong to the highest in Europe.
Juweliers like Tiffany's are found here between Swiss traditional businesses such as Sprüngli.
Since centuries, the Swiss banks have lived here: from the National Bank over the Palast of the Credit Suisse to elitary banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS receipt room is located by a severe door.
The walls are marmor dressed, so they stand dicke leaderssel, near the bank log, a large remark for "save".
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
These ideas of the Swiss Bank have both Swiss Grand Banks, UBS and Credit Switzerland, but sometimes they have disturbed or betrayed, as the leader of a small Switzerland bank.
He should not like to read his name in the magazine, and he does, like all Switzerland Bankers, business with both large banks.
The UBS has become too big, he finds - especially in the investment banking, where the Angels are also spread.
The Swiss wouldn't have anything to say there anymore.
"And if, they have been adapted to the seats of the Angelsachs."
In fact, it was the English Investment Banking that changed the UBS, which was the first high winning and then the debt: No financial institution has lost so much money as the Swiss Grand Bank in the subprime dschungel.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster became visible.
"In the middle of that mid-week, the Government coalition of the small seven million countries took the biggest salvation action in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in the book "The UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros allowed the larger bank to save the bankroot.
How could that be done?
If you speak to Swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three Great Banks joined a strong concert.
There was a bank that had already been too large in the fusion for the small Switzerland and continued to grow.
It helped the two different preliminary banks of the UBS to be added: a rich but sleeping bank with the focus of the power management point in Zurich and a poor but stronger internationalized.
Slowly, the internationalized investment banks benefited from a lot of money that would be able to turn a big road.
Two names are connected to this growth of UBS: Peter Wuffli, the UBS Concern Chief of 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the Management Board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-telecule, modesty, who understands many models and statistics, and Ospel, the boyman who has gone up from the bank teacher to the top."
But Ospel left on Wuffli for the end.
And Wuffli, at the end, had probably made a determining error: "He thought his models were the reality," said Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, overmut came before the case.
UBS employees are clearly reminded of the driving force meetings on which the Concerning Boss Wuffli continued to publish the same word: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The Bank was the most powerful investment bank of the Earth.
She introduced the "League Tables", the Rìeists who documented the success of the banks at that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go up.
Some steps have been lucky for her.
She played up in the devisen business and in the action trade.
However, business advisers who were charged highlighted a weakness: in the international interest business, in the banker "Fixed Income", there is a great distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has rubbers in ananasic hypothec products.
In order to close this lock, UBS went into an aventure that she almost costed the existence.
Hungary after growth, both the Bank and one of its founded healing funds invested in subprime installations.
She developed to a huge machine, which contained the value papers on ananasic hypotechnical credits, but also the risks.
Even if other banks are looking for the outcome.
"Too in Summer 2007, when the real estate was in flames, the UBS cooked there," says Banken Expert Geiger.
So big the Euphorie, so deep the case.
One manager had to follow the other when trying to clean it was more difficult than he thought.
Posts at the UBS have been to the sleeder seat and are watchful until today.
Who's driving the Grand Bank now has a almost impossible job.
He must find an area for a bank that has been determined by all nearby business models.
Bank Researcher Geiger already has a idea: concluded with the investment banking, convergence on the capacity management, return to the Swiss roots.
However, the bank doesn't want to go so far.
But the investment banking has to strike strongly, so much is clear now.
On Thursday, the new bank head Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to present his future.
The 51-year Italian Switzerland was only considered a transitional solution when the Bank was surprisingly separated from foreheads.
In the meantime, he has made it: he will continue to carry out the UBS business, the Zurch Bank shared on Sunday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to return to the middle of the nineteen years.
It's 3500 places.
But that's not enough.
The UBS needed a vision.
Who's she?
What does she want to do for money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber's sure is now.
In public he only says that he will find a apartment in Zurich with his wife only once.
Next year.
U.S. Burses were charged before recession in Europe
The threatening recession in Europe has made the US investors courage for the week-up.
Government changes in Athens and Rome remained without a snare.
The suspicious industrial production on the continent stressed the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in Keim.
The general facilitation of government change in Rome and Athens could not be implemented.
The euro fell against it.
The Italian and Greek glass has even covered as a half full in the last week, not as half empty - but now the problems have been forced back in front, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, the financial values were on sales.

The industry in the 17 Euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is to the end of the exhaustity.
In September, the companies produced two Pro less than in the previous month, as the Eurostat Statistical Board notified.
This was true by the US investors skepticly: "We are not an island but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to be released so quickly from a recession, and there will be further signs of weakness in the banks.
The Warren Buffett invested only in this regard: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early to invest in state liabilities or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a year old Prince over the crowds and entered the US technology industry.
His investment over more than billion in IBM  held the course of the traditional concert and allowed him to note the trend in the trading period nearly a Pro日.

Intelligent powers spread in cities
Instead, seeds are used as "problem birds": but from the cities the hot-intelligent animals are not longer exploited, claimed experts.
One of them, the others want to be quickly released: race belongs to the city image since centuries, but in many communes, inhabitants are concerned about the beast and the heat of the animals.
There is no means against the "Problem Birds" until now.
Seeds are no longer getting out of the towns, experts said at the first rock symphosis in the east Friday Empire.
Experts from the whole federal area provide for possible outputs.
You are looking for alternatives in towns
Naturely, the problems in towns also brought back to the landfly of particularly seeds: the chemical intervention in agriculture continues to destroy the traditional living areas.
The jail, continuous building and the case of typical brush trees made the birds difficult to live.
The powers are under natural protection.
Great colonies with more than 600 brutpairs are included in the West False Soest, in the northwest, including in Jever, diephol and Achim at bremen and in empty.
There, in 2005, a conflicting project for massive killing of potatoes in the landscape for negative lines.
Criticians have taken the fishing of animals in bird falls and killing with knives as particularly brutal.
"The normal distribution, the grooming, doesn't bring anything," reported the town and landscape Werner Klöver.
Nester split with water or falling trees, often had unrequired consequences, also said the environmental expert Manfred Caiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals go out, big colonies split up and divided themselves into other places."
Inflammation is only available as a exception from hospitals, older houses or schools.
"We have to live with them, we don't get them away anymore."
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities will not be solved, but the citizen Wolfgang Kellner has said to be empty.
It is thought to be a combination of animals from sensitive residence areas and lock offers to restore them to other places.
"Infotafels place Ketten speaking," however, the psychological and ethnological Uta Maria Jürgen for a completely different relationship with the animals: "A pickle in the face can be the best self-conscious one."
Jürgens in Schleswig-Holstein had joined the Ascheberger Krähen-Learnway to inform the records of the life of the hot-intelligent seeds.
The project is already adopted by tourists.
In addition to the criticism of the birds, Jürgens had a own opinion: "There is every number of communications that have many to say."
The intellectuality and intellectuality of animals are legendary: Seeds use not only help to come to a lecker bishop, but also make their tools as a helper.
Behavior scientists at the University of Cambrie have recently tested four seeds, as far as the intellectuality of birds is enough.
In a experiment, the birds learned quickly that they needed to bring a stone to the insult to reach a motten larve.
Without a lot of training, they recognized objectively what size and form they need to have a stone to make the platform collaborate.
In a second trial, the pigs had to solve a greater problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers placed a small egg with a mottenlarve.
With the snabel, the birds couldn't get their bottles.
However, the researchers had placed them draft pieces.
From this, all four animals formed a pitch, which helped them to hang the eggs on the roof.
Three of the four seeds were even on Anhieb.

The ex-Wolfsburger of the English table leader Manchester City put a headball on the subside of the latte, but the ball does not exceed the Torline (33).
Jiracek matches the Czech Republic
Then the District Director Wolfgang Stark was from Ergolding at the center point.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in Bosnish Strafroom, Stark disappeared on the switch and showed to Portuguese the yellow map (36).
On the other hand, Stark gave a conflicted trade meter after a action of Fabio Coentrao, which safely converted the Misimovic.
However, after the pause, the vice-European master made it clear in 2004 with four meetings.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended in the 81st minute.
In 1976, the European Master follows the EM fifth time.
However, the manship of Tra日 Michal Bilek with the Federal Legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) had also been lucky and had to overcome a second in the beginning phase.
Slussmann Petr Cech prevented with a reflection at the last moment a possible owner through Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had his greatest opportunities when Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.

The gate quickly before closing made it clear.
Thus Turkey lost Zagreb's football miracle.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed 0:0.
In order to ensure that Guus Hiddink has to place his place in the WM third bank of 2002, the Croatians can enjoy their fourth participation in a EM.
Before 31,000 viewers at the Maximir stadium, Turkeys had almost shown a dream start.
In the seventh minute, Selcuk Inan met with a distant shot only the poests, the Kazim Kazim rider couldn't even decrease the appraler in the gate.
After the time of the second, however, Croatia was more controlled.
Even after the pause, the Croatians didn't burn anything.
Besides Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made a place from the 62th minute for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic, the Federal Legionary Danijel Pranjic (Bayern München) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Introvision Frankfurt).
Trapattoni leads to EM

Constantin Vassiljev (57.) is excluded for the guests.
Ireland had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had the first chance.
First at the last moment, the Estonia's backmanship prevented the possible leadership.
But in the 32th minute it was far.

Mass killing at a personal level
Peter Englund's senseful and greatly starts the new book "Sovereignty and fear. A story of the First World War, spoken in nine shocks" with a long list of major persons that go to heart.
Here is a tip of how to follow: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
They will know these people in English's romantic story, and these main people will work as your GPS, as a lighttorm at these few moments when you, like English's men and women in the nebel of the war, have lost your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Price for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he did not describe as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are rare messengers, racial reporters or discussions on taktics and equipment.
It's less than a book of what's done, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It's "sensitivity, impression, experience and votes".
"Sovereignty and fear" is nearly 20 or less unexpected men and women together on both sides of the war, from schoolmates and botanics to mountain growers, doctors, hospital cars and officers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some are being captives of war, lost members, deceived or died.
Each of these lives flourish like the votic clergy in a church, some come together while destroying others.
The English book is weakened from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the demanding war at the Westfront.
"Shappy and fear" turns with experts over other war squares: the Alpen, the Balkan, the Eastfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book, a celebrated birthday among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsef is a unresolvable problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moved book.
The war survives the life of these people as a natural disaster, such as a Hurrikan Katrina, who rides to Cordit.
Imagine you're a woman who is with her children home, and hears canon fires in the remote. Do you stay or take the flight?
Who's coming at all?
Someone understands what is done or why this war is at all.
"Failing facts," says Angel, "they have been encouraged with disappointments, assumptions, hopes, enthusiasms, fixed ideas, deterioration theories, dreams, dreams, dreams and reproofs."
"Shackness and fear" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, a English hospital sister in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmatrose.
Their stories were mainly received reminders, letters and other already published materials.
Your life reports may be terrifying or incredible, but they are extremely alive in English of the assembly of small moments in detail.
Others act of lack and help.
In the history of a German scholar, he said, "Replace, replace everywhere."
"Substitute coffee, wrong aluminium, wrong radiator rubber, paper connections, wood buttons."
He told more about the replacement in Germany.
He describes "meat made of printed trips and was thrown into hammer fat (and later served with a false bone of wood), Tabak, made of drunked roots and drunk cartofels, shoes that were covered with wood."
It was, as he noted, "837 registered narrow replacements authorised in the production of wheat 511 registered coffee replacements."
Some stories are acting of honor and tactfulness.
A American recognizes his own threat to wildness and says about the war: "It feels that, despite all things, it was better for men to sit down than for men in the hall, with the night or the bestseller and a whisky in the hand, and to do so, as a fascinated civilization, and that there is no barbary behind its own strengthened and shaken heatbrush."
Environmentally, a British soldier recognizes that he dies deceivedly and no one will take a note of it or take care of it.
"If you think of the thought of offering yourself, you want to think that this happens before a public," he writes.
Instead of this, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was bound in secret."
Other observations are conducted by the ancient Europe that falls out, and about the new types of terror.
"The conflict has continued to be a economic conflict," Englund writes, "a war between the factors."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the younger century": "the word invoked and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the measurement train that kills while he sits behind a table."
Humans behave in an unforeseen way and there is also freedom of behaviour like heroism.
Anglund is responsible for the soldiers who have actively tried to steal with sexual illness in a prostitute to escape the front service.
"The great expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococky eggs because they buyed soldiers and smitted themselves on their genitals, in the hope of coming into the hospital," he wrote.
"They who were really deceived shot him into the eyes, which caused them to be blind from their life."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves, the English Poesia is avoided, however, inappropriately and is perfectly conformed to his human task.
In decades of small scenes, he begins the way the war "only determined incontrolable powers: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders lead them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were most false like Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Me ́" or Romans like Erich Maria Remarques "Nothing New in Western" than a huge story books.

After an early failure, a minutely planned override
Hundreds of police officers were shared with some of them.
It was decided for Monday night on Tuesday because at this time some people are almost in Zucotti Park.
The operation was secret and only few high-range officers were informed. All other believed first to be shared in an exercise.
President of the Police Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence stressed the fact that the operation had completed challenges.
The events of the last weeks, such as the use of Pfefferspray against Protestants, which violates the rules of the dearnate and makes the householders a huge growth of public sympathies, were no longer able to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by watching how occupations were handled in other cities.
A catastrophe exercise had found place with a cube on Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officers strengthened the Chaos School - measures to combat terrorism, which also includes the rapid presentation of a large number of police officers - to be able to go on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit found Montagnight on the East River side of Manhattan.
The order to enter the park came "in the last minute", said someone who was trusted with the orders, what for a declaration as "exercise".
"The few cops who joined myself didn't know that it was about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to stay anonymous.
"The only people who knew that it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-range officers of the restaurant."
One reason for the secretary was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, the officers wanted to leave the park, but weeks later, when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officers of various police units were shared in the operation by Tuesday, including use commands from the entire city - hundreds of mobile officers, usually used in high crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that through the day, many people go into the park, almost like Pendler, so 1 hour in the night is a good time to come in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people stay in the park," he said.
Saving cars with jupiter lamps and speakers were prepared before the pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bri.
The lamps and the previously opened messages that dressed from the voice speakers seemed to have a lot of protesters.
When the public officers entered their light blue windjacks in the park, many protesters simply rafted their things together and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 a.m. there would not be any cells attached to give the protesters time to pack their hair and good together.
Other teams of officers have been seen when they gathered themselves in the environment to join, they should need arrests in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, speaker of the police president, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claimed that they wanted to stop watching the police operations in the park, and they said the traffic of officers was very close.
Mr. Browne said that television cars in the Church Street could have made photos on the western side of the Park.
When the police moved towards the West through the large crowd of the protesters' personal matters, including coffees, artstrass and clothes with clothes, their employees followed the purification of the city, quitting what was left.
Some protesters who refused to go were dropped out, and pictures of this have occurred shortly later on the Internet.
A main kernel of protesters was in the nearby of the kitchen area of the store in the centre of the park position.
Some created barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
Circa 10 persons in the Epi’s camp were connected to their arms.
And two people were stuck on trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Officers of the Catastrophe Protection were called to cut them out.
As Mr. Kelly said, there were no arrests in the park until about 3:30.
The room was completed after the police statement after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority of the prisons came, as he said, because of "unforeseen behavior and opposition against an arrest".
The prominent officer was Joseph J. Es ́o, the head of the Department, the highest uniformized officer of the Department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the criminal officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "not the operation", as Mr Browne said.
In the case that they should access, a second group of officers waited at the lateral side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
On the Cortlandt Street, a north of the park, and on the Pine Street, a block on the south, Barrikades were created.
It could be observed how these locations from the police continued to expand the surrounding area around the Zuccotti Park.
At one place, several officers, many of them with protective sheets, were observed.
Circa 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent acts of the night found place in the south of the Park.
By 5 a.m., the Pine Street switched a protester to the cotton of a police vehicle and other demonstrants left the air from the river of a police.
In one place, the multitude threw a piece of wood.
Finally, a officer and a protester came to the hospital.
The maintenance facility will make a complaint against the city because of releases
The facility that hundreds of school managers who have lost their job last month is planning to complain the city at the middle of the week, since their unusual influence on the schools that teach poor students is not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the latest opportunity that the company, the circle Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reject releases.
Six hundred twenty-seven school assistants, maintenance coordinators and other employees who had lost their work on 7 October, and who had lost their work as a political decree in order to refuse access to a health fund that was held by the working groups on the last year.
This accusation has been rejected by the authorities.
On a hearing of the town Council, Dennis Walcott, director of schools, said that the releases were part of the budget that you had passed in June.
One member of the town Council shot back and told him that in the budget nothing specificer would be done to the workers of the school aid.
Officers of the City Council 37 said that they had and warned the Ministry of Education before a complaint. On midnight, there will be a press conference on which the complaint is formally announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will bring Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as a complaint and count eight discharged workers as complaints who are all colorful or latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the town's Justice Minister, said that the city is not before the complaint and thus can not be commented on its individual disappointments.
According to a draft complaint that proposed by the New York Times, the facility has been able to address the number of schools in the poor quarters of the city to submit a complaint for unbalanced treatment. She claims that poor schools would have lost more help because they were underfinanced chronicly.
It states that while there were no releases on Staten Island and only a few discharges in the high East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants in the 23th district in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 assistants were released in the districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five of eight school students in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students lived in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighborhood of visiting parents who can organize S.E. in order to get budget shortages."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was decreased at 3.26 Pro in this year.
The company also complains that the leaders of the High School were led by the language in a note, which authorised the release of maintenance coordinators.
The note used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: translating) in the United States usually describes the exchange of a teacher from a school content list in a pool of available workers paying by the central office.
"Six-six-six-six-six-six-six-coordinators were decided, not conversioned," the draft complaint.
End of mission, Congress will be ready to understand about Libya
Finally, it seems like the Republicans and Democrats in Washington were already to understand about the rebellion in Libya.
All that was necessary was the success of the revolution, the arrest and killing of the long-year dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the mixture.
On Thursday, the Committee for International Relations of the Senate concludes a resolution, which submits to President John Kerry (Masachussetts) with Senator John McCain and Joseph I. Lorrman (Connecticut), with Libya for the Rebellion and the United States of their "Mut" troops.
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have started with the rebuilding of their country," said Kerry.
"It is an action to support her democracy efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but until now it was nothing easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer the legislators of both parties and the white House strive about the vocabulary of a series of resolutions on the billion or deformation of the role of the US military in the Libyan mission of the NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain proposed a resolution which approved the restricted use of United States military powers in Libya.
The law was rejected by a wide range of both parties in the senate, and there was no vote.
However, on the same day, this law passed through in the senate. The Chamber adopted a decision to reduce the money for operations in Libya.
This leads to the US mission into a kind of legislational fire - with a congress that has been set up enough to criticize Obama's procedure in the context of the mission, but not enough to finally remove the ground under his feet.
Then the unfortunateness of the Congress was retained by the events.
Tripolis fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO Mission ended on 31 October.
Now the senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the International Relations Committee "congratulates the people of Libya for their great courage and their exceptional sustainers in their own freedom" and "lo" for their exceptional courage and professionality of the American military and coalition partners, who are undertaken by the military operations for the protection of people in Libya.
The resolution also confirms "the United States' national interests in an unrevolutive and democracy transition of Libya".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Board for Foreign Relations, or will they be divided by the legislators as it has been done in June?
The last replacement is the opposite of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the Spitzen-Republican of the Committee.
Lugars Speecher said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final replacement of the new law.
According to the chapter, the senate is to vote on a constitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget, a top priority at almost every congress legalisation period of the Republicans and some democracy.
The measures under the leading of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or of another area that comes at the time of voting in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried to make their amendments to vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatte change is only one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress and included a whole band size of the subjects.
Some are double - the same law was submitted both to the Congress and to the Senate - others only easily decline from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the change of compensation in the Senate and another duty that would "control the expenditure of the base".
Some of the laws are the same, but they give their employees - especially the beginners of the Republicans who want to pool their livelihood - the possibility that they have such a measure "invoked".
The budgetary control law, which was prescribed in August, requires that both Senate and Congress vote on a change in the budget balance.
In March, 58 Senators voted for a non-resolution which supported the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress can present, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to reject the limitation to two officials of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (I日nois) has proposed a series of amendments to ensure, inter alia, the right to education and healthcare.
An amendment prohibiting a marriage under equal sex is the same as an amendment that prevents the burning of faunas is a continuing model.
In addition, some legislators want to allow abolition of federal laws if two thirds of the States reject them.
As the members have proposed changes, they move faster as in the past years.
In the 11th Congress, 77 of these amendments were presented in 110. Congress 66.
In comparison with the early 1990s in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, the numbers provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more than those today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th was adopted in 1992, but it was actually proposed to the Congress already in 1789.
"Founded but not overwhelmed," so Gifford's first television interview after the attent
Ten months after a weaponsman from the next distance during a choice event in Tucson, the Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Ar ́na) came up in Montagabed at the national television. She solely sang to the Broadway truck "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said the desire to recover is greater than the one to return to the Congress.
When she arrived with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she called up by words and needed help to go.
The sending showed the severe slow recovery of the damage that the bottle that divided her shade, crossed the left side of her brain and made her head crossing from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned a surprise to the Congress to triumph her voice to debt breaches.
In his first television interview after the attack in January, when six people were killed and 13 were hurt, Gifford laughed, laughed and sang - and described their treatment as "difficulty".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41): "Ganz good."
The interview with Gifford and his husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a "20/20" special, which was opened shortly before publishing the new book of the marriage: "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."
The specialist follows Gifford's treatment since the attack of 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had opened in the first weeks, they are seen in the hospital bed, with a calf-raced head and a long scale over the star.
She can only take one or two fingers if her husband encourages her.
More months later, Giffords are sitting in a role chair, while therapies show her how they do simple moves.
A nick with the head.
A sugar with the lips.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords will say another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos playing in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's treatment: See how the Congress Deputy sang together with the terapeuts in Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
At the interview with Sawyer, Giffords said that every day two hours with therapy that she could not be reminded of the day of the attentate.
Her husband said that Giffords had forwarded an article of a daily journal on 12 March when she interrupted him and asked the six men who were killed during the attack.
The courageous Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is obliged to be treated medically while he is waiting for his negotiation.
"Several people are dead," said Gifford Sawyer.
"Heart, heart, heart."
During the healing of his wife, as Kelly Sawyer said, "I was found."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't overwhelmed?" Kelly said.
You're just met.
And you're going to take it up and you're going to get back and you're going back stronger than ever before.
Trups rather felt compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street-Gala that collected millions of obadachless veterinarians in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a stack there, hundred soldiers, matroses, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The quantity of black smokings arose and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the operation of the first year.
A strict military officer on the Gala, including observed by the staff head and then president, admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"You have been introduced as waisen children," wrote the officier in a mail.
I'm sure the organizers have made it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't a respect, really not, it was compassion.
The cracked contradictions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes wonderful public.
The troops are overcome with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise has his price, they say the service citizens.
The public still takes place as you eat people in uniform suffering.
"We were no way of sacrifice," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, the troops in Iraq will go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support is to press us into the role of unfortunate souls."
The subject is extremely sensitive to military leaders who want to appear not ungrateful or in the fight against the public they serve.
They also recognized that the wrath of the returning troops in the last years of Vietnam war was much worse.
Consequently, talks about mildness in silence and distress between war veterans are found.
After his two sons were returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a feeling of fear because they were rebellious and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether a "very violent, active veteran under the surface", said Cancian, who had fighted in Iraq and after his back, has taken a highly elevated state post in Washington.
In his work search, he said, he found that some of the applicants asked subtilly whether he was able to keep the pressure of a requesting post in Washington immediately after his back from the battle.
"If you talk about your service, you must keep the negative inputs against it," Cancian explained his sons.
The lack of the military facility is part of the missing interest of the Americans in the war.
Operations on the battle field are made by a country that has little experience with the military and only little benefits in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, just rarely expressed as lobby.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely usual in the Second World War," said Leutnant General David Barno a.D., the U.S. group in Afghanistan.
Instead of this, the praise of the public and the public is most important to the suffering of a member.
Trups find recognition for the number of attacks they have, the number of friends they have lost or for the difficulties of their damage.
Military is the growing pressure for hard transparency in administration
In this week, an important consultation will be decided whether 28 women and men are accused of not intervention in a military court.
If not, hundreds of complaints are ready for the next consultation.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when a soldier's colleague was charged by her night.
It was in October 2008, and she just went back to her casters in Miramar northward from San Diego from the dinner with a friend when she met a 12th pack beer.
He asked her if he should be with her on a drink in her room.
"My alarms went to," said Lyman.
But the Texanerin wasted her thoughts.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wanted to have heard my feeling of kiss."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stood behind her, kept her down and hurt her, claimed her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and early military employees waited terriblely for a process with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which a complaint which she had raised against the former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his advocates, Donald Rumsfeld, is determined to be approved in court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not been committed against the largely spread administration within the military and under the violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a legal advocate from Washington, D.C., included the complaint at the beginning of 17 complaints who increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who all claimed that they were committed or misuse by military colleagues, and that the military had distorted it, to determine, condemn or to provide a suitable legal prosecution after the consensus attacks.
Burke says she follows the main military leadership, since the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to break the culture's payment?
Burke also says that she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of them may be part of future complaints.
Your Property: Rather than all complainants put their eggs in a corb, they will, if necessary, introduce many other complaints to get the pressure upright.
The Defence Defence Minister Team, called by the Federal State Advocate Neil MacBride, has made a request to refuse the complaint.
The acts of the Court of Justice, which are presented in Newsweek, are explicitly the defence strategy, in particular that the military could not be accused of the current or former soldiers for injury to which it has come into the fighting forces.
According to a law of the Supreme Court of Justice of 1950, which is referred to as the Fere Doctrine, the Government does not have any damage to existing soldiers in the active service.
"The courageous damage occurred during the military service of the complaints," says the document.
The Defence Minister rejects any comment on this story.
The things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are not yet allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars have only rare fronts.
As in Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers' teams are still playing important roles, especially in contact with domestic women in the military areas.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in fighting.
It's time to modernize the military, says Burke.
And it is not only in her fight: three other complaints besides them are committed.
At the Yale Law School, the Veterans' legal services Clinic provides a complaint against the four main military academy for the courageous promotion of an enemy atmosphere.
It is independent that the useful Vietnam Veterans of America collects a complaint against the military in which you can address the diagnosis "Personality Station", which has received the immigration sacrifices to release them from the service - a usual procedure as anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network, a group of human rights.
In December, their group introduced a complaint against the Veterans' administration (i.e. the military veteranas) in which they preserved their discriminatory practices in their conduct with the performance claims for persons indicated that they were sexually misused in the service.
Nine laws were submitted to the Congress independently by a mixing of senators and representatives of both parties, which offer a number of points of stay.
According to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e. Office for Prevention and Notification of sexual abuse) of the Defense Minister 3 158 sexual misuse.
However, most misuses are not reported at all, and after its own deterioration of the Pentagon, this number takes into account about 13,5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases, which come to each year.
The report published in March also examines the penalties rates: 2010 20 per cent of the cases found in the military court, only half as the civil right.
The complainants in Burkes case describe their attacks as the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the courageous military police control less than one hour after the overcome.
This night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her administration of a whole series of cops, doctors and officers.
She had a murder and the blood of her river, which came from a cut on her arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was addressed by a judge. In the currency of this hearing, she was asked for the sex she had before her friend.
Six persons expressed character products in the name of the courageous tatter, which was finally released.
"I still remember the day when the sentence was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the wheels would be used, and I was crying out of the court room."
"They put me into the psychiatric division, and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander, "This was not his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatric who finally had a personality stage and explained it to be inappropriate.
In January 2010, it was disappointed so that it did not receive any support.
Whether the complaint, which Lyman and the other complainants have submitted, is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of legal science at the George Washington's Law School.
However, he notes, "They should be in front of my view."
What is between them and a sentence is this doctrine, which is criticized since it has been questioned for the first time.
I'm a criticist of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is running a year behind, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterioration that brings a debt with them.
He adds: "The chances are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, Burke, the advocate of the complainant, will begin with its hundreds of other complainants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until it comes to reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before he became to the new face of the legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration thinking online.
On Monday, Breivik, who stood to have walked in a amocycle in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, was his first public audience before the court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is not alone in Cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time before an attack of computers and has been chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who are right-extreme groups on the sides of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find more about these people.
But how can you find them?
It's easily - you just have to log in in Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main report of the British idea factor DEMOS on the digital popularism in Europe.
Facebook's Hidden of personal data is so encyclopædic, Bartlett says that researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the page to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as it has been done for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million Fans right-extreme groups throughout Europe and then referred to them with ads, but instead of connecting to a new band or a new diet product, the Adds users invited to an investigation in which their education, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 100,000 attachers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 countries - without having to leave their office only once.
"It's a very new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not surprised. Online frontiers of right-hand groups are most young, men and harm about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising distortion, "they who associate their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer images."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new warm tool in the hands of students.
Ideal factories, medical researchers and scientists use the page to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding three contents per day in the average, Facebook 'Datasupernova' generates a research tree that increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title in the last five years about 800%.
For some researchers, the niceness of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this page that usually are not reached with Clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to ask people of the British National Party before, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have given them access," said Bartlett.
"In Facebook all of this falls away - you're going directly to them."
Others say that the page offers an opportunity to recognize and solve social health problems.
A current term of Dr. Megan Moreno from the Wisconsin, Madison, and their colleagues, has found that students who discussed their completion on Facebook are significantly stronger than students who are weakening over this subject.
Moreno suggests that simultaneous students, such as resident advisers, monitor the page and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you didn't recognize it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko author and leader of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle of Washington Post.
"We have found an opportunity to identify children that have not been found otherwise."
Facebook also continues to focus on the data of his own population.
The data team of the page has created statistics on the relationship status and the Valentine day, election share in the inter- elections 2010 and a national happiness index (which was used in the first line of information that only Facebook has access - the master of digital freedom knows that the page should make its large data groups available for research.)
But Facebook users know that the page observes whether they want it now or not. In order to play Scrabble with a friend who is remote with thousands of miles, you are allowing the page to produce your own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a question of which they don't even know anything?
Current researchers have strictly defined guidelines how they collect their data offline, all are allowed online.
"I don't believe that many users have seen the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," Neil Selwyn, a sociolog at London Knowledge Lab, says to a absence from 2006, where he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"What she's about, it's just about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of the methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information is true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
So, despite his years, Selwyn thinks that a Clipboard and a staff are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no replacement to go out into the real world and talk to real people," he says.
"Social research needs to care for social - and every number of social life is still offline."
"Called and unmanual": Others Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
And otherwise, Behring Breivik, the man who held two amocalyptics, who killed 77 people in Norway in this summer, described himself in the first appearances before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistant movement and a Norwegian temple rider," he said before a court room with more than 500 people.
"I am committing the court because you have received your mandate from organizations, undergoing hazards, and because it is supported by multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I am not guilty."
Judge Torkel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologist, "He did not give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who introduced a preliminary talk, to turn to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also recommended that the Police Breivik holds in investigation for 12 more weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will control all searches and the entire correspondence within eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted the activation to stay behind the lock and rigel.
Everyone shared with the goal that everything was going out of a closure.
"I thought he worked cold and unmanual," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian sender NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me there's a piece further after I've seen the suspect and heard."
Breivik brought a dark and blue crawatte and worked hard and professional during the whole hearing. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes when he bought and left the building again.
Though Breivik's bizarre indication that he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not spiritually painful and said that there was no evidence that he had had a complex.
Some may feel that the attacks of 22 July seem to be the work of a individual extremist and not the group of radicals.
But does this automatically easily easily for the shoes and forefathers that still see a whole nation?
"I want him to look like a monster, but he doesn't," said the person of a victim.
"It would be so easier if he eats it."
7 Lections of interview with the devastated Steve Jobs shown this week in a theater
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5th, some compare him to Henry Ford and highlight the technology as a large modern finder.
But what Apple-Fans may find in the most recently discovered job interview, which was discovered in this week before special films on the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workshops in this week.
He was definitely a designer, a dreamer and self-designed hippie, but he was also an agryb organiser who was zealously battled on graphs - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from "a illness of thinking", "that a really great idea of the work... [but] there is a great quantity of handwork art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of Facidiotes" over the breakdown of the staff computer. And he sat longer than a hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, extensive talks.
At that time, there were 10 years since jobs were taken from Apple, and he was already hard on new computer enterprises NeXT, and he was glad for the wide adoption of the Internet.
As a small part of Cringley's interview was used in fachidiotes, he says that the copy tables of the interview were missing in the delivery.
First after Job's death, a full VHS copy was found in the garage of the director.
This easily over-film material is the foundation for the 68 minutes film "Steve Jobs: The lost interview", which comes to the landmark theater this middle and Thursday.
For someone who is able to take advantage of interviews, Jobs here appear zealously in the statement of his philosophy and business strategies.
And incrediblely thoughtful.
During the interview, there are four times to longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds in which Job clearly distracts his thoughts and has been attempted to accuracy.
There are also moments when Job's perfectionism comes to days when it seems to be unconscious to respond to Cringelys questions and let him go faster to the subjects or adverse treatments of greater importance.
Before the time of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview appears somewhat insecurely when jobs evaluate what other companies do right or wrong their opinion and represent their own view of the computer's future.
It is a thing to read posthume appreciations of Kare Jobs'. But Jobs here as the desired dreams that are on the shopping to greatness is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision how things could be and should be.
Soon after he had done all this here, he moved away and did it.
A quicker weather on seven noteworthy sequences of lost interview:
How he learned to conduct a company:
"I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, it's just done."
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in business really thinks about things.
I found it.
Jobs continues its efforts to analyze the accounting at Apple.
Increasingly, how the costs were opened - most of them were started with "standards", which were only involved in disturbance and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed a automaticized factory that ensured that the costs of business could be determined to the least.
How the dad was highlighted:
Jobs told the "Blue Box", he built with Steve Wozniak, a device to be able to join the phone company and other telephone talks.
The device has already been written a lot, but Job's appreciation when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-confirmation, it is amazing.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a responsibility phone, performing a call and then connecting from a AT&T network to another while they browse as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globus, and when you shoot on the phone, it came a minute later back on the phone," Jobs said kiching.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something that could control billions of billions of infrastructure throughout the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a huge thing, that was a great lesson and I don't think it would be without them Apple.
Jobs further told about a glorious strike, the Wozniak and he almost discharged when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the dad, while they were as well able to follow Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchie were invited in the middle of the night to talk to the diplomates, the two had to laugh before the father himself came to the phone.
How he loved the technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett call):
At the age of 12 years, when he looked for replacements to build a frequency numberer, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone, jobs received a share-time job at Hewlett-Packard for summer.
"It had a noteworthy effect on me. It was the only company I had seen in the age, and it formed my opinions on what a company was and how good it treated his employees."
Later, Jobs was one of the HP employees who visited the research lab of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer that has ever been produced".
He was as large as a coffee, had a small screen with Braunscher Rèe, and I loved it.
I would climb up at HP as teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve Innov:
More times in the interview, jobs are talking about how spontaneously finding new products.
Soon in his car, when he built some plates, he was asked by a customer to build the whole computer together.
He had only 30 days of payment and had to overview both the construction and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later in Apple he reminds himself of the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I'm reminding of the sustainable arguments... you cried to me that it would last five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could have made for $15. That was unbelievable.
About large enterprises that leave:
Long before he made Apple resume, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giganti were walking with their visions in stolpers and lost control over their actions.
"Do we say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copy or printer, after and after?"
You're taking action monopol, so the company's no longer.
Sales and marketing makes it more, so [without such people] that last lead the companies and the product with which people are taken from decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopolation will be required by people who have no concepts regarding products and bad products - handwork art.
It's done in Xerox...
Xerox could have made all the computer industry.
You could've been bigger, Microsoft could've been the 1990s.
You've denied the decline from the win.
About innovation as an artistic form:
"It's a lot of handwork art between a great idea and a great product... if you develop this great idea, it changes and wè."
You learn much about his enemies.
You must vote, certain things you can't, but electronics, glass, robots, factors.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and they all together...
Lastly, it's going out of the pleasure, it's also that you're trying to sit together with the best evidence that people have created and then try to bring these things together to what you're doing.
Picasso said to copy artists, to clothe great artists.
We're always insane in stealing great ideas.
The part of what Macintosh made great was that people who work there were musicians, distress, artists, zoologists, historians who were the best computer scientists of the world.
If it wasn't the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with enemies of the health law as a case
On the day the Supreme Court assembled doors closed behind to discuss the political shared question of whether to be heard of a protection of the health law of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and  firrence Thomas, took part in a dinner that was held by the office to represent the case before the court.
The incident occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met a meeting to consult the petitions for the examination.
One of the cases to be treated was a complaint that 26 states have raised against the greater health reform that had been committed by the Congress last year, a law which was held on the shock at the conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed with the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic disclosure will be expected in March, which will probably cause the presidential camp 2012, which will be at the time of the decision of the court.
The lawyer who stands before the court and claims that the law is to be broken will, of course, be Paul Clement, a general lawyer under the Government of George W. Bush.
Clements Kanzlei, Bancroft P′C, was one of the nearly two thousand companies supporting the annual dinner of the Federal Society, an old group dedicated to the defense of conservative law principles.
Another company represents the dinner sponsore, Jones Day, one of the economic associates, the National Federation of Index Business, who are fighting the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmacist Pfizer Inc., which was enormously shared in the result of the process.
The dinner found a few hours after the court had consulted the case in a Washington Hotel.
Service had, inter alia, Mitch McCon日, the Chief of the Republicans in the Senate and an explicit opponent of the health reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges visit events of the Federal Society since years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are released from the Code of Behavior, which regulates the actions of the underlying judges.
If they were, they would have fallen under the principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may share in benefit events closer to the law and other organizations, whereas the judge cannot be a speaker, honorable guest or a program.
Nevertheless, the extreme nearby of Scalia and Thomas arose to two of the branches relating to the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in this to alarm moral and governing activists.
"This confunding breaking with moral and the contrary to the Code is punishing the complaints of some judges of lies, the Court holds the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil right movement in the United States.
"The judges winned and died during a bone event with legal advocates with suffocating procedures at the court."
Their occurrence and support of a scheduled action for this event are subject to any claim of non-partiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little attention to critics who say that they would mix the case too easily with groups leading from the agenda, such as the Federal Society.
And the wife of Thomas Ginni is a conservative activist.
However, the conservatives claimed that it was Judge Elena Kagan, who had a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general advocate under the government of Obama when the first law campaigns were first in court.
Their critics forced Kagan to turn away from the hearing of the case because of the presence, because she was too engaged in the defence of the law to be unemployed.
Kagan doesn't make an officer to do this.
Boeing takes 18 billion record jobs to country
Emirate flight company orders 50 two-way flights from Boeing 777 with a option of 20 other flights.
Boeing six Boeing Dreamliner at Oman Air, a business in value of more than 1 billion.
It is really a rare message that a company gets a job over 50 parts of its products.
But it is a big business when the company of Boeing Co. is a boeing producer and the list price for these 50 flights is at a record of 18 billion.
It is also unusual that Boeing’s contractor is: the Middle East, a growing goldmine of future aircraft orders.
In a prognose published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that aircraft companies from the Middle East are required in the next 20 years of 2.520 aircraft in the value of 450 billion.
Boeing announced his biggest assignment on weekend for commercial aircrafts all the time, with the value of the order: 50 two-passed Boeing 777 Jets.
The hammer mission came from the Emirates Airport from Dubai.
The flight company also, as announced by Boeing on the Dubai aircraft 2011, has an option to buy 20 other flights that allow all the list price to increase to 26 billion.
Then, according to Boeing Oman Air, six boeing 787-8, the dreamliner, who is called the benzine consumption and the comfort of passengers, was very improved on Monday.
The list price for six of these aircrafts is more than 1 billion.
"It's absolutely positive for Boeing," Neal Dihora said, borseless man of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Flight companies from the Middle East are owned by oil producing countries.
So they have not only the money to pay the aircraft. Moreover, an increase in the oil price that normally harms the flights, since this is one of its largest cost points, is not so damaged because the country deserves an oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other flight companies to break or move aircraft orders when the oil prices grow, said Dihora.
"You have a natural insurance," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's position on the market for large-space aircraft and helps to keep the airbus competitor SAS in a shack that attacks the preservation with the A350.
Boeings wing on the airport will come four months after the airbus has announced, the introduction of the largest A350, which directly competites with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was removed to gain more confidence after the customers had requested a load of use and richness.
Boeing action increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister seems to lose choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the opponent of Fausto Vallejo has supported the PRI on the road around the government resistance.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seemed to have lost her request for the Office of the Governor of Muchoacan during the violently active state elections. She said on Monday, the traders would have influenced the running to one of their enemies.
According to the provisional results, Fausto Vallejo won the institutional party of the Revolution, the PRI, running around the government resistance in the Western State.
"The intervention of the organized crime during the entire election process and especially on the grievous day is alarmant, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview one day after election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys ... you have taken election cabins, built road blocks ... and ordered people to vote [for the Pri]."
The PRI ruled seven years in Mexico until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they strive to return and win in Michoacan is a important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only been shortly struck, which had led in the surveys before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative Partido Action National PAN of her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the Left Democratic Revolution Party PRD, who is currently still an official Governor, came to place Three, a severe reduction for the divided and unlucky left leader for the presidential election 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the provisional results.
Vallejo, an ancient citizen of the capital of Morelia, lies to negotiate connections and forces the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been dominated by cards that have been specialized on Marihuana, heroin and amphetamine.
It is the home country of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to start a militaryly conducted Offensive against trademakers in December 2006.
Violence still takes place.
A PAN citizen was killed a week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates were exhausted from local elections.
For the PRI a victory strengthens the party, regardless of how constantly the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is deceived to represent the PRI in the road around the president's office, Enrique Pena Nieto, the Vallejo from Washington, and said, "I think this victory will let us look courageously for the next year."
ADB forces Asia to help in the salvation of the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (Asia Development Bank, ADB) calls for India and China to undermine the salvation of the euro zone in its serious debt crisis to prevent a long-term discharge that will reduce the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director of the ADB with Sitz in Manila, said that both of the world's most rapidly growing economies must do "all things in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the election block either through the International Election Fund or direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brasil, Russia, India, China), the "lossless" looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of the leaders and the resources through Asia would help prevent a long-term breakdown of the global economy.
"We're all sitting on the same ship."
"So is everyone who can help Europe from this crisis," he said the Financial Time in an interview at the border of the world economic for in Mumbai.
"Asia may be scared up to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all the means."
Europe's election Union has gone into a serious debt crisis in the past months.
In the past, Italian tax costs increased annually, and the Prime Ministers returned from Italy and Greece.
The coming severe debt crisis in Europe threatened the global economy to be broken into the recession and led to calls, the leader countries had to join to submit the euro zone.
Mr. Nag foretold that all Asian support was channelized by the IWF, but said that mutual agreements, such as the purchasing of bonds of the EU Saving Fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) offered greater negotiations to the partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "When everything that is in his power will be done" to help the euro zone, because the own economy is now suffering under the deceased exports and the exhaust outcome of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the euro zone to remain instabil and turbulent," he said.
"We are faced with great challenges and we have to get a high growth level."
"It's no option, it's a job, for where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economics such as India have no incentive to help the Europeans if they are in the case of great economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor of the US Brown, said that it would be politically very difficult to overcome the 1.2 billion people in India to help Europe, from which more than 800 million of two or less lives on the day.
"Everyway, they will find out that the Greeks with 50 are going to rent and feed on the beach, and then there's a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Director of the World Economy, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to maintain the numbered and well-paid employees in the public service, with workplaces in bad way, losing facilities such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the crisis in the Eurozone will have "significant dominion effects" in all Asia.
ADB's prediction with a economic growth of 7.5 Pro in Asia for the years 2011/ now threatenes "the risk of degradation" due to threatening Europe.
He said that hurtful sweet markets must create "Christian plans" to make itself for a divorced trend and a significant capital immigration of their vocabulary.
Driving warnings from the pentagon against possible incidences in defence
Defence Minister Leon Panetta invited the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget reductions would weaken the national security unremarkablely, so that he solved a financial reaction from the Pentagon Halls to the military areas in Afghanistan and the civil flood bands.
The Pentagon already thinks of 450 billion shortages during the coming decade, but now fear that further shortages of 600 billion or more will be needed if the Congress can't end the decades.
"The effects of these shortcomings would be devastating for the Ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain, Arrêta, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a claim of the Congress in achieving a budget agreement, which will lead to such a decrease, would lead to 23% of general reductions and a stop of a number of new projects.
"That's a high shortage, performed in such an unexpected way, would make most of our ships and building projects incomplete - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously damage," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also have been forced to separate ourselves from a majority of our civil staff and, since the reduction would be so quickly implemented, we should allow civilians to achieve the objective with a security of limited probability."
"These changes would be the faith of those who have our military upright and seriously harm our alarm preparation."
The shortcomings were finally met with the fighting groups," Panetta said.
"When the war-time quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the attack, the serious intervention in the basic budget would affect the efforts of war," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been reduced, which would lead to delays in the setting and setting surveillance of wars."
"The staff's residents would be reduced, which leads to later payments to war-seakers and would be affected by legal and political support."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and requested further details about the potential impact of automatic shortages on the Defence Minister.
"The consequences of the obscene of the Defence Minister would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the leading military power of the world."
"We are extremely contrary to this draconic action," the senators said in a common statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result we can't live with, and it's certainly nothing to force us."
"The arrest is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entrance should not be paid."
Whether the Panettas letter and the new senator's warnings will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will enhance requests to exit the pentagon of shortages.
Panetta continued to discover the possible shortages, although he could collect many years of experience with the budget in the Congress and in the White House before he arrived to the top of the Pentagon, and he knows that he stands against serious decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Minister made a dark picture, which could be expected - a military with shale, but without nuclear.
"It's a ship without matrose."
"It's a brigade without munition."
"It's an aircraft without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, a army of the casters, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to fulfil the mission," Panetta said in his exhibition in Pentagon.
"It is a fighting force that lacks moral and alarm preparation and that is not able to get up with potential enemies."
"He lets a real whee."
In an attachment to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta reported new details how reductions "significant operative risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions of our worldwide use and entertainment, which lead to an inacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects of the strike could fall to the victim, those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list also belongs to the campsite F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bombing planning, the next generation of ballistic U-boots, the new Literal Combat Ship and the new ground fighting vehicle, the army and marine need to replace the houmvee.
If you would stop the further development and test of F35, this would simplify in the next 10 years up to 80 billion, but the Before say that it is a more important step to equipped, so that possible engines can be designed by China and other enemies.
How to discover a lie
An angle on the current rows shows how distressful and largely spread shame and lies are in the daily life.
The Presidential candidate of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is committed to become the accusations of sexual injury from several women, both sides regard each other to lie.
The Guide of Penn State is accused of myself because reports have been reported, after which a pensioned football track of boys have been sexually misuse.
Last week, the French president Nikolas Sarkozy, President Barack Obama, was a member of an open microphone when he said that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lights of deep career and deterioration of countries.
The New York Congress Deputy and Internet Exhibi of Anthony Weidner became a fool when he rejected disappointments that were very quickly rejected by indispensable evidence.
The former presidency candidate John Edwards is accused of the violation of the campaign financing, which is related to the deterioration of an external business.
And then, of course, no one who has learned it forgets the median circus, president Bill Clinton, when he lied during his second office in Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about shoes in school and at college tests are broadcast.
There were events in which the teachers presented their students the answers to the tests so that they did well in their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and shoes are all right.
How much do we experience?
As shows, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
However, these lies are considered to be lying.
Another area shows that foreigners lie each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "recovering lies" is one that is important to learn for every person, and this is for both personal and for difficult reasons.
From a social game such as sharaden, for example, in which it is the goal of calling "After you!", it is a serious area of discovery based on scientific data that has been collected in the past six years of viewed universities that have performed large research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
A result of research is that most old myths have been discovered about lies.
Liars look at one in the eyes.
They're stopping, stealing, rejoicing, and not always moving.
However, it is not possible to conclude that these lies are hard to discover and discover.
A practiced lying mentor can go through the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine expressions of the face, the question and the time.
I have spent several years to examine the scientific results of the comprehensive and constant growing area of deterioration, and it is clear that discovery of a disturbance is a modern ability to learn and help us in the property of our complex world, especially if the setting or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration belongs to our own responsibilities.
Good lies are very good in appreciating other people to wake their interest and control their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they are understood by others.
Thanks to research, the extroverted people are more frequently liars than introverted people that men often "the most oriented" lies are optical than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" -- usually, they want to sing the feelings of others - that married people are less often liars than unmarried people (but the lies they say are most "fair lies").
We also know that when a person has been disappointed as a criminal, others feel less guilty of being enjoined of this person.
How do you recognize whether someone's on?
First by watching the normal behavior of this person.
It's called "baselining", the start position.
It provides a reference point to the later assessment of changes.
Watch the attitude, laughing, the voice quality of their test person.
You should better know where usually someone triggers with the foot, so they don't accuse him wrong when he triggers with his feet during a meeting.
Then take care of accurate verbal and nonverbal behaviour.
Consider these adhesions as alarms that shoot, not as a evidence of disturbance.
People who are crazy may surprise if they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet show themselves in the direction of the door or they refuse to go out, change their position in significant way or show a "rejoice after the conversation", this deep, relaxing spirit and the change in the attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questioners often falsely signal that a conference is over, only to keep after this relaxation after the discussion.
Take also care of the language of your test person.
The exhibitor of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his murdered wife was still alive and solved a national search for her.
The Germans can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeated a question at all.
The most common verbal signs are subtil.
Some people use "qualitime language", when they answer a touching question: "Now... to tell you the truth... as far as I have ... after best and consciousness."
This will make the answer more sensitive than real, as often the alarm bullets shoot.
There is no tuberculosis to exhaust lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to them a discharge is possible.
Thanks to these abilities, everyone can be rarely victims of disappointment, both in both professional and professional life.
Conflicted plan of oil pipeline is overwhelmed by sustained US authorisation
A few days after the Obama Government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline of Canada in Mexico Golf, which enraging the communities and emphasising the environment at the same time, the Pipeline building undertakings have attempted to plan the project to return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening to transfer the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of Sandhills to Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliamentary building.
Alex Perbax of TransCanada said that the company is continuing to be confident that the Pipeline is finally approved, though with another history.
This occurred after an announcement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision was made regarding a Federal Assessment for the project until the new possible history was checked, which prevented the area of Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Acquifer, a large subwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental examination, which has been appointed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, may take a decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, even if officers denied that they were more involved in the decision.
Obama explained last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said its support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to Canada's golf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 Barrel oil per day from the province of Alberta to the raffiners in Texas.
This is what the pipeline has to cross through six states.
They hate the environment, but they love the work markets because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 200,000 jobs.
However, the legislators of Nebraskas, who are against the plan, dismiss the laws to force a department from the region of Sandhills and Ogallala Acquifer, a main source of drinking water and beverage.
The current aspect of the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project had only little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy states that the Master Minister has requested a separate form of the review procedure that could address two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist established by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was consulting by Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether an undertaking ordered to carry out the original Property was an inappropriate choice because it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle complained because she probably forced a little boy to breathe
A New Yorker family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the Lobby of her Manhattan building would have received an attack on tobs, which would have made her little daughter so much that she had given herself before.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" song made the 18 months old Genevieve Monk so that she suffered from "personal changes, slaughter" and "increasing before foreigners", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was the past 10th year when the feet worker Kevin Monk, his wife Rosena, a child garden, and Genevieve wanted to stop a family flight.
As Kevin Monk sold the car, Roseons Monk went with the packaging and Geneva on his arm to the lobby in his building at Riverside Boulevard.
Roseons Monk said she stopped near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
"No one shot behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter just does?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on the hand," she said.
LaBelle encouraged the pregnant woman who.
"You said in a aggressive sound, "You shouldn't stop your daughter near the door," said Rosons Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She was wounded and began to shimp -- she used the F-word and the A-word and became very sound...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to kick water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become histerical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle struck on the mother who still had Genevieves on his arm, and needed to be kept away from her advice and to be held to a waiting car, said Roseons Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to be delivered, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family wrote to apologize, but he did not answer.
LaBelles legal lawyer and representative did not respond to calls in which a opinion was requested.
The complaint is a non-determined damage replacement, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he did not take account of the honourator and plans the family, the money that she gets, the child cancer assistance will be taken.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take the responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is absolutely inacceptable, especially when it is placed on the day that a 18-month old baby is on the arm."
Climate distortions broke the economy
In the first year, where Mario López Valdez was at the government, the unemployment and black work increased in Sinaloa while the foreign investment returned and the economic stagnated.
In 2011, the economic history of Sinaloas will remain in memory. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who takes itself as the initiator of the change and harms great hopes regarding the economic growth, is at the government. However, according to climate deficiencies, it can not be the speech of growth, but the main economic indicators have been deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February caused not only losses in millions of agriculture, but also decreased the growth of the state economy and caused a general decrease of the economic activity by 3.6% in the first fourth year. This is mainly to the historical reduction of agriculture development by 31.16%, which affected more economic sectors.
According to a report issued by the Council of Mexican para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the impact of the Frost, 582 000 hectares of agriculture-used lands were protected, of which 78.03 Pro and the remaining 21.07% were partially decreased.
The reduction of the economic activity until November has continued to increase the unemployment in the Mexican State. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geography observed a rapid increase in worklessness in the first fourth year, since from January to March 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment, which corresponds to 4,53 Pro of the employment population. In the second quarter, the rate of unemployment increased to 5,28% and from July to September to 6,19%, which has 74 000 unemployment in Sinaloa. These are 18 969 more than in the first fourth year.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year returns to several experts. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dekan of the University of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments that express the growing unemployment of the public institutions.
"What we currently observe is an increase in labour unemployment that has to do with several persons; in addition, with liquidity losses on the market, as a result of the reductions in the legislation which has been intended to combat the monetary weapons in the Congress, because it is not easy for those who are attached to the prohibition, to allow them to work, to invest or to use them for something else," he explained.
Migration arrested
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment also resides in a demographic.
"The number of people who leave the country on the search for work in the foreign land, especially in the United States, has been returned, on the one hand, leading to the income problems and on the other hand because it is difficult to find work in it. These people remain here and seek work here, which allows unemployment to grow," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the work in Sinaloa is even more serious if you take into account the high percentage of black work, which includes in accordance with INEGI 60.38% of the employees in the country who work without paying in the cases of social insurance.
For unemployment and black work, the lowest salaries in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Agency) and the Secretariat del Trabajo y Prevision Social (Registry for employment and social care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of the employees in Sinaloa was until September 5352 Peso, which is much less than the average of the national income of the pesos.
Return of the ADI
In addition to the reduction of economic activity and growing unemployment, in 2011 the highest reduction of the foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last years would be decreased. According to Secretaria de Economy (State Economy) the ADI corresponded to an injury from January to June 630 597, which corresponds to a decrease of 87.74% in comparison to the 5 143 312° during the previous year.
The Secretariat de Desarrollo Economic del Government (Government for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, which originates in the tertiary sector.
The Debts
In view of the economic crisis, the Government of the country requested in July, at the National Congress, a credit of 3 000 000 000 pesos, which should be invested in the 18 common infrastructure projects. The country congress approved a amount of 200 600 000 pesos, however, no positive impact on the debt on any of the industry in the country until November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the undertaking, the first government year, Mario López made Valdé's government incapacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the Camera Nacional de la Industria de la Transformation (the State of the processing industry in Mexico) claimed that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of the various sectors, the Government of the country.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very powerful this year. It must be hard to achieve the lost territory in this year, and 2012 we have to strive doublely. The efforts of all, especially the progress of the already agreed government team, have not been sufficiently agreed to each other," he explained.
Slow economic development
Loredo López stated that events such as Frost at the beginning of the year would be difficult and slow.
"The small economic flow is the result of several events, i.e. the Frost. One of the most important effects, is a sustainable economy that is not sufficient in moving to generate a economic dynamic that could create an acceptable flow of processes, products and services, and therefore we will end the year far under our expectations," he said.
Redefine vocation
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation Patronal de la Republic of Mexico (Mexican Employment Company) said in Sinaloa that the State should be assigned to dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that it has been done; we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to re-determine the economic vocation and line of the country because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloas," he said.
There's much to do.
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that links the Government's efforts in better trains.
"In general, I would say that the Government has achieved results in various areas; the economic development has come forward, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he explained.
He stressed that the current State power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas that can be said that the government has acted more completely; what I can say is that it has been done and that the government is aware that there is a lot of work before her," he said.
Prison for 8 kg of Marihuana
At five years of prison and 100 days of prison, a resident of Navolato was condemned because of the possession of eight Kilo Marihuana.
The State Advocate of the Republic gave that the small trademan was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a criminal against public health - here the property of Marihuana to trade.
According to the Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by mexican military soldiers in the monitoring of the road of Cipriano Valdez against wakepost no 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trader entered a white car in which he kept a black cup in a box in the car and kept a small rubber in which the soldiers found eight kilo and 23 grams of Marihuana.
For this reason, the obsessed product was transferred to the judge of the District and the penalty continues to be in the full trial.
Debts for building work
The social buildings for migrants are running in the programmes Habitat, Rescate de Spacios Publicos and 3x1, not to be completed due to failure or only with a great delay, Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The leader of the State of Social Development Authority stated that, despite the progress of the building programmes, they are now in a position because the government has not paid its advanced resources over 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes was nearly 50 million peso, from which 25% were fallen into the state, and that until now only the Federation and the community would have contributed to the building work, so it would have been expected a delay of building.
"12 million of them must be charged, and although the year is over, they have not given us a penny, and that, even though they had already had to give us a part in July," he said. "To not be too late, we have already started with the building work, and they have already been far advanced, but we need the money."
He highlighted that under the Government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not fulfilled its obligations, therefore the congregation had to take a credit of 7 million at the beginning of its government.
"This has already been our way in the last legislative period, because the State does not have sufficient economic resources; the programmes continued and we have had to get the funds that the State had not established to share in these programmes," he said.
Even if the State authorities were committed to payment of these funds, he commented that the Ministry of Administration and Finance was requested to accelerate the administrative work and to pay the extent as quickly as possible.
"But 12 million of them have to be charged, and though the year is over, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transformation of analogues to digital signals is the most important changes in the world in the past years.
The Supreme Court of Justice Mexico (SCJN) states the constitutional claims submitted by the Senate and the Master House against the Presidency class, and the force to provide for the exchange of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to eight abstaining votes required for laws.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Master Court of Justice, Juan Silva Meza, was the opinion that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed his competences when he issued the legislative decree with details on the exchange of digital television on earth.
This decision rejected the constitutional fight called by the Senate because he did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court could decide about the constitutionality or non-constitutionality, so that the law remains in force.
In the draft complaint, which was issued by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the law decree for constitutional non-constitutional, since the Commission Federal de Telecomunications (Cofetel) would be responsible for the radio and telecommunications regulations related to the Commission Federal de Telecommunications (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), therefore the law decree would correspond to hierarchic principles and regulations.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero were voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Deputy Constitutional Chamber have committed complaints against the law decree; after the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero has no longer introduced the legal decree and has introduced all activities to establish the digital transfer.
The Ministerial Council also refused the complaint submitted by the Deputy Chamber without income in the debate on the project for which also was responsible Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In the contribution of the Minister, the President expressed not to agree with the arguments of the project, but that the Government of the countries could not regulate the measures to take public administration by general rules.
"I don't believe that if you do this, it would affect the independence of the regulatory body." She also noted that for the planning of strategic areas, such as telecommunication sector, the central government is responsible for constitutional reasons because it leads to state matters.
The replacement of the analogue signals by digitals is one of the most important changes found in the past years in the world, and it makes better use of the radioelectric spectrum, a higher quality of the signal and more channels.
The subsequence of the transformation, she said, would be an exhibition of the use of digitalization, which is a decision in public interest, which does not only have technical viewpoints, "which includes economic, social, political and technical aspects".
These matters, she emphasised, "as necessary for the operation of the whole system, in accordance with the principle of the economic governance by the State, included a group of characteristics putting the Constitution into the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries had already conducted the digital transformation worldwide, although they were overgoing highly specialized institutions.
It is not possible to conclude that the Government will enter into the powers of the Congress with the issue of the advocated law decree, because the laws would be complied with the legislative decree," she assured.
The opportunity to calculate the voting point in Michoacán is given individually in addition.
According to PREP, the subdivision between the first and the second place of the Governor's election is approximately 27%, and 879 votes of the total 6074 votes have not yet been counted.
The possibility of the single voting records is a reality in the elections in Michoacán in this year, since, according to the data issued by the Programme de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the subdivision between the first and second place of the Government's elections is about 27%, and 879 votes of total 6074 are not yet counted.
In this regard, the President of the Council General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that the electoral office on the last 9 November had proposed a series of rules to harmonize local rules with the reforms of the States in elections.
It is noted that Michoacán did not enter into force his political constitution, nor his election law, nor his election law on election justice to the reforms which had been adjusted by the Congress, so that they did not enter into force in this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State indicator within the time limits with the argument, and no consequences.
On 9 November, the Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional claim submitted by the local legislation and assessed the vote of the State official to the Constitutional Reforms as "invalid and injurious" because he does not have the right to "determine or impose a Veto against it".
María de los Landeles Landeral, in an interview, explained the possibility of a single statement of votes that, thanks to the adoption of Directives by the Council General del IEM, the opportunity for the local electoral to share or complete the voting records.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more election packages are partly not complied with the results of the protocols; the voting and voting protocol is not actingly present or it is not in the owner of the electoral Board or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols.
The total exhibition of the total elections completely issued may be made if there is a difference between the mute-making winner and the one on the second place that is equal or less than a procurement, provided for at the start of the meeting, there is a explicit request from the Partie, etc. Coalition president, which is the second of those candidates.
The voting statement may also take place in its entirety if, after the end of the ordinary procedure, the subdivision between the mute winner and the candidate in the second place is equal or less than a pro-type, it is provided that there is a express request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the election packages, which have been issued a partial calculation, would be excluded.
It is evident that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to the PREP of the subsection between the first and the second place, approximately 0.16 Pro, though the votes of 129 by a total of 923 election protocols have not yet been counted.

The young man remembers that even in the age of seven years to Zapopán, he was led to the graduation of his family. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he did: a flight.
A last breakdown
The leader of the Mexican Air Weapons, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was prejudiced by the Governor Jorge Torres López with all honours. His honour gave him the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican air weapons, school leaders and students of Saltilo's educational office, where he studied in 1985, and was also in the sports as a greatest.

Middleweek education of the new Italian Government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, is coming tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that was to offer the crisis that Italy led to the border of the economic cohesion.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, is coming tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that was to offer the crisis that Italy led to the border of the economic cohesion.
A message from the presidential Palace announced that the Monti named on Sunday would take place with the State President Giorgio Napolitano on midnight to visit the government training.
It will be concluded that it will represent a majority of technocrates, even though it is not clear when the new president will attend his office.
Monti said that he would present to the President the results of the discussions with the political parties on government training.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to be completed with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner said to the journalists.
Monti did not practice the government's training explicitly, but his comments show that the obstacles were overwhelmed.
"The frame is now well hidden," he adds.
Monti has been able to create a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, and the currency of Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis which has exposed the costs of debt to an inevitable height.
The new government, leaded by the former Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard spar package required by the Europolicies to win the proposed confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti was still strengthened by the pregnancy marketing plant due to the charge of the Italian statement for 10 years with 7 percent of interests, which corresponds to the position in which Greece and Ireland were forced to promote the salvation scenario.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian Industrial Verband Confindustrie, shared the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would submit this government after all powers."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this situation.
The successful opportunities of Montis were significantly increased by the support of the PDL party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to return on Saturday according to the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are determined to achieve results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Mediterranean Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is essential, since many of their members have yet spoken against a majority of the government of technocrates, which is just designed by Monti.
Assistance by Parliament
The new Government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the probably unemployment measures.
Opposition to its efforts or the deterioration of reforms may again affect a deteriorating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian band of foreign banks exercises with indication that Montis is a disaster, also pressure.
Monti started on Monday with his debates with political parties, associations and entrepreneur associations, as well as with young and female organizations.
The session round shall be completed on the day of service.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has made an extremely fast government change in the crisis.
After recent breathes at the end of the last week, when Berlusconi would return, the uncertainty of the success of the new president has reached the costs of the Italian State Limitation.
It would be too much for the current EU safeguard.
Monti said that his government had to take up until the next elections that would probably be kept in 2013, despite the prophecy that the people would only give him time to implement reforms, rather than to predict the elections.
Monti stated that he would like to take it more into his cabinet, but the large parties are concerned that it should be consistent only of technicians, a reference to their thoughts in view of the procedure established by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that mutual disbelieving and unity between parties makes the integration of individuals from the political life complex.

In addition, experiences with Spanish fury in complicated divorce games in Eurocope and football universities.
However, the Tico footballs have few international meetings in the context of the Concacaf, which is fully below the FIFA raillist.
We will see how the Spanish multitude takes its last ruler: the Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached the last Saturday against England (Download 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign players with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will be playing against the three colored community today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.

The Quintett engaged Costa Rica in his tour to celebrate his twenty-year-old existence
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that performs"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, the bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared for giving the next Sunday in the national station one of its best concerts.
More than 20 years they were expected, but the band assured that a dream was made for them when they were playing in Costa Rica.
This assured the bassist and with the founder of the group, Jeff Ament, the Viva last week of Brazil from an exclusive interview.
The band is in the South America part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year existence and on Sunday, 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they arrive from 19.30 a.m. in the national station with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read an extract from the talk that is to find a complete copy in the online issue of La Nation.
For your catarican fans, a dream is performed when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Do you know what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also works for us.
This is just the second time we play in South and Central America, and it has been great until now.
I was just once for the vacation in Costa Rica. It's a beautiful country that we're gonna stay there for a few days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely delivered, they experience the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most pleasant fans?
Thank you for standing on our side all these years.
We had almost 21 years until we arrived to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long, and it's sorry that we needed so long as we came here.
Some people even think that your concert will become the greatest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure out of your cup?
Some of the greatest shows we have set in the last 21 years have found place in the last two weeks.
We played some rieshows in Sao Paulo and hoped they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we have a pleasure to play there.
We love this country, we like to survive and we are enjoyed by Dschungel, which belongs to Costa Rica's best countries in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and his whales to surf?
Our friends are surfer and I have a great friend who is in Tamarindo le, where the whales are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always moved to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico are the excellent areas to surf. In this way, about people who love surf, we have learned about this.
With a corner on the tour, you offered riesenhows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we're not putting any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a repository and a multilateral repository.
You never repeat your repository.
Why?
I think that is partly because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 lits. Everyone likes another song so that the decision that we will play is not easily falling.
If we take two or three songs we have no longer played in the repository, we can get our con­forcing better up and surprise us because they call us the reasons to remember why these songs liked us.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore also for the public.
With this tour, you celebrate your 20-year-old history.
If you look back, is it difficult to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
Once I believe that no one of us has imagined to play once in a great rockband, and that's more than 20 years.
We are also putting on these blessings and finding it wonderful to be able to make music together even now.
We love and we are pleased to bring music out.
We have the lucky to go to the places of the world that we always wanted to visit.
The things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have participated actively in the birth hour of the greenhouse?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of large bands.
We are well friends with people of Sound Garden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing and richly unusual when a movement from a group of friends comes out.
Go and again, a band comes out of a city, but it is already unusual when five or → groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and we feel honest to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we're still playing together.
Last year, we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney, and we saw sound gardens on their tour. We are glad that we are still friends with them all and honored to be part of this seattle sounds.
It is also very unusual that a band as yours has stayed with the same musicians so long.
Yes, four of us have played together since 21 years and Matt (Cameron) has been 13 years ago. This is a lot more time than many bands to overcome.
Once I believe that we all appreciate the happiness of being alive and we also care for each other.
We all are a close friend, therefore we have opened musical ways that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music.
Your relationship with praise is not always easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you think a balance?
The way we are weakened has made us easier to find a balanced weight.
We make sure not too often to be on tournee, because it is too easy to fall this game with great human masses that love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of music, it reminds you that you must take care of the music and what she called in the life without being a famous rock star. That has never been interested in us.
What reminders do you have in your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we have written very songs and it was great at first.
We were a band for three years that had never issued a plate until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed about how long we had been used. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I remember what was for an incredible man Andy and how he laughed me. It was always a joy to go to work and to laugh together and talk about music and football and many other subjects.
He was an extraordinary person and we missed him.
The inland band Las Robertas is responsible for the exhibition of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and therefore you have chosen the band to vote?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band is best for us. So we are interesting in seeing what Las Robertas can offer live. This will certainly be exciting.
Why do you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play alive?
This is a question for Eddy Vedder, I don't know.
He sing to him, and I think he's singing the first thing he can.
Who have you been influenced as a bassist?
From so many+
The first to me belong to Geezer Butler, John Detwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many that I could talk about the bassists I like.
How has Pearl Jam succeeded to keep the greenhouse in life, although it isn't a appearance anymore?
I don't think we all feel very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think of this, the bands I've previously learned, for example, Mudhoney, Sound Garden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find it great, for it is rewarded to hear this music and bands like Mudhoney now make music better than ever before.
First, her music was dark, now it's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are some songs on the new album that could do something easily. But there are also other liquors such as The End or Just Breathe that are considered as very dark songs, even though they have something positive on themselves.
I had the dreams to both when I heard how Ed was playing. It's very dark songs.
I believe that if you are older and some traumatic in your life - for example, if you lose a family family or a friend - it affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly to me.
But I am also thinking that you can be a happy man and yet make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for your studies
The former president Alberto Fujimori was delivered to a public hospital in order to examine the muscle loss of his legs on Tuesday, informed his household.
The 72-year Fujimori, who is detained 25-year prison for the violation of human rights during his government period (1990-2000), has several diseases, language cancer, which operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congress member and his personal argue, said to the TV that Fujimori would examine three days in the Peruanian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas in order to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the bottom of the body.
Aguinaga commented that his opinion could be granted to Fujimori for humanitarian reasons, yet he did not want this because he thought it was innocent.
He was operated four times in tongue cancer and he lost 18 kg weight. Additional diseases such as a severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the kidney speech, renal stones, blood pressure and blood transfusion problems in the feet, the arreal.
Fujimori has been located in der Haftanstalt National Direction of Special Operations of Police since September 2007.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for murder of 25 persons by the deathsquadron of the Peruan army, which was secretly executed during his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
A official departure referred to by the Uruguay President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs starts on Sunday and Mexico to expand the trade between both countries and political issues of the region
Mujica will meet mexican official colleagues Felipe Calderon next midnight. This will be, according to the Uruguay president, the top point of its issued date plan, business officers and a meeting with the collector of the Uruguayer living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "seeing the exchange of information on all areas between the two countries" was given by the president of the South America Office on its website.
According to local media, Mujica searched for Calderon's support regarding the interaction with France when the French Governing Boss Nicolas Sarkozy at G20's Gipfel meeting in the French city Cannes set the South America country on a list of tax paradises.
In discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still occur as a tax paradise, from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and made a request to messengers in the country.
Since November, Mexico has the G20 presidency, a group consisting of the most powerful countries of the world. Since January this year, there is an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double investment with the South America country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has attempted to accelerate the confiscation of agreements on exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "great list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and countries which have not introduced all international standards for tax cooperation.
A free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been made on business level since 2004, which has contributed to an increased exchange of goods between the two countries.
The snippet installer is involved with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought about the salvation of Princess Peach from the clouds of the bad bowser for 25 years, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D land" he fights about the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that this month comes to the laden teams of all the world has been cut off from the beginning to the characteristics of the tragic console Nintend 3DS, with which it can be played without a special brilliant three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that must say how the stereoscopy works without brille," Omar Álvarez, responsible for the specialized press in Spain in the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo developed from the beginning to this console" because until now there were success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adjustments already existing title.
The speaker of Nintendo stressed that, although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D country" is a "super-super" video game that allows a quick, liquid game.
Alvarez assured that "Super Mario 3D country" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to start the less shaken users.
Afterwards, experts over the different levels of games that are always more difficult can turn a "double".
In reality, users can choose between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles, without being victims of the "optical effects" must always be played three-dimensional.
This flight Super Marios into the three-dimensional world also means the back of the figure to a tragic console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo wins the fans of the Saga and repeats the successful reception of the last deals: The faster installer has to overcome with spitted platforms to free the princess Peach.
However, the player strikes news about movements, environment, clothing and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom for the delivery of Portillos in the United States
The President of Guatemala, Alvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would place the delivery of the former Governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible for the charge of 70 million dollars in the United States.
This is the end of the procedure on the request of the United States for the delivery of Portillo, so that it may be presented before the court.
At a press conference, Colom, his decision was based on the independence of justice and the government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already assigned the delivery.
He emphasized that during his Government he did not mix in judgments and had placed all the requests for delivery that he had been informed.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin is delivered for murder and severe body damage, Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Esrada Paredes, both for trade.
The Coloms action is a Government act that shall be carried out when all judicial and constitutional institutions are executed to condemn the former president of the station (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Court of Justice and the Constitutional Court of Justice of Guatemalas, Portillo must be delivered when its law is confirmed in Guatemale and guaranteed human rights.
Portillo was released for the submission of 120 million Quetzales in the Defence Ministry during his Government's time, and this negotiation was preliminary for the delivery, but the Minister repeatedly revoked the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people, threatened by social exclusion
The organization was invited to avoid the marginalisation of young people without professional training.
The first 25 years of life of the Social Assistance Organization of Trinijove have resulted in important results: In this fourh hundred, 6000 young people were supported by social exclusion to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, over 100 jobs created for this social group.
At the date of the anniversary, the previous workshops of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 persons participated, had been held in a event in the former work buildings of Fabra i Coats.
Trinijove was called in 1986 in the city quarter Trinitat Vella with the goal to help young people with small education, without work, with problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
A number of responsibilities from institutions and institutions that have been united in these 25 years have participated in the festival of San Andreu.
The participation of political representatives of different directions in the electoral fighting periods was the inpartiality of the work carried out by Trinity.
Besides the President of the Generality (Parlament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas and Others Landi Pujol participated in the festivals of the former socialist educational minister Ernest Maragall and the former citizen master and currently left-green city Council Ricard Goma.
The large Chamber of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalogue Minister for Social and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of Sparkasse La Ca, Jaume Lanaspa.
But stressed that Trinijove was called into life in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated, but he adds that the work done to now is "a foundation".
For the Presidents of the Generality, Trinijove is an example that is able to fight difficult circumstances and gives people hope in difficulties.
"The economic crisis is for the unity and the work he provides, nothing new," he explained.
Employed house in which the rice party was made was released
The householders had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at the Balmes Street No. 51 (Barcelona).
The 12 householders left the building last afternoon without opposition.
All indicates that the Alptroms of the Neighbors of House No 51 have found an end on the Balmes Street.
Twelve people left the building which they had illegally occupied yesterday afternoon and organized great festivals that had brought the neighbourhood to delay.
After the space, the door was shut to avoid a similar situation.
"From now, access will be controlled," the administrator of the House.
The householders who had 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, who were residents, took the entire electrical installation and part of the water supply. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the three below stages, large partys were held up to two days and the mieters were spent.
Besides the building, there is a discotheke, a balles 51, which also was burdened.
Her inheritant, Maria Pantinat, explained Europe Press that her business would have returned by 80% from the beginning of the household.
The owner of the discotoke pointed out that the householders made their concurrence unlawful, because they recovered the drinks to three euros while they costed 10 euros in the discotoke.
The owner of the free time site was shown by the neighbors for the rest of the city, while, according to their statement, the warm was not touched by the chairmans of the disc, but by the householders, and especially by the guests of the festivals organized there, which, according to the statement of the harmful neighbors in the last weeks, became more and more.
The responsibility of the Discothek explained that the disappointment was so large that she agreed with the owner of the building to have no need to break up for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (State Police) also assures that she has received more complaints from the neighbors in the last weeks.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular - Volkspartie) in the town Council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested the last week to clear the building immediately and to get the problems of civil society and the destruction of the city quarter in the griff.
He explained that before summer there was only one etage of the building occupied, but that the householders in the past months in all the ears of the building and almost all the apartments had been preserved. In some, it even came to the staff.
In this sense, he adds that "the need for the end of unjustice and to deal with the associated actions in the building."
Yesterday another building in the city quarter of Nou Barris was released by the Catholic police.
At 15.30 p.m., the police approached the street Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects are excluded from the disputes on honourers with the exemption.
The state of the 16th port opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the middle of the 1980s, at the highest point of the Corporation Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its spite on the support of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a great park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With CMB falling in 1987, the park was returned to the top border of Barcelona, because the capital city of Catalonia belongs to the few who are not spread in the north-south direction, but to the top (bound) and below (sea).
Collserolas' instruction plays as a natural park with this idea.
As an example, the Central Park served no longer, but Yellowstone with wild wheat in the role of the yogibar.
As far as the city was issued in September a riesen statement, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access to Collserola.
Absolutely, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Or it's the way, or someone's going to put the gate on the land.
The question is: Collserola, Park or Mount?
The accusation is not only from organisational view, but also in view of a reflection on the city the prehema in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurrent topic that can return to the two members of this old box, which are in the board.
And exactly this fact offers the substance for one of the rare coincidences between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have been involved in the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The accommodation is suitable.
For Roldán "is necessary", after the attack on the coast, talking about the "Front on the Mount", as long as the talk of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been exhausted over the green eggs.
"Man should come out of the Prince that Barcelona's largest park of the beach is.
In addition, because he is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," judges the architect for which the title "Tore of Collserola" provides a "lexical case" in itself: "You can not imagine it as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas on which you need to be treated."
The model, such as Roldán and Bayona with state-building experience, considers that the proposal is a "intellectual challenge", which is "one" in itself.
According to the "uncertainty that brings the form of a public ra" today, according to the experiences of the 1980s that have been in the area of the Forêt.
The first threat is the own limitation to what can be built.
"What to limit is always to fix the next step," i.e. to exceed it.
"You need to think of new urban planning instruments, because the current [appealing to the General Metropolitano Plan (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
The modal, which is more questionable, simplifys that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, can be "comprehensible than a park that is not in Barcelona" and for pure topographic reasons.
The model reminds that there is already a party of Patronat de Collserola that should not "at baptism ears", although it is grateful to the city manager that she has given the possibility to contribute to this project "for the first time to".
He notes that the nearby of the mountain to the city of the Leader Book, which allows the architects to share the debate, although he expresses his "double" if this technical profile is the multidiscriminary teams called in life ("the right", he says), "We architects should be only a tool."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question is complex in the heading of this article, since in the terms of consignment, a global view of Collserola failed: "16 competitions were expressed in the middle," he says, "on the axis of the Mountain Sea. But there is no longer average perspectives that consider the area in the whole of it."
This has at least led to a share in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would colide with the architect of the port.
See opinion, the city should ensure that the streams are so equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length that comes to a small transition between city and green zones.
Casino forge Jonas Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days Schweigen, the complainant of Casino Red freed the brother of the Master of Monterrey from the process that is led against him because of a courageous pressure.
After 72 days of prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the complainant of Casino Red has forgiven him before the second penalty court of the district, which leads the process against the brother of the citizen of Monterrey because of pressure.
After the attent to the Casino Royale published by Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is to see, which forces him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration may approve the secret operation of the law.
After the penalty, the State advocate opened a penalty procedure against the brother of the Panist citizen who was arrested for 30 days on 2 September.
After four hours with the officer of the Ministry of Public 3 and Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
At this place, he remained 49 days after a second arrest order after the officer of the Ministry of Publico had committed the criminals for the destruction and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the prison office of Cadreyta because he had courageously seen the owner of Casino Red with one half million pesos. However, he stayed only a few hours in the Mediterranean Safety Treat, as he suggested murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court procedure as the income of the State prison by San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Court of Justice, Jorge Yánez, was granted to him a detention regulation, which stated that after nearly two months of investigation, there were sufficient evidence to speak for the payment of 1,5 million pesos to the representatives of the House to open this in contrast.
This Monday, Victor Aldo García Gomez asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the citizen's brother, to be punished, so he will be put on free foot in the next hours.
At the time of the judicial hearing, Ramiro Arias, officer of the Ministerial of the Court of Justice, García Gomez asked whether he had suffered the damage and who of the owner of the House had expressed his forgiveness. However, the lawyer kept the name.
According to the case of 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is freely spoken, and there is no consequences against the process and no refund is required.
After hearing the commander of the law at 15.50 p.m., Larrazabal Breton was immediately placed on the free foot.
The Secretary of Justice, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas that he was released and would have put his case into the acts.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Yacome provides details about the flight accident in which the Governing Secretary Francisco Blake and seven other persons died.
The Secretariat de Communications y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results of the accident in which the Governing Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons faced lives indicated that the hubscrewer was prompted directly against the ground with its entire unreversed structure without that the pilot could have introduced a landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Yacome, Secretary for Communication and Transport, said that the pilot would have visited before the start, the terms were appropriate for the flight.
"The story that the propeller flights had contact with trees in 25 metres height, whereas the rubber lost the rubber, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several land contacts."
He also explained that the rubber was built for 19 inhabitants, so he fulfilled all conditions for the transport of the staff.
He said that in the investigations in the area in which the machine was deceived, there were no clusters found.
"In the search, no parts of the aircraft were found in other places, the survey covered the entire structure.
The rubber was built for 19 insates, so he fulfilled all conditions for the person's transport.
The area shows a degree of 7 to 30 degrees.
It is currently priority to get the results as soon as possible, but these several months, perhaps even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Services Auxiliares (Secretariat for Flights and Assistance Services in Mexico), was assured that the Hawkwater of the State Mayor Presidential was fallen on a slow departure of aircraft logs and the aircraft.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the speed."
At a press conference, the leader of the SCT, Pérez Yacome, included six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
View speed:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight in accordance with the rules of the flight, which means that the manship had to have adequate view during the flight and the ground.
Measurement conditions:
The AICM had adequate meditation conditions at the start. The currency of the continuous flight towards the border area between Mexico and Mexico State ≥ some deeply dependent clouds.
Selected speeds:
It is possible that the mastership has chosen a lower area with better view towards the Cuernavaca number.
Update:
The opproll coordinates and the last radar record of the hubshooter are agreed. It may not have been given a loss of control on the aircraft or a difference from the flight.
Expansion of the rest of the flight in a limited area:
The information forwarded to this date indicated that the rubber was spread from direct and side direction.
The pattern of the dispersed aircraft residues allows the hubscrewer to be split up on the ground with his unexpected structure.
No indication on fire or explosion:
The rest of the aircraft offers no fire or explosion at the accidental place.
The latest results of the investigation indicated several earthly contacts.
In the surveys from the place, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet over the sea level. The area is deteriorated and shows a screen of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the hubschrunner probably has been breaking.
Some information indicate that the hazards could have had several land contacts.
Following a minuous search in a area that passed over the locked area at the accidental place, no splitted aircraft parts were found, which strengthened the assumption that the uninterrupted aircraft structure was spread against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to detect the gene for fatality
It leads to a research project to detect the gene for failure in children and youths supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Action of Mexico) announced that there was a research project for discovering the gene of fatigue in children and youths under the title "Genetic of Fatality in Children and Youth" to find the genetic marks in relation to overweight.
Miguel ́z López, leader of the Unidad de Investigation Médica en Bioquímica (Apartment for Medical Research, Biochemie) at the clinic Hospital de Specialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that a prohibitional team, consisting of doctors, hospitalists, energetic specialists and social workers, was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students of post-graded study approach at Instituto Nacional de Salud Public (INSP) and Centro de Investigation y de Studies Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the facilities. Interests can come to the sports places of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and youths are carried out every Sunday from 8.00 p.m.
He stressed that the investigation started on the sports place of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the Federal State of Mexico) and continued since 8 October on the sport place of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the Federal State of Mexico).
When the goal of 500 to 600 researchers is reached, the sports place of Independence (south of the capital population) continues and is completed by Morelos (norther of the capital).
He explained that the goal of the Property is to learn the knowledge of the Property and the role of genetics related to the development of vitality and the Implementation of risk factors of Mexican children and youths to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
In the world’s day of diabetes, he explained that it would be encouraging that three thousand children and youths in the age of six to 14 should comply with the understanding and in view of their parents.
They will also ask questions about their corporate A and their physical disease predicts to control risk factors, diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He further indicated that at the same weekly, the individuals were tested (weight, size, tail range), their blood pressure and blood pressure, such as glucose levels, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and genetic substances (the test of the rationalisation of genes related to the fatty at the age of children).
López stressed that this investigation would eventually be carried out by the health care of the health staff on the alarming weight growth of young people.
"The health issues from 1999 and 2006 showed that in nearly six years the share of fatigue boys increased by 77% and that the girls with weakness increased by 47%. The overweight has also increased dramaticly," stressed the IMSS specialist.
He announced that the search for genetic marks was based because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from the other people.
He announced that a (e) Mexican (in) in the average of 65% of Indian-American, 30% of more and 5% of African descendance, reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetic fatty genetics are pressured in the ability to extinguish the extent of energy taken to us (calories) so that it is recorded in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits for the investigators were in a comprehensive investigation of the children, where they would be able to determine whether they had a degree of overweight or fattyness.
It would even investigate the appearance of dark skin pellets in the naked and inner arm (avanthosis), which indicate the probability of drug exchange and diabetes in the prestadium.
All information would be treated with confidence and reported in writing to the doctors. The doctors declare to the parents all the results of the meat and propose changes in lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
López explained that there are three fundamental ones responsible for overweight, fatty and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, which means missing movement every day, to carry the most time of the day before the television and to use transport, rather than to go to short ways.
The high calories, which means increased consumption of sugar drinks and carbonhydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger, etc.), together with a high fat and egg collection and the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt prevented by UNAM of locking
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Chemical Faculty at the UNAM University, develops moderate asylums with polymers to make the mixture more resistable to meditation conditions and temperatures
If the signs out of the street area were considered not necessary to repair almost 200 000 sticks when the raintime in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de Mexico (State of Mexico valley), Rafael Herrera Najera, researchers at the Chemical Faculty (FQ) at UNAM University, warned and assured that if the exhibition and maintenance of the approximate stock were appropriately reduced significantly or even completely avoided.
In the proposal "Technical clusters", which he held for the International Year to chemically, he said that the laboratory for which he is responsible for developing asphalts with polymers modi , to produce a similar mixture of asfalt, which, however, shows a greater mechanical resistance at high and low temperatures.
Mrera Najera believed that this type of moderate asfalt in areas with extremely heavy climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road area and to avoid the occurrence of shocklockers.
He explained that the asfalt - the most severe part of the earth oil - is a coalwater connection from which a part has a high molecular weight - the aspecies - and the other part a lower - the malena mentioned as this.
The teethical behaviour of the asphalt means that it relates at high temperatures of approximately 180°C as a liquidity, at 120°C he is very deeply fixed and nearly 50°C, while it is used at very low temperatures.
"It means that the resistability of asphalt on the streets is not equal, but changes on one day depending on the conditions and temperatures," the chemical engineer outlined.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible road investment that consists of six materials, including the last three asfalt.
Among the top shields there is a shield of asfalt based on small, in asphalt, and then stumbled stones.
Each individual stone of this shield, be bound in asphalt.
If the vehicles continue to move and generate powers on it, this ship allows a power distribution in the road facility.
"If it were moderate asfalt, the powers would be more distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"About the sleeve," he said, "the last shit will be exposed, called the tragedy, which consists of winning stones, i.e. from sand, which was also built in asphalt.
Since these bottles are in contact with the driving attacks, they need a greater mechanical power than the throat, and they need to make rubber.
The most powers of this road facility are received and distributed, the tragedy also needs a suitable dick and the material of which it consists.
The conditions of meditation, especially humidity and temperature disorders, are further, important to be taken into account, above all things the water," he said, "when it affects significantly the behavior of the dilution.
When the territory is fed, the water is in the shot and only turns hard again. This causes all the shields of the roadband and thus occurrence of shocklocks.
"When a shock comes," he said, "the deck will be removed before the deck, while the deck is first affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be held at the first signs by appropriate guarding programmes."
The member of the National de Investigadores System (National Research System Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of shocklocks. Therefore, the dick of each vessel of the road facility should always be related to the vehicle load and must be ensured that this scheme is complied with to avoid frequencies.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research works were still waiting for, for example, about asfalt emulsions that are even on the market in other countries, and with which the locks were simply restored and without applying high temperatures.
What did the Kandidatin del Valle fail to be the new Miss Ko Papa?
Analysis of those who affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Mrs. Ko.
El Valle receives his 14th mistake.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was empty in the delivery of the Crone for Miss Kouca.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winner podium, putting a silver crown and the band that she showed as a new Miss Koıei.
The result received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the Krone and the ceder, the Department already comes to 14 mistitles and Melina is referring to the Legion of Women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in hands. It belongs to the proclaimed misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), ↓ra Domingguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many face today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite, which showed at every presentation that it was available over all to be the new Miss Ko Papayia. In other words, it was chosen to the Queen of the Police and to the Major Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also received the beauty Queen Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Ko Papalia with home.
The first person, who is determined to make the decision of the Jury to call her first Miss, is that she had not convinced her by Martín Murillo Gomez from the Carreta Literaria Leamos the answer to the question "What Book has most influenced you and why?"
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questionnaire:
"I read much, I believe pretty in literature, I think it's a sort of civilization, let me think that the book that for my childhood the most strongly said, 'The little prince' is a very deeply deep book.
Currently, I read `Sculd and Süne'. It is a book of the universal culture that we should all read. I just read a book of Irene Nemirowski, a Russian, a beautiful book that is called 'slidenschafts'.
A response that was a little contrary, first because of the term `civiliz' and second, because she did not explain exactly how each of her mentioned book had influenced her.
But after the conclusion of the ceremonie, Melina explained to feel quiet and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, what must happen.
And for all people: Please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
In addition, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is burned.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the preferred one who had received all the cases in the home and who had received all prices (Gastronomy competition Oster, public vote on the best hand-skined cost and Reina Mother), "the other candidates had zealously made what the Queen stressed, which couldn't shine on the stage."
And it was observed at their first presentation at the bathroom at the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at their two holidays at the Crown Festival.
Although she was safe in both of them, she lacked the power and the weight that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico saw.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en house" at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned to Miss "shows that the candidate, who wins the most prices during the competition, would not be queen."
○ Valle went to the close of the press out of the way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was not able to convince the jury about their interest in social work, which is the key of national beauty competition.
It will have his reason for two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty, they seek a woman who was involved in the social issues of her country.
"The opportunity is not enough for a Miss Ko Papaie. It is necessary to look over the body and to be able to address the social feeling that she had already participated in the competition in projects before it was engaged in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with its defects of the the Property and the fibrose that they had noticed in the magengengengenge. But that is contrary, because the jury chose her as candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good food habits and responsible physical work.
The tragedy of the Queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, indicates that Melina didn't have the best body that it would be better, "but her problem with the fibrose in the woods, which was not to notice for me honestly, was not to observe her score on the last day."
Currently, the journalist Guido Hoyo, from the Cromos magazine, believed that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the chirurgical attacks she had undergone.
"The operations are all right, but Valle didn't know how she should make it right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place has had to shoot her."
Because of this price, which was the first time forwarded by the National Beauty Contribution, there was a cruel predict that should be true in the night. It was deceived that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort price to not allow her to come to the joy of the crown.
Whatever it is true or not, it is that Melina comes from today, not as a Queen, but as a princess, a position that you offer the possibility of representing the National Beauty Competition of Cookie in one of the international competitions.
However, she will be one of the Queens who, despite her overwhelming attack to Cartagena, have gone the crown into the story.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscope from Cali came into the history when the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officers plays a key role.
Last 4 November, a lophoscope of the State Auditorship (CTI) came from Cali as the man who visited the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Strengths of Cooluinia) by comparing the fingerprints.
From the seven lophoscopistes in the CTI Division, this week Eliazar González had preparation service, a man from Puerto Tejada for 21 years in criminal investigation procedures.
At the beginning of his kare, González in the communities of Chocó, where he often had to go in the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodys he had to identify.
2000 he sent over after Valle and after the end of the necessary course, he specialized himself on lophoscopy, which is the investigation of the skin exhausted, i.e. the hand and foot areas.
In the week of the use against the Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was pointed out to packaging clothing for at least three days.
Something big expected him.
Friday night, he fled in the Palmira's hole to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodys, and that the deceit was that one of the man who had led the old Guerrilla of the world could be identified. Therefore, he should take the ten finger printing sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (a real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, because this compared the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no bart, was like a builder of the area dressed, didn't carry a brilliant and was much darker.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Weapons with a lupe, tinte, a pf cell and a cup lamp compare Eliazar the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen right: it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for the Defence Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to inform that it was actually the leader of the FARC.
In Track Search
For a dactyloscope from Sijjan in Cali, the appreciation that President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González had been assigned at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
People don't know our work.
The dactyloscopy is a precise property without error quota which may be a key factor in the resolution of a criminal.
Lophoscopists are not only identified by body, they are also undergoing investigations in murder and craft cases and see the efficiency of the persons arrested.
When they are arrested, many criminals present false evidence papers or they do not have any.
We're taking their fingerprints and searching them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to throw a piece of wall out of a house at a thief steel, because the deb had opened up exactly at this place with his hand when he dropped out one with a smuck and money fully stopped safe.
"The walls are hard because their surfaces are inappropriate for the deduction of fingerprints. But in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminals who had shared in a number of debtors," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also be discharged or charged by murderers.
Recently, a killer was found surrounded by snapshots.
In the investigation, a family member could be convinced and actually agreed with a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it will be linked to the place where the criminal was committed.
A dactyloscope of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reactions would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a pf cell or a band will be used to be taken.
Afterwards, the prints are sent to the Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the personal staff.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without exhibition papers," explained the CTI expert.
He thought it wasn't all the way it would be shown in the TV series SCI.
Like not all gold that is clear, it isn't all to be a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if you do a corresponding comparison.
The "emports" calls the authorities in New York out
Hundreds of demonstrants joined themselves in cells on the Zuccotti place.
A majority came to the room order and changed his location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement asked the New York authorities on this Tuesday when they tried again with a judicial order to attend the Manhattan place after they were released from the place in the morning greenhouse and attempted to postpone another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrants were forced to join the Zuccotti place where they wanted to make access to a legal order that allowed the "importants" to make the new cells in this place, and a different part of the movement to the room order was held on the side of a park northward in the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the Court doesn't allow us to camp in the place, we meet ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means about the back to Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstration," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray concluded that the response of the "employed" to the spacing of her cell store, directly assigned by Michael Bloomberg, the citizen of New York, until the court came, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the violent space of the place and approved the demostrants.
The "importants" have a new park that is connected to the crossing of the Central Channel Street and the Sixth Avenue in the nearby of the introduction into the Holland tunnel, which is connected to New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least one hour, but afterwards the police met and arrested some of the demonstrants, though Bray could not give exact numbers. He assured the message Agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with handhelds.
The organization assures that it would have found hundreds of people in this place, in which there was also a departure of religious leaders as a sign of their support for members of the movement and the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti place (a land property) remains closed in the expectation of a judicial hearing that is still established for this Tuesday and to analyze the legality of the spacing located in the morning greenhouse.
Some of the demonstrants held by the place took photos of this court office and distributed them. They even gave some of the police who watched the place, as Bray reported, that some of the police would have struck demonstrants.
The Court of Justice prohibits the authorities to release members of Occupy Wall Street from the place and to apply the "Seeds that have been prohibited after the occupation and to prohibit the demonstrants with their cells and other things they have already used to return to the park."
Citizen Bloomberg clears the press that, due to this judicial arrangement, the reopening of the place for public transport and the demonstrants has been re-opened. The demonstrants pointed out that the town laws did not allow them to re-configure the place with cells and sleeps.
The citizen teacher personally defended the room of Zuccotti place in the morning green, at which almost 200 people were arrested, and they were determined because the demonstrators were "dismissed against the right".
Bloomberg explained that he would have given the arrangement for the space space because he had "converted into a place to which the people were not to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to add damage to others," because "several businesses had been threatened" and the residents feared "to their quality of life".
"The spacing in the morning green was simple and shows that Bloomberg is in fact aware of the protection of the financial interests and not of the protection of the interests of North American workers," the speakers of the movement, who charged the citizen "not to respect the press freedom".
The responsibles of Occupy Wall Street informed that they thought to organize "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and associations, to remember the two months that the protests have been held since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV Christmas show the girlfriend Mary
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian famousnesses, it will appear on 1 December in the TV program "It's a日 Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allens assistant in "Home Improvement", salvation swimming in "Baywatch", caninch at "Playboy", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the watchman and model will be at a conference sentence of the Canadian TV.
The private CTV TV channel today said that Anderson and the "crooner" (Balladensanger) Michael Bublé and other Canadian Favorites on 1 December in the television program "It's Peter's Christmas" and a very special girl Mary will have life.
CTV today broadcast pictures of the television program, in which Anderson - which also appears for the spread on the Internet of a self-dressed porno, where she appears together with her former husband, the player of "Möttley Crüe", Tommy Lee, as a virgin Mary with a puppet in the shot that Jesus should present.
In the scene Peters, a Canadan comicer of Indian origin, appears recently as modern at the sending "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, as Jesuskind.
The CTV's Christmas Programme is not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, the end of March in Buenos Aires, married the argentin model Luisana Lopilato, and that is not far away.
Recently, the bublé at one of his concerts in New York had covered the North American Kim Kardashian as "hour".
Japan is born again after the earthquake
The BIP w° 1.5% thanks to the internal consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from the beginning of March
Since the last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, which still was healing after the zeroteric earthquake, which invading atomic crisis, and the worst catastrophe that Japan had learned to be the second World War.
The first deficiencies of the Government in Tokyo evaluated the injury of 300 000, which seems to be deteriorated despite the difficult world economy.
After three quarters, the information on the Brutto-Inland product of July to September served to end this chapter: the BDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the high-repaid quota for the year.
The second quarter value - in Japan starts the business year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
Rebuilding can be explained in part by the machine rebuilding for the rebuilding of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the following Tsunami.
In fact, the enterprises increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for capital facilities decreased from January to March, the first decrease after six months of uncontainable increase.
However, the actual conversion of the Japanese economy is not based on cheensian interventions that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
In particular, Japan was observed thanks to the development of the internal consumption, which currently increases 60% of the Japanese BDP.
This variable increased by 1%, instead of the growing depths for vehicles, travels and free-time jobs.
The Yen Stigma
Tokyo has confidence in the country after the Yen - the Japanese election - in one of the "flight currencies" of investors who have fled before the Eurozone crisis and the tragic prognoses for the U.S.A., a privilege, which is like a grave steel on the export companies' accounts.
With a stronger choice, the products in the foreign land are tenderer, a serious problem for a country which is based on the health of large technology products.
For example, Toyota and Sony returned their weak business results from July to September to the notation of Yen.
As the markets continue to host the peripherated EU countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda remains awake.
"You must take care of the sustainable risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economys, the impact of the inflammations in Thailand and the rapid evaluation of Yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very discouraged.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States would have demonstrated clearer signs for the renewal of economic development in September.
The indicator, which predicts the points of the world economy, lighted that the most economic potential would be the brake.
Because he cut about four decades up to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro zone is even under this average value, which is at 100, after it has reached about eight decades to 99.13 points.
Athens allow doubts to come again
Papadimos says that the spare measures would be prevented, but the conservatives will not be subjected to written agreements.
With the risk premiums of peripher countries and its large incertainty, Greece continues to deceive the labyrinth that results from the great debt crisis.
The impression that the "consense" of the new Greek transitional Government is rather a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of political powers, is slowly expressed by facts.
In the currency of the new Prime Minister, Luke Papadimos, yesterday noted that there were no alternatives to the structure reforms and that the hundred days provided in his appointment may be shortly for its implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, would be able to take the new saving measures and, in the case of his request for new elections to the date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is the implementation of the decisions taken on the Gipfel of 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday to initiate a parliamentary debate, which will be achieved tomorrow with the trust vote for the new government.
A package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary law of officers and new measures against tax interference are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samaritan's communication does not clear the doubt of his view: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge from the EU and the IWF, the organ, which needs the 8000 million, which needs the Athens, and clearly noticed that he would not be able to deal with the acquisition of spare measures.
However, the European Commission, which is still irritated because of the impact of the poker game with Papandreu Referencendum, confirmed yesterday, is not to rush at its request: the economic aid would not be subjected if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties would not sign "a clearly written agreement as soon as possible".
The speaker of the Ministry of Economics, Amadeu Altafaj, said that Troika's inspectors "come back to Athens" to discuss with the new government, "what is the payment of the sixth section" for 8000 million euros, though there is no final date.
The Greek kneel has yet a little feet.
Queen Sofia: "That are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasised the "president" position of Spain on this type of financing
Spain "has reached a dominant position worldwide in the role of smallest funding".
The Queen Sofia of Spain noted yesterday that Spain has developed the second benefit of this means for international cooperation in the last two years, which is based on a "tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of trust in mankind".
The Queen invoked the fifth world gap over the smallest credits in Valladolid yesterday. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be absolutely "necessary" to achieve the thousands of years set by the United States until 2015 and "include the goal of the number of persons living with income from less than one of the day, so under the "poverty limit".
Spain also "continue" in the extension of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is responsible for this task", observed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that the Gipfel continues until Thursday will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as major beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have made a lot of success" and "see many challenges."
It is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for "two basic objectives".
The Queen explained that it would be endeavored that 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services until the end of 2015 and that ≥ million of these budgets will be exceeded the poverty limit.
The concept of smaller credits is returned in Spain and the rest of the world on the way "initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago" which the Queen Sofia considers as "the Act of Justice and Recognition".
The father of this funding instrument described it as a "wonderful idealist who has written to the battle against the poverty" and whose work has known her since 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet the loan strategy in place.
This experience followed a year later the first world pipe in Washington and other meetings at the eleven coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "we can see a continuous development", the Queen, whose commitment to this project, she had introduced her as a "Family Head" in Valladolid and as "Pover Poverty Preacher" yesterday.
The Queen Sofia completed its statement by animating the attendants to participate in the debate and search for solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical command"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "a ethical command" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she emphasized that it was a mistake to acquire development assistance at the time of economic bombs, because it is a "durational commitment".
Jiménez believed that the smallest credits were a "first and rigorous" to destroy poverty" and that the governments of the industrial states now needed to work "more than ever" according to solid criteria, and that they should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to be victim.
For Spain, the smallest credits are one of the most important forms of development aid.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, claimed "the success", "marginalised" people, "the always standing before closed doors" "Openance" and the citizen of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, called the presents in a city that opens "their gate, which is recorded by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to choose EU presidents on the basis of general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, on 14 November in Leipzig for Angela Merkel, Kanzler and president of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not intended in the programme, but it has been implemented in heritage, in particular to allow the activists to allow the government policy for Greek today and possibly Italy to be too lax tomorrow.
The European Commission's Presidency proposed by the Bureau was almost a single vote.
Under 1001 delegates only had voted nine and had the vote.
The several minutes of enduring standing Ovation, which, due to their intervention allowances to Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schüble, have no doubt opened from the three European financial ministers.
The main idea of the cancer is - as the request - the following Slogan: the answer to the crisis is not less, but more Europe.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also "new million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the cancer, "the time has come for a transition in Europe."
This could be expressed by strengthening the control of the European Union of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the countries in the Eurozone; but this could be a view in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote."
However, this is, in any case, one of the proposals taken by the Congress, which were clearly Wolfgang Schuble Pate.
It is probably only little likely that the 47 are quick to this revolution to some: Grob British is the thing rejecting, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milen steel is placed.
Similarly, the delegates in a great majority have rejected the proposal for the weight of each country in the ECB representation in accordance with the weight of each economy, which was obviously a strengthening of the position of Germany.
As a result, the conceitor covered the climate within her party has strengthened the reference points to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win its congress on the costs of the "small" or the countries in difficulties that would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As the European request for the importance of the "German-France Friendship" refers to a paragraph, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not direct.
Because this reminds that Leipzig was in the middle of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
One of the most humiliating disasters of the Napoleon armies.
What is the damage of disease notifications?
Following family aid, UMP and Government are now attacking the reports of disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be met on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a family aid box and to present a talk about the - since 2007 - the subject of the fight against social distress and the economic dependence of the State.
In order to accompany this attack, which comes from the effort to submit the economy in a harvest sample, but on the other hand, not less than the offers of a axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority will be able to report workers' diseases.
In addition to budgetary objectives: the Government refers to the introduction of a fourth karenty day before taking into account a disease notice in employees in the sector.
In good Germany, this means that a sick employer without authorisation of the specific company would lose the payment for four days, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A decree that, according to the Daily Journal "Les Echos" threatened to wrath, would, however, help to introduce 280 million euros.
And the more symbolic characteristics of another decree were: to purchase the State officer a unforgetted carence day in the case of illness (in contrast to the three carence days in the sector, there is no carence period for them).
When these questions are in the debate, the majority simplifies the deterioration, and this time goes to the misuse related to worklessness.
"The controls will be essentially more important, and they will be forgotten, if required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November before the sender's microphone RTL.
Like in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of distortions in the areas of disease notifications seem to be a little unproportionate.
This has actually been an object of permanent observation since 2002 and political openness that have been most commonly produced.
The French are no longer more frequently sick than people in Europe.
However, let us refer to the country-wide numbers.
According to the CNAM National Hospital Case, more than 237 million euros were paid in 2006.
The construction of the Economic Research and Documentation Institute for Health Research and Documentation in 2008 represented 11,3 billion euro 5% of the health expenditure.
Under this amount, 46% were fallen in the case of maternal vacation and employment accidents and 54% in the case of illness authorisations, which include 6,2 billion euros.
And then 2,5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, Frances were allowed for the 17,8 days in 2009, according to an Alma Consulting Group, averagely only 14,5 hospital days.
A average value that reflected certain differences: another, in 2007 by Monster.com, the Kar Planning website, showed that 75% of the 40.000 employees asked to have taken no single hospital day.
Another of the disease insurance reports shows that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were less than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11%.
In comparison with their neighbors, the French employees are thus not more than working in other places.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the French, State Centre for Economy Research (CNRS) showed that the global absent rates (based on illness or otherwise) were obscilled between 1994 and 2001, while in France between 10 and 11% were 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The disturbance of disease notifications is a low part of black work.
With regard to the fraud, there is only a weak extent.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 results in systematic controls in disease notifications exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public high school for education and training of technicians and engineers) under 1.5 million controls found that 13% of the 285.000 realised, short-term disease notifications, which are in 37.050 cases, were justified or too long.
In systematicly controlled disease reports of more than 45 days, there were less than 1.2 million 11% in "unjustified or unjustified" cases, which were 132.000.
Thus, in total, this makes 169 000 unjustified cases of a number of million employees who have made a ill notice.
A number that represents only a weak extent to those of the black work.
According to UMP Deputy Dominique Tian, the reporter of a business report in July, this is between 9 and 15 billion euros per year, which is more than the total rate of daily discharges, which is essentially more than the defraudation in Latvia.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needed a new adjustment programme to reduce its economy.
On Monday, on 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced before Parliament, added to the fact that his Government had approved a hundred days from the Union to carry out this task.
"To continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support of our partners and a new budget adapting programme," said the Governing Boss in his first public talk in the debate on the trust vote of Parliament on midweek.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the Eurogipse meeting on 27 October is the "major task" of the new Government, since the impact of the country within the Eurozone on the game, as it should be added.
Accordingly, Mr. Papademos planned to decrease the State deity of the country about 9% of the Bruto-Inland product from today to the end of the year after this was 10.6% in 2010 and in 2009 at 15.7%.
The rights refuse the new spam exceptions
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right wheel, had agreed on Monday to the already approved exhibitions in relation to an attempt from the debt crisis, but had provided that his party would not be prepared for an additional breakdown.
"We will not vote in favour of new detentions," he said in the event of a assembly of members of his Partie New Democracy.
He was ready to explain with the conditions of reduction of budget debts and debts, as well as the fight against deficiency, but it was an enemy to all who would undermine the economic extent.
The EU Commissioner, who had prevented IWF and the EU from providing the necessary loan for more than 8 billion euros without a written guarantee of all parties with the support of the planned payments, had responded to Antonio Samaras that his word would be sufficient and that he would not be under pressure of ovens.
Euthanisation and joint death must be legalized as a expert body
The Canadians live in a refusal of death, as a report from the Queen Society of Canada
The Board explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors together in relation to painful treatment to prepare the best painful resources, and that is also beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian Society is in a refusal against death.
Only 9% of the Canadians are actually able to talk to their army about conditions under which they want to die and take provisions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Queen Society of Canada, in which six experts were associated in different areas, including ethics, rights and medicals.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the penalty law in order to allow accompanied suicide and euthnasia to make such a decision in patients who are able to be considered to take such a decision.
As a record, experts quote a recently published investigation of the independent EIU company, which compared the death quality in 40 countries of the earthball.
Although Canada has been located on the 10th round, it notes that "the Medical Death Monitoring in Canada has produced a culture in which people have been able to cut the topic of death".
Medical maintenance or not: 77% of the Canadians have no access to painful resources, so the experts of the Queen Society of Canada report us.
And despite the majority of the Canadians' desire to die at home, 68.6% of them die at the hospital.
From the whole country, the rate of 86% of deaths in the hospital in Quebec is considered at the maximum.
In the heavy question regarding Euthanase and accompanied suicide, the rapporteur is addressed to conclusions that the position of the Federal Government, which has already committed, does not want to make any amendments to the penalty law on Euthanase and accompanied suicide.
But now, according to the experts who have equivalently inspected all those countries who have legalized or decriminalized the approach of Euthanase and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would lead to misuse in their application, thus the practice of euthanase or accompanied suicide of incompetenced persons or not voluntary.
In contrast, there are more cases of such crimes just in the countries where euthanase and associated suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie visited in a telecommunication in the report yesterday.
"Euthanisation is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"And the companion of Switzerland is practiced in Canada, despite that it is clearly illegal here," Jocelyn Downie said.
Canadians for the Euthnasia
We compare us to that, according to an issue of Reid Reid in 2010, 85% of the Canadians have already been evacuated in favor of Euthnasia, since they believe that they have made it possible for people at the end of their lifetime to increase their suffering.
And 66% believe that the content of a legalisation of Euthnasia does not result in giving the message that life of older or prevented people is less valuable.
As regards those who have already exercised a suicide, the questionnaires are 41% the opinion that they should not be persecuted criminally.
As regards the maintenance or position of the resources in patients, the situation is less clear as the reporter.
Similarly, they draw close to their Recommendation List that the penalty law should specify that the suspension of the funds for which a legal deduction has been proposed should not apply as criminal.
Furthermore, the Expert Board calls for the training of health experts in the task to respect a delay of the funds at the end of life, and this must be feared without criminal persecution.
The Board explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors together in relation to painful treatment to prepare the best painful resources, and that is also beyond cancer cases.
In addition, the committee requests to take them at least because they have been reduced by physical pains and affected by the same procedures as the Euthnasia.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health have already submitted preservations in respect of the conclusions of the report of the Country Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the health law, has dealt with the attitude of the reporting experts, among otherwise as "extreme" because they have no limits to the euthnasis practice in patients in the final phase.
"This opens the ports for a situation in which everyone who is living and older than 18 years is to ask another person to be helped by himself," says RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also points out that the rapporteur seemed to have the own responsibility of the individual over all other values shared in the social work of the society.
But now, he says, there are "Line guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist for health law, has also made a strong opposite to the conclusions of the report, which it titled "Pro-Euthanase-Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is even a member of the Queen Society of Canada, doubts, particularly the reports on the non-previous use of misuse in certain countries where Euthanase and Suicide are legalised, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls President Assad for the power to come
Ën "Complott" is locked on
It is apparently isolated
The parties of Baschar al-Assads have demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Auven Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on the Baschar al-Assads, which, however, is supported by the Russian support and points out a "Complott" against the country, has been strengthened yesterday.
Two days before the exhaustion of the Arab Liga, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against the cousin, although Turkey and Jordan, the Neighbourhood countries, have been able to have a derogation from President Assad.
King Abdullah II. From Jordan was yesterday the official Arab Prime Minister, which president Baschar al-Assad had invited to defeat his authority, in which the fourteen civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country in the heart, he would have fallen, but he should also create the conditions necessary for a new era of the political Syrian life," says the King of Jordan, Neighbourhood, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomatic leader Ahmet Davutoglu, on his own, complained that from the beginning of the year to the Syrian regime, Turkish mediation trials had not been successful.
"They in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and are not able to satisfy this must go," he explained in an example to the neighborland to which Turkey adopts a continually closer attitude.
The United States have, on their own, confirmed the "decrease of the consensus against Assad and the powers of the Syrian regime" according to the decisions of the Arab Liga and of the European Union.
"The International Community, the United States, the EU, the Arab Liga and the countries such as Turkey have increasingly increasing sounds in view of the repressions," observes Mark Toner, a speaker of the State Department.
At the same time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the Government of Dar'a in the Southern region died, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH announced.
Two other citizens, according to this NGO, were killed by "shoot changes and severe bomb attacks on Jobar" in the hosted town of Homs.
A press conference, however, was the Syrian Aven Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim's view of the country's taxes to the end of the crisis.
Furthermore, he has reacted with emphasis on the decision of the Arab Liga, to suspend his tasks, which represents his appreciation after a "fair step".
"do not be ignored," he added, "the complexs that would fail against prevented."
After the suspension decision, the Arab Liga now examines a "shoot mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Aven Trade Minister Alain Juppé also expressed himself in favour of UN observators' release to civils before the Requies' repression that he was captured in his "Paranoia" to stand on the side.
A high-planed new assembly of the Liga is intended in the Rabat for morning to examine the implementation of the crisis outcome plan on 2 November, and in particular the inconsistent and prospectual displacement of military troops from the hosted cities and the freedom of captured demonstrants.
The Russian Auven Minister Sergej Lawrow considered the decision of the Arab Liga yesterday as "incorrect" to avoid the prevention of possible sanctions against cuss, although China has already encouraged the implementation of the crisis growth plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets for patience and Italy for sacrifice preparation on
Mario Monti, the future Italian Governing Boss, has requested the markets a little more time to form his staff and to implement a program to send "offers" to recover the lost credit value lost during the last months of the Government of Berlusconi.
The former Commissioner of the EU has held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before the present meeting of associations and workshops.
It was his task to invite a cabinet into Parliament, which is relatively strict from external technologies.
"Monti has spoken of a major programme with a series of victims," so Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups in the discussions after he was met with the official president of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, president of the Chamber, had expected to wait on his side that Mario Monti would put a trust vote to Parliament until Friday to ensure that the new government was adequately supported.
The deficiencies will be identified in the presentation of a list of strike, which will, of course, be assigned from a dozen of ministers to the head of Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that the severe nervousness of the Bursen and Obligation Markets requested their time.
In "a democracy there are certain terms", to prepare a government and a government programme, he emphasised that "the markets will be sustainable and comprehensive."
His order by the president was confirmed by the markets, but the injustice was re-enhanced, especially after an unexpected reduction in the euro zone in September.
The official Prime Minister was intended to establish a staff from primary technologies, although he had emphasized that it would like to also join "politicals".
The new Government should only be the date of the next parliamentary election until 2013.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber, the new government should receive the trust evidence of Parliament until Friday.
Mr Monti has been committed to work in the meaning of the goal to make Italy "new protagonists" in Europe since he has taken his function.
A speaker of Commissioner O° Rehn of the EU stressed that "not change our diagnosis against the Italian economy itself in the light of the new government".
The EU, who is convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal for the budget balance in 2013 despite the spar plans taken in these last months, has requested new hardware derogations.
Emma Marcegaglia"Chefin of the Chiefs of Italy, which will be met on Monti on Sunday, is also on the need of the economic accuracy" because a country that has no growth to be expected to respect the animal characteristics."
Mr. Monti, who is for his competence and his independence as Commissioner of the EU (1994-2004), is a "epochen change" of Italy after 17 years "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "requirement of confidence" and "another Italy", so the guidelines.
The Great Knowledge is the long life of his stab.
President Napolitano would like to prevent the choices, since Italy has reached 200 billion state obligations from April to April 2012.
Russian partners help the Iranian Nuclear Energy Programme
A Russian Wjatcheslaw Danilenko has helped the Iran to develop a spring capsule that is used with a nuclear weapons, such as a specialized atmosphere of the NGO on Monday.
The Institute for Economy and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Atom Security Agency AIEA and other documents issued by this UN Agency for the investigation of this Community.
The AIEA has informed the last week its "instantious orgasm" for the purpose of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the introduction of the AIEA documents since ISIS, Danilenko, which was born in 1934, was evident since the beginning of the 60s over three years in a Soviet military nuclear space in Cheljabinsk (Ural) and was shared in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to establish a company in Kiew that produces "Nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine in 1995.
Before he returned to Russia, he then contributed to a Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA's strong evidence that the Iranian development of a nuclear breeding system was supported by the work of a foreign expert, not only in this technology, but also as a Member of the Agency informed, his entire potential kare on this technology was directly conducted in the military nuclear energy programme of its country's origin."
Anti-islamic crimes and crimes increased by 50%
The crimes and delegates against Muslim have been 50% from 2009 to 2010, however, other racial or religious motivated violence crimes have been easily returned or have only increased.
According to these data, the total number of violence crimes committed against Muslims was from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, so 49 per cent, while a 13% increase of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease against Jewish criminals and a global increase of 14% to anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number "hasmotived crime" is in a very weak mave of 6.628 cases, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, as the FBI.
"After a deterioration in 2009, it is difficult to see these crimes and crimes again grow," stressed the Human Rights Organization First.The growth of anti-Islamic violences is particularly significant," so the organization added in a communicative.
"Human Rights First had a long time about the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hatred crimes, should be considered to be severe lawlessness against human rights," Paul Legendre, a responsible of the organization.
"The Government can and should do more in order to combat these disasters," he added to appreciate that this could be done by improving the police's attitude towards the "hazard crime".
The "hazard crime" is an inheritance from the time of fighting for civil rights in the Ananias' federal law.
This legislation was forbidden after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish violents who are addressed against race, skin color, religion or descendance and are now associated with criminal offences of sexual association.
Twitter walks the platform and always likes more Facebook
The Micrologging website Twitter has introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday to enable their users to watch the A’s of those who follow their entries, which allows the service to compare more to Facebook.
The new tab "A" and another "Name" allows better reading live follow-up of the A's "Twitterer", the Internet user, whose messages ("Tweets") are followed and followed by your messages.
This allows us to find out whether they are willing to follow their messages, whether they subscribe to new contributions, favorize certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before his general Internet spread on Monday'in August in a low prosecution of users', the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner offered before the French Presse Agency AFP.
Twitter was for his little instinct functioning, visited with something isthernly admired wordlaut (RT to the reference repeat of the contributions of another person). follow Friday for recommending to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiations, thus opening a public more large with a manage more comparable a the network of the large public Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users discussed with certain "Tweets" on the Internet about this innovation.
"It's unusual, intriguable and equal to very Facebook," writes @imb123.
The "Function"A" will help me to better follow certain elements of my flux-twitters, "releasing @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Registration of a "Gold Budget Rule" into the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Coalition in Austria decided on Saturday to become a "Golden budget rule" in the Constitution to reduce public deficits and to avoid possible degradation from rating agencies in Austria's top bonity (AAA).
It was the social democratic cancer Werner Faymann, who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Ministerial Council, although the public State debt of Austria was 74.6%, so that the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty was 60%, but clearly under the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's payability doesn't decrease the AAA to AA+, we have to pay three billion euro rates each year," Michael Spindelegger, Vize-Canzler and Christian Democratic Auven Minister argued.
Austria also provides a request for the Brussels Gipfel Meeting of the Eurozone Member States of 26 October: the State and Government heads would at the same time have requested the reduction of public defense until the end of 2012 and a return to public account balance in the Constitution or by the adoption of a equal law.
This is the same as the "German Model", since Germany was the first country that had taken such "regulation" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget depth should be decreased by 0.75% of the Brutto-Inland product (BIP) each year, since 2017 the structural depth of the Federal State should not exceed 0.35% of the BDP, however, the regional countries should show balanced budgets as well as the commons.
The objective is to deduct the budget debts under the 60% criteria laid down by the Maastricht Agreement in Horizon 2020/21.
Starker Yen
Noda threatenes with a new intervention on the markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Saturday that the Japanese officer would again intervene on the wheel market if the Yen should continue to grow.
"If we have an excessive volatility" in the Yen exchange course, we will intervene as we have done last time," Mr. Noda said in the Senate.
On Wednesday, Yen was resumed near the historical level that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo massiv Yen has been able to decrease the Japanese devisen value, which is to control a new record value since 1945 against the.
However, the Yen is regularly focused on it, baptized by purchases of investors who view Yen as "refuge valuation" in these insecure times of world economy and debt crisis in Europe.
It was fallen on Wednesday under 77 Yen, the euro was drawn near the symbolic late of 105 Yen to the level that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 Financial Crisis, the Commission noted about 120 Yen, the euro more than 160 Yen.
This electricity fire of the Japanese Devise harms the exports of the archipel because it deducts the costs of the "Made in Japan" product and reduces the income value of Japanese companies from the foreign, since they change them into the countrywalk.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and Tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (Nordosten), for his rebuilding," Mr. Noda, who fears that this hunger of Yen can kill the weak rise already in kiime.
In comparison with the previous quarter for the first time this year, the growth of the economic welfare has increased -1.5% thanks to the exhaustive export increases and the consumption of the "plombed" households again.
The Prime Minister, however, appreciates that Yen's sharing does not reflect Japan's economic funds.
The Minister for Finance Jun Azumi, on its side, invited the Bank of Japan (BoJ), who opened a second-day meeting of its voluntary policy committee on Saturday, to take all the earthly initiatives to enhance the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, a representative of the Institute, has noticed that BoJ has already started "conveniences", which makes it possible to read that the middle of the week has not been expected to be a successful lock.
At the latest meeting on the end of October, the note bank had increased its State obligations purchases by 5.000 billion Yen (47 billion euros) to increase the 55.000 billion Yen (519 billion euros) covering amounts used for various sales of financial tickets to overcome the liquidity.
Eurozone:
Rate feet fast in the height, bears turn back
The risk of the debt crisis is inconsistent with the recognition numbers.
Despite the employment of the new Government heads in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth payments in France and Germany continue to increase the Council of the slaughter countries.
The bourses, still concerned about the stability of the euro zone, also operated on Tuesday, on 15 November, a little more in negative floods.
In Paris, the CAC lost at 10 a.m. 1,4% and fell on 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt returned by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Furthermore, on the basis of new spendings in relation to the refunds of the state loans in which the euro zone is in difficulties, the world markets continue to expose a part of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and are too well conscious of the risk of attainment," said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG markets, quoted by the Presse Agency Re©s.
The bourses in Tokyo, which, on their side, have been locked with a base of 0.7% on the renewed fear of the market shareholders in Europe for the capacity of the debt crisis in Europe.
"Japan has also directed his eyes to Europe as the world, and the trade is moved to a limited variation corridor, while investors have no evidence that the situation has been stabilised," appreciates the Mitsushy Akino, the fund manager of Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewal of the concern of the future of the Eurozone will damage the unit currency that continues its base on Tuesday.
The euro has moved to the lowest level for a half months.
For 10 hours a currency of $1.3570 was valued, so it deserved 0.4%.
According to the broadcasts, it has come back after the CDU, part of the Kanzler Angela Merkel, who had gathered himself in the Congress on Monday, had placed a request that, in particular, provides the possibility of countries in difficulties to get out of the euro zone without abandoning the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish Councils are largely under the 6% limits.
The loans of Italy and Spain continue to be at a very difficult level.
This Wednesday tomorrow, the rental of the Italian Oblig’s 10-years reached 6.85%, one of the Spanish titles to 6.2%.
These spendings of interest rates in Southern countries, but also in France, continue to draw close to the threats of investors.
The future Italian Governing Boss Mario Monti requested more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by debt charge in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, on his side, had approved the implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October of the Eurozone to be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is located in the market visair, since the parliamentary elections in the country were located on Sunday.
The rate ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year-old community has reached a new, historical higher.
In the expectation of Eurozone's growth
Statistically seen, France booked an economic growth of 0.4% in the quarter, so a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the statistical Federal Board INSEE has revised the base of the numbers of the second quarter, but with a minimum of 0.1% of the Bruto-Inland product (BIP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that makes the economic experts most difficult.
Germany had to decrease a growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first highlight of the entire euro zone is expected at 11 a.m., while the EU Commission warns about the risk of renewable recession.
Energy policy:
Dogms should be won
If there is a subject that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity affect the purchase power and competitiveness of companies directly.
It is reasonable to take a choice to take access to this subject and to think about the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be fruitful if it is aware of the total economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, the demographic evolution has a duplication of the electricity request until 2050, a large part of the world's population should not delay a vital element.
At the same time, the depreciation of fossil resources must be decreased to continue to produce electricity without the forced need for reducing emissions of gases, a topic disappeared from the environmental debate, to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany was continued to be isolated in its decision to deny nuclear power.
This is not the case in which it decides to find a replacementable source or in Switzerland, which is intended to build only nuclear powers in the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to be called only some countries, they continue to follow their projects with disappointment.
The United States, on their side, decided to join their park by re-employing the work of Three Mile Island after the atomic accident.
Even if the German model is sometimes set as an example on renewable energy sources, the reality corresponds to the talk.
The election in Berlin will be reduced in the form of a defense of the electricity price, an energetic dependence increased by the increased reduction in import gas, in particular from Russia, to increase CO2 emissions caused by gas and carbon plants.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will be observed in few months.
The case of Denmark gives opportunity to think.
Denmark is one of the most powerful users of coal and gas, used in exchange with wind energy; its CO2 outputs and its electricity prices are 65% and 50% each other than the corresponding average value.
Thanks to the constantness of our energy policy, our neighbors have covered a 40% electricity contrary to our French budget.
Since the energy price in the globalized economy is a key role of competitiveness and a stability role of the industry on national ground, the French companies have a benefit due to the most beneficial electricity in Europe.
Each significant reduction on the atmosphere would therefore follow a strong growth of the energy price, which would be read by the enormous statements on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defense of purchasing power to illusion.
The investigation showed that it was a price that the major majority of French would be ready to decrease as far as it could demonstrate resistance to the principle of this energy source.
We are compared to that the energy policy of our country has enabled it to build a industrial sector with 125.00 direct and 41.000 induced jobs.
As a result of its strong export character, it brings a number of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creaters of numerous jobs.
If France takes the decision to increase from the nuclear power, a majority of these SMEs would be victim, and the annual 6 billion euros in investment and nuclear energy exports would be more and more.
Which electricity would be able to carry out a sixty-year EPR if the decline of its product was pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetical equation, it is necessary to conclude that there is a little like a devil work a wonderful means to produce electricity.
The solutions of CO2 poor solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy result from the complementarity of energy sources.
The highest possible safety level is a absolute impressive for the nuclear power.
In France, we have conducted a security stakeholder, which is uncompromissible and transparent controls in existing works, such as building in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name due to their professionality, are just to be occupied by the security proposal.
In the midst of 50 years, the nuclear industry has developed three serious accidents.
Only one, and even on Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions; so he has suffered without consequences for humans and environment.
In Tschernobyl, the drama was rebuild by reacting and inappropriate human consequences.
In Fukushima, some seem to be forgotten that the accident of two natural disasters has never occurred that caused the death of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will remove its teachings from this accident as it had done after the two previous.
As the fruits of this procedure and a cooperation of the security partners of the French and German operators and nuclear power plants, the EPR provides a design that allows him to resist such phenomenon.
Since the electrical technicians are considered likely to build a nuclear power plant, a building up in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading them free travel to travel to the leading position in the incredible nuclear development.
It is inappropriate and legitimate to seek the best energy building for our country, but it would be unresponsibilityless to allow emotions, doctrines and party employers to dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is Immigration Load or Chance for the Economy?
The immigration policy conducted by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to one of the numbers, agreed by this person with the status of a "Land of Human Rights", as France himself said.
Recently, the disappointment against foreign students from the questionary side has made the weekly views that the Ministry of Internal Affairs had noticed that France had not needed any talents, maurer or Kellner from the foreign.
But this was only rarely analysed by the economic point of view.
On this subject, there is a broad consensus between rights and left.
On the right hand, the sound of Jacques Chirac, which said in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrated workers, could not be a problem for a country," on the left side by Michael Rocard, who had shown 1990, could not take the whole world's poverty."
A single subsection consists in the gray of gross movement
Before the invasion of the national ground by the hairs of Poland Clempners, it was divided from right and left in 2005.
Both stocks have taken the immigrants as a burden for the economic and French society.
The only subdivision is in the degree of grossness that is intended to be involved with the immigrants.
Francois Holland is limited in the programme to banalities that indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "immigration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections, but it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron provide us in a recently appearing work that summarizes the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shape Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton & Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of the immigration flow on economic growth, sales and workplaces in the immigrant countries.
Increasing immigration would strengthen growth and damage the job situation.
The threats to the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that those threaten to substitute the domestic workers, especially the less qualified, by exercising pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that the immigrants in truth are essentially more complimentary than the domestic salaries, since they exercise hardly professionals in sectors that are unemployed.
The small-qualified immigrants work in sectors that travel at home loan workers, who work more qualitatively among immigrants in dynamic sectors in which training is not comparable to the job offer.
Positive Loan Effect
Like a Chirurg would have difficulty to work in a country in which a lack of anesthetists has, this complementarity also affects the positive effect of immigration train on wages and national work situation.
Giovanni Peri in this way calculated that a 1% increase in the immigrant flood would lead to a concomitant, long-term increase in the real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And these, without prejudice to the fact that the case of immigrants imported by idea creation and economic growth is beneficial (heavy proportion of immigrants under Nobel prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute netly to the social systems, in the countries in the midst of around 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Working Organization estimates that a person who is immigrant to Germany in the age of 30 years brings the public budget in the average of its lifetime a net contribution (income minus debts) from about EUR 150,000.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to access his mandate to the missing interruptions "with the teeth".
However, these stated teeth that should be scared by the immigrants have achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has found the democracy, and now remains thinking about the democracy.
Democracy is a valuable good, also a sensitive good.
The continent should be able to remember himself who, after his experience in Athen over two thousand years ago, has made the tragedies of the first world war, the totality of the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Frances in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Greece's chief.
Some believed that it was worth to exercise the vote right, and in the best way they could see the democracy forever over their enemies.
You know since Napoleon's little," that it was a characteristic of the spirit.
The general election right, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is inadequate for this and can be good to "expressive instrument" as the Republican philosophy Etienne Vacherot at that time.
No, the democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, a organization, training and control of the forces, training, advertising, economic and social Community spirit, a legal declaration.
The crisis in Europe in which we are is a economic crisis, but it is a very much and more democracy crisis.
The change of the Greek Truth-Falch Reference would have had in this regard double-included characters: once the need for a powerful return, but on the other hand also those of the disappointing feeling of their impossibleity, their inappropriacy.
This ambitiousness should be considered as overcome.
The truth is that the frontlines of the Democratic Battle have been deployed today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are not going to the right direction.
We have nothing to win to force the success of the national referendum, which has been organized, depending on the needs and in the wrong order.
A vacation for the solemn ruler or a spring with the eyes connected to the empty nationalist backtrace: a gross choice for the citizens!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, full of right, clear and permanent, a choice and democracy, this time at a level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - there is no more knowledge of where to end the number - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It's a whole Europe that uses the dictator of markets and rating agencies, which suffers under its incapacity and insufficient solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humbled at international level.
It is difficult for the transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - there is a whole Europe that is too losing its sovereignty, and so that everyone of the N's associated with it.
The difficulty is to return the leadership of the project to the national sovereignty.
Because it is generally able to reduce the burden of the Europeans' debts, free from the markets, and to apply a future through investment.
The outcome from the crisis has decisions at a level that cannot be liked without a total democracy law without bringing us to ruin.
After this proposal has been struck by Jacques Delors and the socialists for a long time, everyone today is forced to do this.
Consensus.
But this would be imagined without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to the citizens - would be a renewable torture and another sack gas.
We must take a new stage building on us.
To leave the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create" the fact of the Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not have been sufficient here.
This teaching remains valid.
We must build a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a political view of democratic Europe, a real people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become for general goods
The World Measure for Chip Carts opens their gates on Tuesday in Villpentine near Paris in optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an increase of 11% worldwide sales of microprocessorchips (EC cards, SIM card phones) with more than 6 billion units.
The most tragic segment is the uncontact technology that allows payments in public resources or purchasing purchases by simply holding the map on a reading device.
Over the 320 million of the previous year, 460 million uncontakt chip cards should be rebuilt worldwide!
The market share should continue in 2012 (580 million expected units) and more than 10% of the global chip card (6.925 million cards).
Europe wins uncontact payment on grounds after a long time in the Asian Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been spread.
However, consumer markets make damps.
Therefore, Carrefour has issued 2.5 million uncontakt Pass MasterCards this year.
To overcome too fast speed, it is now necessary that the banks recover their customers with these cards.
"Two gross French financial institutions have committed themselves to deal with their customers systematic bankcards in the future with uncontact chip," Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test Payment per phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the future payment means: the mobile phone.
A losing low prosecution of devices has been equipped with the NFC technology necessary to implement these transactions (Near Field Communication).
"They're in motion."
"But at least the next year, they should learn a real development of survival."
"We count in 2012 with the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," says Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiatives.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test course in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employers are to be equipped with a capsule allowing uncontact payment.
The BPCE was a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société General had said yesterday to prepare the marketing instruction of a offer that allows their customers to pay uncontactly by phone.
Terrorist front understands, from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is weak about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Sect Boko Haram.
The relationships of the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Sect Boko Haram seem to be seen.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vize-Auven Minister Mesahel himself assured that Algier had now reached "science".
"The way to do both organizations and the relationships of secret services indicated to a clear cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigations on the outcome of two French in Nigeria in the last January have promoted the interfaces on the day.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Del's responsibilities in Niamey must have been killed at the next day at the same time as several of their deputers on the basis of one operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian researchers wanted to find several phone chips in the dreams at the place of use, belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of telephone calls leads to several speaking partners stationed in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interview partners: a number leads to a Nigerian who has long been in Maiduguri, a city in the north Nigeria, who has stopped the wave of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man that is applied as the Aqmi and the Sect.
"This is a progress, but there is no doubt to wait for clearer statements before you can talk about a operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It's still thoughtful."
"I know that the sect has been aware of financial and intellectual support for auvens since years and that it is still active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo declines.
In these last months, these "sub-effective services" have become more evident in their history, as well as the anaes and the operational modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the use of always more complex spring materials, which are the same manuscript as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community has since this time exercised pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have actually considered the grouping for a long time as the Community of illuminates, which must not be given special attention.
Quick Success
The Boko Haram based in a moschee, a school, and the fundamentalist faith of Mohammed Yusuf in Mayduguri in 2002 - which means in Haoussa so much as "the west education is a shame" - follows the creation of a islamic emirate in the north of the Muslim Nigeria.
In this middle-in-region, the combination is quickly successful.
It policies and encourages strike compliance with the Scharia, while its associated activists are in the fight against the godly central government.
The activists have churches, bars and authorities in the visa.
2009, the activists of Boko Haram showed themselves particularly active with their strengthened attacks against the Commissionary.
However, the reaction from Abuja is as usually ignored.
The army surrounds the city, a number of 800 dead.
The prisoner Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
Thus, the sect is seemingly radical and leaves its highbourgs in the north.
Last Christmas she attended an attent in Jos, which requested 80 people lives, so to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned to the responsibility of a self-mortal representative that occurred in the safe police quarter in Abuja - the first of his kind.
In August, the local seat of the United States N° was conducted to the priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will lead from Mauritania over Nigeria to Somalia, has been difficulted since all safety experts.
Since the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the operating Somalier of Al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé has warned with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria before Boko Harem, and has shown himself ready, "inform all the instructions."
The World of the Republican Presidential Candidates
Middle Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are rivalising in Simpli creation and knowledge about China, Iraq, as well as the assistance for Israel.
Can a cross-border America be a complex world with simplicity to not say: a variety of ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates, the electors could almost have this impression.
Since a few days, the Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and its complainants have made their giving statements and their statements relating to the avenue policy, a traditional Republican point, repeatedly.
Over China, Iran and Israel's help - often in no way - Slogans.
With regard to the nomination of the "Green Old Party" at the highest level in the midst of Romeney, the Chinese were threatened to quote before the WTO and to consider them the "Wheemanipulation" - leading the subject in a America that by immigration of all industrial tours to Asia is the most important.
It was stupid if this would involve the initiation of a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, an ancient messenger in China under Obama and the only candidate, who seemed to have an exhausted vision of Auven policy, has almost cut off the air about his emotions.
He had called to a hand-fast, but attempt to interview with Peking (as well as the current position of Obamas).
But Huntsman will not be answered because he stands in the depths of the opinions.
Reagan's image
Romney had also committed military struggle against Iran, if the sanctions were to break the nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'll order Iran content," he said.
"If Obama is reselected, they'll get the bomb."
Moreover, he proclaimed the strengthened military assistance of Israel and accused Obama to remain responsibility to this partner.
The undertaking Herman Cain, the second placed candidate, has a disturbing knowledge of acts.
Recently, he called to give the Chinese military threat to Contra, since Peking's trying to develop a nuclear power" - and it seemed to make the fact sure that China has been in possession of atomic weapons since 1964!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, is willing to be ready to take the military armies in Mexico against cards.
Obama's rejected receptions against mutual terrorists were also subjected by Cain, Perry and the Michele Bachmann's candidate.
You are far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an auvenpolitical weight.
The current presidential contractors, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all, won the cold war.
They call in memory that Obama also was an amateur and had to give water in his wine what happened to the theme anti-terror.
They are right to the misfortune of his naive conversation with the Iran, his "Jungemen" prejudice from Iraq, his uncleanness in Libya, which also introduced him the call of the weakness.
However, this enemy is not so unforeseen.
The population is more appreciated by the positive national security by the Obama that has disabled Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been protected from military interventions that lead to praise.
And Obama is more surprised by argumenting that America needs to be rebuild economically to resume its leading position to a new life.
North Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream Guideline, which is on the Eastern Sea and directly connected the Western Europe to Russia, was established.
She will provide gas for a equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasprom wanted to come to this event with G · and Gloria.
More than 500 guests charged, including four government leaders, have attended the last Sunday on the East Coast of Orchester and on the finchmecker buffet of the introduction of the new Guidelines North Stream, Russia and Germany directly connected under the sea level.
The German Conzler Angelika Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his official Mark Rutte from the Netherlands, have jointly dressed the tax of the Ventilous, which transports the Russian Gas into Western Network.
With the new gas transport, 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gases per year will be delivered by a first road drive of 24 km long, connected by the region Sankt Petersburg with Mecklenburg forwards, to Western Europe.
A second road guide that has a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - will be completed by the end of 2012.
And you are already allowing the event of building a guide to themselves.
For Gazprom, the accurate and precise completion of this huge building work acts as a victory.
The project was strongly contrary in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North-Stream Pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, while avoiding any trip through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the groundway.
For this reason, these two countries lose a little of their power: for them it will now be more difficult to exercise pressure on Russia by threatening the access to western markets.
Warschau, the strongest involved in the debate, was not expected to compare the North-Stream Pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pacte" in connection with the covenant between Hitler and Stalin in 1939 to the occupation of Poland.
This means that the theme is politically seen primarily sensitive.
Western Europe has gained a further security of supply through the preparation of this Russian project.
However, this is on the cost of enhancement of energy, since the project has made a break between Western and East Europe.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the appropriate western countries, the strong gas consumption and its gas debt.
"This gas transport is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in organic way," was aware of François Fillon in the introduction of gas carrier, indicating in which degree the gross gas contracts are important also from political and economic sides.
All this explains the wide range of the Gazprom manager represented in Lubmin about gas management.
The building of this gas carrier is also an excellent technology.
The underwater guide consists of steel with beton numbering that it will be able to switch before ships.
It rests on the sea side, in about 200 m deep.
His building had to be removed from the Second World War II dating mine fields.
"About a hundred mines had to be removed or thrown in front of them," Jens Mâer, speaker of the Society of North Stream, said.
Moreover, strengthened movings to protect Fauna and Flora were to be taken.
The guide is a long snow of metal, heavy as 242 eiffel tubes that are interrupted by nothing throughout the lengths: neither by ventilation nor guardy.
A control platform was intended before the coast of Sweden, but the project responsibility took a distance because the Swedish had little power to see a Russian State society at the level of their coasts permanently.
"In the case of a hae, we lock the gasdurchlas in less than a minute," exactly Jens Mâer.
In the case of a leak, this gas in the gas carrier produces in the air.
However, this case is considered to be a little likely by the constructors, since the wheels were estimated to a constantity of a leck per 1000,000 years.
The State monitoring of gas transport is ensured by both a underwater robot that is driven to external observations by a marine chief and by a device circulating within the gas carrier.
It is the form of a cigarette, mixed a meter diameter, imported into the interior of the road and continued by the gas pressure.
After three full days of continuation through the driving at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most precise information about the possible deformation of the metal at its arrival.
The gas transport has been able to work for fifty years without to be subjected only to the smallest reparation.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bars at the access, 100 bars at the outcome.
Five companies have joined their powers to carry out this project.
However, the leadership remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E.ON and BASF (to 15,5%), as well as the Netherlands Gasunie and the French company group GDF Suez (9%).
These five companies have developed a company named North Stream, which is responsible for building and the operation of gas transport.
She has her seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly beneficial.
Gazprom thus dismissed the total capacity of its gas transport, even on a prolongable twenty-year-old contract.
"Gazprom will be covered for the total capacity, no matter how gross the actual transporting gas quantity is falling out," exactly Jens M.
The financing of the gas transport building was 30% of the shareholders and 70% of the bank loans.
All works should be 7.4 billion euros for both road guides.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment sum was 240 million.
However, the minority actors are obliged to recover their expenditure because gasprom is only the risk of detention.
The gas drive is at a sandwich, boarded coast stream at Lubmin from the East Sea.
The 4.5 meters high ventilation forms the gas output spheres.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other identification numbers of the incoming gas before it is translated into the German gas transport.
Since Sunday, this terminal has been granted with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour.
In full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand note book.
From a Italian company called to life about five years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the writing a new style again.
It has a flair of aventure, hours made with writing at Christmas.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular inbound,→ Gummiband, the egg colored pages, as older over the time.
However, the Moleskine notesbook, as you know today, has occurred in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo Company, which has its seat in Milan, decided to bring a different design notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company's actor, is assigned to the marketing of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an older manufacturing technology called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshaut), which covers a treewollack, for example, used for the circulation of poultry bonds.
This type of notebook was very asked among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has allowed an old and almost forgotten object to be resumed to the 20th century as an icon of a pregardist artist," said Mary Sebregondi, now responsibility for marks in Modo Modo.
Success comes.
between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and set up with a paragraph of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far away from the habitual production of the first years where only 3.000 notebooks were able.
Molekyne has the Italian border and is exported in 70 countries, even from France to the United States.
It is difficult to produce a phantomic picture of the buyers, since the notebook also welcomes businessmen and students and experts.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitical, cultural, and openly public customers.
The small, Italian enterprise, which counted 12 employees at its beginning, has been employed more than 100 employees and employees since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company split his notebooks in bookworks, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city, and understands to implement its ownity.
"We have followed the magazine and a new need of writing, which exists despite the excitement of the e-mails," said Mary Sebregondi.
This cultural travel is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine Company: the mark has recently launched an exhibition called "Detour (Omward) " in the architects and artists set up their own notebooks.
In August, the company also held the film festival in Locarno a link with leopard patterns on the market.
Moleskine benefited from success and this cultural magazine and understanded its products to diversify: toys, appointment calendars, fairs, computers... the mark shows the entire band size of articles.
A success that results in the plan: In Tuesday 2006, Modo was made by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, the current Syntegra Capital, and thus introduced a new chapter in the story of the Moleskine Company.
Why is the unemployment rate of unemployed employees remaining in such a high level?
Nearly 19% of the vulnerable people are looking for a job.
Today, the "15th week of the work for staff".
Despite a target-conscious public policy introduced in 2005, the rate of unemployment for prevented persons is always double as the average average value: 19% over 9% of the total population's unemployment.
Disgusting?
"No, so it emphasizes E日 Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adapt, which directs the "Week of the work for the employees".
"The progress achieved within five years is significant."
"Then the unemployment rate was not double, but three times so high."
"There is still a lot to do, despite this."
However, it is necessary to say that there continues numerous obstacles for unemployed unemployment before they get a job.
The elderly are more frequently: 37% are older than 50 years (17% in average).
They have a small level of qualification: 80% of them have no abiture and there are only 10,000 employees under the 2.3 million students with educational conclusion.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% in a total of 38% in a total.
Shortly, there are so many criteria that difficult for a new job input and that form the "the core of the problem", so that Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a 1992 founded union, which is helpful to buy employees.
So much to the real breaming.
Remember the inexcusableness, the spiritual endurance, which, though, develops slowly.
An enterprise conducted by the IMS Association in April for the La Cité magazine indicated that the questioned Manager has "a weak knowledge level of infirmants" that "overrepresented" is "of persons in rolls, psychical or intellectual minorities".
The result is that companies with more than 20 employees have a great way to achieve the employment goal of 6% of interrupted employees, which has been recorded in a law of 1987.
The numbers from 2008 refer to a quality of 2.6%.
"We are now at the 3%," reports Pierre Bla日, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization that is ordered to introduce contributions from companies that fail this law.
The evidence: The number of taxes of payment has decreased the sum of payable amounts between 2007 and 2011, even from 59.000 to 46.000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Law of 2005, which predicts increase in contributions, made a strong pressure on the companies, explained Pierre Bla. "
"But this improvement also brings real knowledge, especially in the gross company groups."
According to the Ministry of Work, only 59% of the workshops between 20 and 49 employees are interrupted by employees, companies with 100 to 199 employees, 82%.
Hazard: "What for a happiness"
Just before they bought the "Blue Service Days (20:45 hours), Eden Hazard and George's Leekens did not have their pleasure that they had the friendship game.
It would be too far to claim that it has given a secret understanding between them, but the image speaks symbolic bands.
Site on the side of the spectacular podium of the city de France would have been able to break out peace and peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his player's attack against Turkey, the Belgian National Tra's had no lobby for his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, progress and the fact that he is more."
"I want to look forward," assured the beauty liller from his side.
As regards the contrast between his presentation in the Club and the National Life"It is a unit that justifies everything."
"I'm in Lille all the year over what isn't the case."
"It's time to go to the beginning."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, delivered on Friday against Romania in relation to the match against France, to finally clarify.
However, without submitting the note of the "pleasure".
Since the age of 7 years, the French nationality has been celebrated, he has conducted his viable field movements between 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supported," he's been inactive.
This requires to strengthen the "single" character of this meeting.
So much in front: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be at the same time," he forgave.
"We've just walked through the way."
"Where to play them means great happiness!"
Likeness reads on his side with kindness "Stolenz".
"The proud, a galama" to go out.
"Stolz" also to be assured - in his property as "Neighbors" - that France" or a man has become a very high level, and that is a little more than one year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Bla's been doing work," he replied.
Although the next European Mastership is missing, the technician seems to share the aircraft with the blue (the French national eleven) ..., although Brazil's direction in 2014.
"We're smaller to get out gross," he stressed.
"We're going to plan something, the players are ambitioned, they're hungry."
"You will notice this in the next games." The game against France will be joined.
Portugal very confidential
The Portuguese mention of Paulo Bento sees with a gross optimism the return to Bosnia (22:00 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
During the play, both men had the squadity.
"In the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy community and, in particular, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no smallest influence of doubt that "La Selecçao", his national eleven, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will improve the quality of the European Mastership 2012.
For Portugal, this is in fact only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to reserve an enemy, even Bosnia.
In view of the game (0-0) on Friday in the Hâe of Zenica, it seems clear that the worms have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the party clearly over more than one hour, but the manhood was not able to press the so important stamp that had taken the pressure from her.
"This is a result which, however, is a certain risk because we have not reached a foreign court."
However, homes, in their luminous town de la Luz in Lisbon, are the Portuguese convinced that before a public that might be like heavy to the game, even if the party was, of course, announced as "very nice", the optimist but transparent Bento said.
"We expect a very short match, but we are perfectly convinced that we can win the top hand," explained the 42-year Portuguese tragedy.
"We continue to have a 50% opportunity to attend the European Mastership 2012," but the follower of Carlos Queiroz related.
The undetermined Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a gate.
One undetermined can already suffice to the Bosnians who also need a gate.
"This is a result which, however, has a certain risk because we have not reached a foreign court," Bento deceived.
"We will come against a man who has high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he adds.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese would have proposed to exercise a maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to give them no time to think."
A idea, under the condition that it is implemented this time in fact.
