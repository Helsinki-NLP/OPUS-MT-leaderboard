Everyone comes and uses transport systems.
In the country of progress, you often hear the same rate of wounds about the water quality or the loss of water.
Why are such weaknesses manifested in the transport system, why is their service always failing, or are transport engineers not competent or are there any more basic thing that happens now?
Arus and Lintas were studying about the movement of researchers and vehicles between two points and interactions they created each other.
Unfortunately, studying the arouse and studying hardly because the conduct of researchers cannot be predicted by a hundred percent of confidence.
Fortunately, researchers are inclined to act in a consistent spectacular rate; therefore, the loop and the spring of the tension have a viewful and smaller consistency can be more representative in matematics.
In order to represent the arus and to go better, a relationship between the three main characteristics has been set: (1) aur, (2) ate, and (3) a speed.

Finally, the team was responsible for success and failure.
This behaviour is increasing in the divorce between the pipelines and the team members.
The teams have the same simpleness standards as the conventional team, but there's a little difference.
Team members often work as a contact point for their direct physical groups.
They often have more autonomies than conventional team members because their team may meet a number of time zones that may not be understood by their local manager.

Why does the organization want through a process that eats time in terms of the organization of learning? One of the practical objectives of the concept of the organization’s learning is innovation.
