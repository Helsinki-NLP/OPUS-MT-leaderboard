The social map of the Ivanian resident is recognised as an electronic payment.
Amendments are expected to keep the leak on the passenger transport.
Since September 24, the organization of the citizens ' legacy travel has been changed with the use of the map of the Ivanian resident.
As reported by the Russian Government on the Ivan Area, changes are expected to keep the passenger leakage in the public passenger transport and bring a scheme of interim accounts in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No 161 FZ " O the National System".
In this way, the map of the Ivanian resident is recognised as an electronic payment.
Consequently, the conditions of its application are changed.
So, the filling limits are now fixed not in forests, as before, but in the amount of feeds, with winter and summer periods - not more than 400 rubles, and not more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the holders of the card on the issued in the transport of quotas will need to follow not the amount of poetry, but the rest of the feedingstuffs.
The value of the low travel for citizens is 1/2 of the tariff of the carrier.
The remaining half of the travel cost is a refund to the area budget.
The graph of the cart filling with monetary means remains in the past 24 month to 23 of the current month.
The new schedule on the map will have a number of advantages.
Thus, a detailed accounting of the expenses of money on the card is shown with accuracy to copees.
Furthermore, the possibility of return of counting, but unexpected feedback is shown.
We also add that the intercontract scheme with the carriers becomes transparency, since the half of the travel price is now paying the citizens, and it is exactly the same amount to the carrier.
No committee will be taken on the card of money.
In turn, Basiley Silkin, the head of the Department of Travel and Transport of Ivan, reported that in 2014 there were more than 33 million poets in the region with the use of the map, in 2015 nearly 25 million poets.
In the area of the budget for the benefit of the citizens with the use of the card, more than 470 million rubles have been provided.
On 1 September, the amount of refunds for these purposes was more than 312 million rubles.
When calling at 911 teacher is admitted to murder of a friend
During the 911 vote, the teacher of Shahnon Lab told the police that he had shot his friend and that they had needed to come home.
Lamb emphasized that there was a "peasing" in the house that lived, but probably was disappointed, and said that contacts of family members of the dead can be found at her phone.
Inside the house, the police discovered the body of Amy Prentiss and the note written in the hands of the white paper paper: "I am so sorry, I would like to return all back, I loved Amy, and she was the only woman who had ever loved me," says in the note, as the representatives of the organs signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who led two online courses at the Delta University of Cleveland, Mississippi, had been able to move 300 miles to the university camp, where the police believed he shot all the respectable teacher of the history of Ithan Schmidt on his office.
The police officer of the University of Delta Linn Baford reported that the university had learned about the shooting at 10:18 tomorrow.
He reported that Lamb had made that true call at 911 after that.
At the end of the day of the victim, there will be one more: The Lamb ended with it as soon as the police surrounded it.
On the day after the shooting in the training campaign for students and teachers to follow the closed doors, the bodies were still trying to put on one picture of the motive that Lamba was built.
The insects shared at both ends of the state, as well as the students and those who knew it helped to build a talentary portrait, but perhaps a peaceful teacher.
Students told that they were waiting for his jobs.
The police in Gothia, where Prentis was dead, reported that he was not complained about violence or voting.
Sam Schmidt included Lamba in a written book in which he expressed appreciation for the "beautiful people" with which he was crossed in his teacher's life.
Both of them were teached at the university of science and history, which included 17 teachers, and many students visited the lessons of the same and the other.
At the same time, there were some suggestions on issues.
A student who was well talking about Lamb, Brandon Bivers, reported that he seemed to be anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sakes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the year 2014-15 of his stress.
Earlier, Lamb asked the Delta State University to give him a vacation of disease, saying that he had some health problems.
This year, he had only trained two online courses.
Recent changes in the University Rules have indicated that the rate of the doctor on which Lamb had so sustainable work would not guarantee that he received a teacher's post automatically.
The President of the University of William Laforge reported that he had nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course Mr. Lamba had something in mind."
These are questions that Lamb will not be able to answer.
The police attacked Lamba after he fled from the campus when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot 38 calibres from the back court of the house, one mile south from his parents' house in the Greenville, Mississippi, reported the council of Washington Methel Johnson.
His car with a working engine still stood on the road.
It was unexpected why Lamb came to this house, although Johnson said she believed he knew he lived in it.
The lamb grows in those borders.
Lamb started working at the University of 3500 students in the city with a population of approximately 12000 in 2009 and trained geographical and pedagogical.
He received the degree of the doctor's pedagogic sciences in the same year.
One of the old friends of Lamba described him as a smart, charisant, and pleasant man.
Carla Hearston raced that she was 15, and Lambu was 20 years when they met by common friends.
She and her friends learned in older classs, and he was a classic older guy who tried to learn her to play on gitarr for several years.
In those years, he succeeded in women.
All of them were secrets when he was near," says Hearston, who now lives in Jackson, Brandon's village.
Lamb and Prentiss have seen at the time of the events a while.
During the 911 Lab, he said, "I killed my wife," but the registration of their marriage is not available.
The couple had a dog named Lytning, who lived with them in Gotha in a kirpical house, whose back side is going to the channel.
According to the police, the dog's okay.
The former husband of Prentis, Shawn O'Stin, told them that they had been divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they had a daughter now 19 years old.
"He's totally tired," O'Stin told about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in and played a blaz.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both on one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played time together on concerts from time to time.
O'Stin told his daughter to write a song.
Prestis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barman and a co-operative coordinator divorced programmes in the bar of the Julep Room in Gothie, said that he saw Lamba and Prentis on 5 September evening when Lamb finished playing on the gitary and mouth harmouse for few visitors.
No suspects were observed.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We were enjoying and looking at each other.
I mean, they were both very obscure.
Schmidt, a dead teacher, conducted the seminars for the first tourists and specialists in the history of the root Americans and the Americans, told Don Alan Mitchell, the teacher of the English in the same educational course.
He was married, and he had three little children.
He learned at the University of Kansas in Emphoria and was a president of the School Brothership and Student self-administration.
At the University of Delta in Cleveland on Monday evening, approximately 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in the memory ceremonie of light burning.
The wife of Schmidt Liz and Jeff Schmidt were also present at the ceremonie during which the University Hor sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The jobs will be renewed in the middle.
"We're trying to return our students," Laforge said.
Crisis passed.
Today the day of health.
Amy and Rohelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was helped to prepare the authors of Press Emily Vagster Pe'us in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santan in New Orleans.
The material was addressed in connection with the statement of the police that Lamba was called 911 after the murder of Schmidt, and that even though Lamb was talking about Princess as his wife when he called in 911, the information about their marriage was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to take less than at the festival season
Toys R Us reports that it will not take the same time for the festival season as last year, while the player and goods for children will ensure that it will provide a public staff and a temporary opportunity to work more hours.
The Company reports that it plans to deploy 40,000 people for work in the stores and on the opt bases throughout the country, less than 45,000 who were taken at the 2014 festival season.
Most slaves will be partly busy.
The company reported that it would begin to communicate with the applicants this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although a few months later, the purchase season is closer, and the companies are prepared for the best time to have enough states in stores and sales, waste and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox's talking about "sweeping" with Princess Diana
The Premier of the "Return to the Future" film about the great event for Michael J. Fox.
It was a note for similar reasons.
"We were sitting in the film and waiting for the arrival of the king's family, I noticed that the place with me was free, and here I was sent down - the Princess of Diana will sit with me," he said in the trainer to the quickly outcome on the screen "Return in time."
The movie is starting, and here I'm in mind that I'm literally at your hands and in one false wheat from meeting Princess Wells.
"Return in time" is a "Return in the future" film, including interviews with Fox, Ley Tompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the Registry Robert Landkis and the executive producer Stephen Spilberg.
The Premier of the "Return to the Future" film was 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spilberg, "is the biggest movie about traveling in the time that has ever been taken away."
"Return in time" will be available to VOD, DVDs and some films in October.
The UN Chapter states that there is no military decision in Syria
The Secretary-General Mr. Gi Mun states in response to Russia ' s military support of Syria that for almost five-yearly conflict, the invasion growth will only destroy violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN Chapter again invited all participants, including the United Nations Security Council, to join and support integrated negotiations to find a political decision.
Mr. Gi Mun stated at the press conference in the midst that he planned a meeting with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Council of the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France for the discussion of the General Assembly in this month.
He denounced that the differences in the Council and among the Syrians and the authorities were "insolvable."
Mr. Gi Mun invited five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in the solution of the nuclear programme on Iran and in the examination of the Syrian crisis.
8 results of the investigation that Donald Trump doesn't worry
They were trying to put on him a bullet of the producer.
Others dismissed him, thinking like a shit.
And some need scandal.
However, as some replies are trying to deal with the high situation of Donald Tromp in the results of the investigations, they did not succeed (a.k.a.).
Ten of the 11 last national investigations have demonstrated the benefit of Donald Tromp in double numbers, and some start seriously asking what this means for the insurance of the chances of receiving a name.
Of course, it's just the beginning of a choice cycle.
Nothing of this means that Trump has the opportunity to nominate the Rep of the Party.
The experts indicate that Rick Perry at that time had committed his advantage to German Kayne's entitlement in 2011, and that no one of them had gained the nomination process.
And there are reasons why he would fight at the general elections.
But the external groups such as the Supreme Political Activity Committee, Jeb Bush, and the Economic Conservative Group of the Cross Club, recognize the inevitative force of Trump and begin to provide their dollars to surrender it.
Here are some numbers of questions that say that inevitability is not just a transitional phase:
The ratings of sympathy for Trump were 180 degrees.
Immediately before Donald Trump announced his candidate in the middle of June, the question at Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 replies were locally addressed to this magnate in the field of unnecessaryness.
It was 40 per cent in the middle of July.
At the beginning of August, 52 per cent.
Now six of the 10 replies are locally related to Donald Trompe.
Approximately three of the 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators are obtained at the beginning phases.
The question of Quinnipiac in Iowa, last week, found that 60 per cent of the repases there are aware of Trompe.
Two thirds of the vote for the GOP would establish the Tram as a candidate.
In the question of CNN/ORC last week, 67 per cent of the replies said that they had been "comforted" or "compliance" if Trump had been candidate.
Only two of the 10 say they would be "reached," if he was a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say that they would be "inspired" against 40 per cent of those who say the same about Trumpe).
Next at the level of anxiety?
Marko Rubio, who has only 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the repurchases say that they will "not be satisfied" or "rejoice" if the favorite Jeb Bush will be candidate.
The majority of the reps are not considered the Tremp temperature as a problem.
While the Trumpa is massively criticised for its worstness and disturbance, 52 per cent turning to the resistance of the electors throughout the country believe that there is a suitable temperature to be a president, as ABC News/Washington post made on Monday.
The same number figures the first in the country in the closed meeting in Iowa, where the 52 per cent of the replies believe that he has the same person that could be the main commander, Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent believe that he is not the person that may be effective on the post, and nearly six of the 10 independent electors say that his temperature is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
Response electors are used to do this.
When they look forward to their travels, the resistance electors think that Trump is serious.
On the question who is the most probably winner in the GOP nomination, four of the 10 said that Trump was a favorite, the CNN/ORC question last week.
It's not the same when four of the 10 placed Jeb Bush on the end of July.
Full distortion: The GOP electors had not previously a correct cristal.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 replies chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported the possible candidate of Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that the GOP electors consider the Trump campaign convinced.
Even if the replies had been spent around the other candidate, the Trump continued before all the rest.
The figures indicate that such discharges, mostly, are playing for the benefit of Trump, and at the same time, those who are not supported, are equally distributed among those supporting more than ten other candidates.
However, the question carried out by the University of Monmouth on the beginning of September shows that Trump is almost always supported by the majority.
He warns Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marko Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeba Busha at 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Cassich and Crissie at 33 points.
He has nobody with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that covers him?
Ben Carson spent businessmen at 19 points of hypothesis with "one per one".
A few more half of the Donald Trump parties say that they were before.
The new CBS/NYT question on Tuesday shows that only half of the voters supporting the Trump say that they are confident of their votes.
Obviously, many things can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he never changes.
46 percent say that they remain open for other candidates.
However, the most stressed competition in the Trump at the moment - with Ben Carson's neuro-chirurgy colleague, but the electors who say they were before, mostly, will choose the Trump.
Six of the 10 replies say that they are with Trom in immigration.
Since the time Donald Tromp called the immigrants from Me'a ' on ' on ́ ́ ́ ́ in his opening campaign, the theme of immigration became the most current in 2016.
Some are concerned that the Trompe Power will distort the key electors of Latin American origin from the resistance of the Party and prevent the rapending.
But in question of the ABC/Post on Monday, six of the 10 replies say that they are with Trom in immigration issues.
Thus, until the immigration is attached to the general attention, it seems that Donald Tromp remains at the same position.
Disappointment by the Government brings new trades.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now considering a support for about half of the resistance electors, mainly because of their status of outsides.
Sex of the 10 replies on Monday, the new ABC/Post question, states that they want a political authside rather than a person with an experience in the Government.
And they are also disappointed to Washington.
The Question of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, held two weeks ago, shows that three of the four replies in Iowa are disappointed by the activity of the resistance in the Congress, 54 per cent "incomplete" and 21 per cent "in anger".
The Government will decide to judge pension indexations in October.
Vice-Premier RF Olga Gladz stated that the Government is currently seeking alternatives for the implementation of the Pension Indexing Act in 2016 at the real level of inflation, the RG.
She noted that the decision should be made until 8 October, until the draft budget was submitted to the Government for the year.
Moreover, the bamine discusses the option of prolonging the decision on the refrigerator of the Russian pension.
The hunger noted that the amount of pensions was 350 billion billion.
The penalty indexation is likely to be so much for the year.
According to the vice-premier, there is no urgent decision on the issue of who should pay contributions for non-governmental citizens.
The hunger believes that if a person does not work at his own initiative and does not work, it is not fair to the unprotected category of citizens that it will be for him.
Earlier, the MMI reported that there were two options for the balance of Mrs Budget in the cabinet.
Why are they often disappointed and red?
The doctor-oftalmolog Tatian Levasov answers:
Our ages are shields that protect the eye emblem from the small parts that are located on them.
Remembering the rule of cleaning, we often contribute to the development of blafarite.
Output:
Don't treat your eyes with your hands, carry with you a special heat salpet forever;
1 to 2 times a day, purify the end of the century from the cup in them on the day of things.
Cleaning procedures are inevitable to comply with heavy compressions with the opening of treatment grass (shalfe, romance), the deep secret of salt iron, and then the massing of the centuries, which should be carried out by the round motion of fingerprints;
Do not use the spectrum-containing.
They dry and dry the skin and contribute to a greater deterioration of the secret of salt railways.

Girinovski needed to remove from the Russian threshold of the brotherhoods.
The leader of the LDPR Vladimir Girinovski believes that from the national community a mention of the brothers ' union should be removed.
He stated that at the Gosm's meeting, the Russian Office of Finance reported.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and killers!
"The very long guinea, the most long in the world, even sportsmen are not to stand," Girinovski said.
The Deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the fourth parts containing the following pieces:
In 2014, Girinovski stated that the current guinea should be mentioned to "God, King of conservation", and the Russian tricolor replaced by emperor flags writes polyt.ru.
Asad invited all the forces to join terrorism.
President of Syria Bashar Asad invited all forces to join terrorism.
Asad is sure that if she wants to cope with the problem of refugees, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that it accepts or does not accept refugees, but that it is necessary to remove the causes of this problem.
If the soldiers are concerned about the judgment of refugees, they will stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the matter of refugees," he said in the RT interview.
We must continue dialogue on behalf of the achievement of consensus.
However, if we want real successes, they are not until people go away until blood-proliferation continues and people feel secure.
"So we can reach consensus, but we can't make anything until we won the terrorism in Syria," he stressed.
On the other hand, there were about 500 000 migrants in the Russian countries this year, including Syria.
The draft Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world is the most important since World War II.
There is no exception that there may be thousands of migrants in the extremist group of the Islam State.
Members of the organization prohibited in Russia may use a situation in order to create their cells in the EU in order to lead terrorists to activities.
Dutch city residents built a flight feast for refugees.
In the last month, Germany became a refugee leader, although she recently strengthened the border control to keep their attacks.
According to the authorities, approximately 800 000 migrants will come to Germany until the end of this year, although some experts call a significant number.
Since September beginning, over 90,000 refugees have come to the country.
Correspondent Bi Bi-by-si Jenny Hill stayed in Darmstadt town, whose residents show a very warm reception to migrants.
Jeremy Corbin debutters the Premier Minister ' s issues at the session
After Mr. Corbina ' s elections, he was devoted at the Premier Minister ' s session, it was expected with great impatience
The new leader of the Leaborist Party of Jeremy Corbin will soon take place at the Premier Minister ' s session for the first time, taking action with David K’eron.
Mr. Corbin will discuss the first of the six issues issued in the second half of the day, and, mostly, the presision and members of the Parliament from the Leiborist Party will be able to follow.
He spoke with the call "learer theater and more facts" on a married demonstration thing.
He also stated that some meetings could be lost by leaveing them to the colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary trial of Mr. Corbin as a ru-roo; it will occur after the assignment of their shadow office and his words at the annual Conference of Tred-Unions on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Leaborist leader decided to stand silent during the execution of the national village on the service on Tuesday, during the 75-year-old Bitwey celebration in Britain, during the criticism of a number of conservative members of the Parliament and became the subject of several advance articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbine's decision not to sing the State guinea has drawn attention
Mr. Corbina's Press Secretary stated that he was "standing in a postal silence" and recognized "the Royal WWS Heroism in Bitwe for Britain".
However, the member of Mr. Corbin Owen Smith's shadow office reported Newsnight at BBC 2, that he would advise the leader of the leaborists to sing a national "unless" of his conviction if it was necessary to cancel the moon.
Almost a decade of the tenth ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbin's team, aware of the differences in economic, defence and international policies, while less than one six member of the Part had supported him as leader.
The political co-representant BBC Robin Bronth says that political divisions are also " covered by steps" in the lebory party after Mr. Corbine was appointed to be assigned to the Union and to pay compensation by the Government.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Conference of the Tread-Unions that the Leiborist Party had introduced amendments to cancel the idea of the total.
For a few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Labour Shane Minister and Pension Payments stated that there was a "full clarity" in the party because it was only in the opposition of Government's plans to reduce the range from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Leaborists to whom David Cameron will meet at the "currier box" in the last ten years since the Conservative Party leader.
The Leader of the Leaborists who had promised another approach to politics states that he had "attracted collective resources" to address Mr. Cameroon's questions and received more than 30 000 proposals.
The Member of the Parliament of the Aillington North stated that the Premier Ministry ' s issues were caused too much conflict and that it would be too sustained from anxious response and exchange of quantities, rather than promised to focus on serious issues such as poverty, irregularity and problems that arose before the youth.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angel Igle, the Ministry of Economy in the shadow office, would replace him on the issues of the Prime Minister when he was disabled - for example, when Mr. Cameroon is outside the border.
He also understood the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the word as possible, saying that he was referring to the Middle Palace of John Bercow to discuss this issue.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to avoid the political style of the Jarmarian Balkan, often associated with the procedure of the Prime Minister, but recognized that he had failed several years later.
Since the first translation in 1990, the Prime Minister ' s issues became a key indicator of the leader ' s views, their ability to manage the Community and the reputation of other members of the Parliament, although the critics claim that it has become a carcature and requires extent reforms.

The Sterling Pound shall increase the payment in Great Britain
The Punctuation of FTSE 100 has grown up on the basis of the payment in Britain, and the SABMiller Index has risen from the proposal for purchasing SABMiller.
Since May to June, in Britain, bonuses were increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the similar period of the past year.
Increasing speed has been higher since 2009, and it has been met as a transfer to a more early time for possible growth of caterpillars.
The pound of sterling grows more than 1% per dollar and $1.5505, and 0.84 per cent by €1.3730.
FTSE index 100 increased up to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In the general background, SABMillers were assigned to 20% through the proposal for purchasing from the competitor AB InBev.
The transaction would unit two largest beverages worldwide, with breaches such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's actions increased by 0.9% at the background of a competitive group of producers of LUX Richemont.
The latest data on the sales of Richemont were overall expectations and showed that sales in China - on the key market for Burberry - began to grow again.
Glencore's actions increased 5 per cent after the high-scale giant stated that it was able to obtain $2,5 billion by allocation of assets, which had been made in the reduction framework.
The Paper Production Group and Mondi's Package materials were the leaders of the index falling - 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs decreased the rating of the group to "sell".
The JD Sports shares increased after the company, the supplier of the clothing, reported that 83 per cent growth had reached tax charges for a half-year to 46.6 million pounds.
Boss JD Sports says that higher payments can prevent expansion
The Executive Director JD Sports Peter Caugil says that the increase in the minimum payment for British slaves means "a greater purchase of capacity in potential consumers' hands".
However, it is unlikely that such purchasing ability will overcome the increase in the cost of the labour costs, he says.
The costs could affect JD Sports extension plans, added that the number of additional vacations could be decreased.
Metcash starts a campaign at the initiative below to combat Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi pressure in South Australia and West Australia.
The Optical Food Provider on initiative below launched a campaign for the protection of the IGA market share in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the future impact of Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is prepared to open two opt stores and the first of 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of the year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthened with food suppliers and moved IGA branches through the marketing in leading SMEs and networks and the Adelaide Show activities.
The campaign is attended by IGA and suppliers, such as the manufacturer of the frozen Simmo's from Densboro, which is a degust in IGA stores, and the owners of the magazines that sold continuous customers tickets on the South Australia Football League.
It is expected that Metcash will reveal more details of its protection on September 29 - the day when this optical supplier of food, alcoholic drinks and farming products will carry out its annual day of the investor.
There is a lot of horses, since in South Australia and Western Australia stores under IGA broadcast are nearly 30 per cent of all Metcash magazines and higher rentality than the Metcash IGA network in East States.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are as customers of roads, so the market is more favorable for IGA leaders than in the States of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in the United States and 24 per cent in the WA compared to about 14 per cent in East States.
However, analyses such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi covers 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months after the opening of its first magazines, taking the amount of all present players, but mainly in independent players.
In the report on this week, Tom Kirat, Morgan Stanley's analytical report, IGA's guests may lose 360 million dollars per year and Metcash is 250 million dollars until the end of 2016.
Prognoses are expected that Aldi will open 25 stores in the SA and 30 in the WA in the year, with a sale of $500 and $600 million in these markets respectively.
The loss of expenditure and sales of food products at the high level of constant costs of Metcash may cost about 13 million income before the payment of percentages and taxes, Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash loses the market share in east states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is the recent investigation of Morgan Survey found that IGA is the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that the sales of food products of Metcash will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.5 per cent in 2018, reducing the market share of the company from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager X's Duglas, the foundation of the Magellan Financial Group, noted that Metcash could be lost for decades.
The Metcash company from publicly commenting on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it is supposed that the member of the Board of Directors of the Company of Metcash has been associated with Mr. Douglas last week.
The IGA share on the market has decreased from 18 to 14 per cent from 2010, and the Metcash income from business in the field of foods that the company provides approximately 1200 IGA capitalers has 43 per cent compared to 2012 as a result of the operational delegation and due to the pressure on sales and rentality indicators.
Nevertheless, the company does not grant more than 150 million dollars per year for the balance of different prices in Coles and Wool prices for thousands of places in marriage and by helping IGA travellers to rebuild trade areas, as well as a rapidly expanding assortiment of fresh products and a widespread choice of food plants.
The Director-General Metcash Ian Morris says that the balance of prices and trade restructuring of areas is to be marketed and hopes that the company should increase the pure arrival in 2017, first in four years.
Tanasi Cockinakis supports President Tennis stive Hilli
Tanasi Cockinakis deserves the beginning, not critics for his behavior.
Tanasi Cokkinakis has been directly harmful in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Kiros, and for his behavior, it deserves a beginning more than critics, as President Tennis said Steve Hill.
Cokkinakis, the youngest in a talentary duette and often called "Special Ks", was unnecessary in the center of attention because of the injury of Cyrus with the Wall Vabrinca tourist on Montreal Masters.
In the past, during the heavy cave of the cave in Cincenti, the Cockinakis and his opposite Ryan Harrison had two times been able to deal with, and Harrison said, "Wabrina had to put on the kidneys of Cyrus, and I had to put on the lobbys of this guy."
C the last time Cockinakis saw a cracking racket after the judge in his feet saved Risshar Gasque from the possible damage to the US Open, Hilli loyally protects the Cockinakis.
Youth is currently located in Glasgo with the Gret for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomich in a single class in Cubka Davis against Britain.
"I am deeply concerned about one thing, exactly that Tanasi was in conflict," said Hill.
He really broken the racket when he had his feet on the US Open, but he was not the first player who broken the racket when the hopes were breaked, and I know Tanasy enough well to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But actually he had a very good owner in a lot of provokation situations in the United States, with Harrison, etc., and I am sure he deserves confidence.
He's surrounded by a great team, he has a family, and I just think it's been a little unfair to him.
He's a very grown 19-year-old man, he works a lot, he's a good job in the team, he has never had a problem with other players, his respect outside the card, he's intensely trained, he's in a good form, he's a very comprehensive and developed young man, and I think he should be evaluated in worth.
Hilli also supported the decision to forgive Kiros for the important torture starting on Friday, putting "common agreement" as a right outcome for all, but considering that the guy from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term player.
"For the first thing, we want the team to concentrate completely on the cat, not on the round [Kiros]," said Hill.
And I think Nick has taken the power very quickly that people like the Federer and Marrey, he's in his eyes, he's allowed a number of serious mistakes and deserves all that he gets, but we're trying to help him to understand the consequences of his effects, and I think it's necessary to get him out of the center of attention for a while so that he can think about them, and it's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency situation, closes the border, detains migrants
In announceing the extreme situation, Hungary overflow the border with Serbia on the southern border and detained those trying to go into the country illegally to keep the stream of migrants inside.
On the border, anger has occurred - hundreds of migrants have fallen on the border territory, which is extremely negative to Serbian authorities.
It was undetermined at the road of the two countries' control-travel points, and those who fled from inflammated violence to their families were cut off the tents and based on this.
However, deficiency increased.
When the police headquarters surrounded them, the migrants cried "Open the border" and cried to the Hungarian police's address.
The sign of protest was rejected from food and water.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia announced the "inacceptable" expedition of migrants from Hungary when they are more and more from Eden and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the problem solution, not of the coherent damage.
It is necessary to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the next days,” said Prague Ivice Dačich.
Volunties at the Hungarian-Serbian border began on the day after a block from 28 countries was unable to repeat the general immigration policy at the Joint Meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to carry out the general responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refugees in overflow Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future (in the month or the end of the year) the agreement would be able to take 120,000 refugees from Hungary, including refugees from Hungary.
Conceller of Germany Ang and Austria on Monday need to gather an extreme union for the discussion of the immigration crisis covered by the continent on Sunday.
Hungary, however, does not hope that Brussels or Neighbours act.
The emergency situation declared on Tuesday in two southern regions has made the authorities more powerful to action against the crisis, which allowed them to cross the roads and to carry out the courts on the delivery of refugees.
However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary Peter Siarto stated that his country was also planning to deal with a cross-border coast of the border with Romania to cross the stream of migrants through the country, now when it had finished the shipment at the Serbian border.
The CBS News Correspondent of Dagata reported that even the prisoners were connected to the emergency rate to the end of the breakdown between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary became the main "worst place" and the point of crossing the cross-border union for cross-refugees, many of which I was held as refugees - war victims in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Victor Orban Prime Minister states that the majority of people in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees, victims of warfare rights, and this point of view is strictly differing from the opinions of other EU countries in Germany.
The new laws entering Hungary in force for midnight now consider a transcurring or injury of a 4-metric (13-foot-foot-foot-bound-bound-bound-bounded-bounded by the Government to the southern border with Serbia, and include more longer terms for those who are accused of trade.
"Furthermore, because of the situation of mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares an emergency situation," said the journalists, the representative of the Government of Zoltan Kovač in the South Seged.
We clearly understand: illegal crossing of the border is crime.
The formal parliament must still sanctify the distribution of military forces expected for a week, but reporters who are on the border have already been present for a few days of observation.
Herd Bacondy, national security adviser of Orban, reported the concept of 45 authorised bodies and tried to cross the border at the same border, and 15 others are within the country.
They crossed the border, broke the debt, are currently under the police and are accused of compliance with administrative violations under new laws.
The powers are quickly restoring the depth.
On Monday morning, the Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passengers on the border with Serbia, in order to block one of the travels of the railway, with a wheel-smoking wagon.
The Bess has passed through the border near Riosca (Hungria), since the Hungarians have placed a service room for the cross of people inside the metal of the container, and the people have put to one another to break inside.
Inside, there were about 20 percent, and thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants held a major car trace from Serbia to Hungary and announced the refusal of food and water until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's benefit over Bernard Sanders has reduced two in the national question
The former Secretary Hillary Clinton continues to maintain a double advantage in the democracy round throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders follows it.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of the original democratic electors (below 58 per cent), and Sanders and 27 per cent second (top 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Bayden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential round, is supported by 15 per cent of the prime democratic electors.
In more than five months before the early elections of opposition, most democratic electors say that they have been determined too early with the candidate to support.
Clinton parties are more confident of their choice than supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News investigation last month, Clinton lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders got some bonuses.
Clinton maintains great benefits between women and the dead, but this benefit has been decreased.
Her support among men has fallen hardly, and Sanders is just five points away from her.
The preferential of the Clinton democracy electors to 50 years has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now on the staff.
However, Clinton still has a great privilege among the elderly electors.
In the past month, Clinton persecuted Sanders for a double number among the liberals, but Sanders has now the benefit of five items in this group.
Almost half of the primary democratic electors throughout the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if she became candidate from that party.
The fourth would support her with some reservations and 15 per cent would only support her because she was a candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
It may not be surprised that Clinton's present parties, most likely, will show more enthusiasm to her.
Among those who are currently not supporting Clinton, views are more contrary - only about fourth with enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of the prime democratic electors say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the less quantity of resistance electors speak the same about their leader, Donald Trompe (35 per cent).
When Clinton's partners are questioned why they want to see her candidate, the most popular response is that she has a needed experience (16 per cent), then that it is now a president's time (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 per cent).
Clinton's parties also refer to the association associated with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called the question and opportunities for choice.
Since the vice-President considers the potential participation in elections, 57 per cent of the original democrat electors would like to join the rock - even if the third believes that it is not appropriate.
When they ask who they want to see among the candidates from the party, the original democratic electors in most cases are called Baiden.
Among Clinton's sides, more than half says they would choose Bayden second, more than Sanders.
If Byden decides not to issue his candidate from the Democrat Party, Hillary Clinton's benefit over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Bayden among the participants of the chat to 30 points without it.
Fifty-five percent of democratic electors have seen the candidate in Clinton with the best chances of winning at the general elections; however, the number was decreased by 78 per cent last month.
According to this indicator, Byden has increased, but the percentage of those who consider it as the most probably candidate has increased.
However, responding to the question that the most important is in the candidate, democracy electors choose other options other than the opportunities to be chosen.
Similarly, in the past month, none of the candidates from democracy or potential candidates is an inappropriate name for these original electors.
Democracy candidates, or potential of candidates, have shown a good result of some key characteristics among the original electors from their party.
The majority of Clinton, Sanders and Bayden considers the honest and deserving confidence of people who have good leaderships.
Byden of all three leads honestly, and the strong part of Clinton in its leading qualities.
Thirty per cent of the prime democracy electors do not consider Clinton to be honest and deserving confidence, twice more than those who say the same about Sanderse (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain view of it.
Primary democratic electors also generally consider the similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Bayden.
In all these measures, approximately four democracy electors have no opinion on Sanders.
Although the issues of the personal mail box and the server at Hillar Clinton continue as its Master Secretary, most original democratic electors are satisfied with its explanation on this account and believe that it has not affected their general opinion.
But this is a very different story in the American public at all.
The half of the Americans today is not satisfied with its interpretation, but only about the third.
The opinions of the public were still divided in March after this story had been made.
The majority of the Americans say that the e-mail farm has never affected their general opinion on Clintton, although 36 per cent say that their opinion was deteriorated.
It is mainly a rep, more than six of each 10, who claims that their opinion about Clinton has been deteriorated.
Although Clinton considers the honest and deserving confidence of the electors from its party, it continues to be a problem for it among the registered electors at all: only 32 per cent it is a honest and deserving confidence, eight points below the past month, and 15 compared to mama.
Seventy-two per cent of registered electors do not consider her honest and deserving confidence.
At the same time, 55 registered electors throughout the country do not consider the Trump honest and deserving confidence.
Clinton and Trump both, however, receive good signs on leader quality.
Of six protested candidates, Bayden, Carson and Bush are the best result of honesty.
Most people see a more honest person in Sanderse than not, but, as about Carson, many have no opinion on him.
The range of errors for the selection of 351 primary democratic electors consists of 6 percent points.
Following the results of the national investigation, Ben Carson closed to Donald Trompe
Ben Carson came to Donald Trump in the last question CBS/New York Times
Two of these candidates took half of the votes of the electors in a new question, leaving all the rest in the search for opposition under the feet
Resistance electors throughout the country continue to support Trompa massively, which increased by 23 per cent in the recent CBS debate on Fox News last month, up to 27 per cent in the question held on Tuesday.
But Carson went up for the same period from 6% to 23%.
The question also showed that Carson was being supported in all demographic groups by enhancing Trump in a group of higher educational electors.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Cascich, returned with Governor Wisconsin Scott Wooker, whose support fell from 10 per cent last month to 2 per cent.
The former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Hakabi and Senator of Florida Marko Rubio together takes a third place of 6%.
The range of errors for the choice of 376 reply electors in this new question consists of plus-minus 6%, which was carried out in September.
The recent issue of CNN/ORC, on the last week, showed Carson's growth in trials - demonstrating 19 per cent support among the reprends, with 32 per cent support.
The last question of ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is aware of Carson.
With regard to the increased support of Carson last week, Trump made a few critical accidents in the address of the former neurochirurg, even when Karson apologized for the doubt of the Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of the college Baruch
Approximately two years after the student was lost during the ritual of a brotherhood in the Mountains of Pokono in Pencane, the accusation of murder was committed against five people.
"The members of Pi Delta Psi from the New York College Baruch's brotherhood on Chan "Micla" Denga during the meeting in September 2013 and did not deliver him to the hospital, which caused him to die," reported the police.
The Office states that a student with an eye-linked and a 30-pound rubber with a sand behind the back of his backs have been held several times until he tried to reach the goal of the surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a disease and then fell out of consciousness.
The members of Pi Delta Psi were not called in 911 when Deng lost awareness and waited for an hour before he was brought to the hospital, they said in the police.
However, they found time to change Denga's clothes, find his symptoms in Gu and contact Andy Meng, the National President of the Brothership, to ask the advice as he told at the press conference of Chris Vagner Police Boss.
"In this moment the members of the brotherhood began to take personal property by putting the brotherhood goods above the health of Michael Denga," said the boss Vanger.
He couldn't save him, and he ended at the morning.
According to the record of the survey, Deng received a few stupid traumatics, towels and poverty.
"Too many families have suffered from brotherhood dedication rituals, since at least one student dies during them each year, starting from 1970," said Duglas Fairberg, representing the Dang family, in his statement.
Brotherships and their members must be responsible, and this step from the authorities is very important.
Monroe's jury offices were dismissed for the third degree of murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, are accused of violence against a new and criminal negotiation.
"We want to be responsible not only for a division of participants, but if there is any sanction that is all officially or neofly, it is it," Vagner said on the press conference on Tuesday.
The College Baruch prohibited brotherhood and the national brotherhood excluded its structure.
What will happen when the Federal Reserve will increase rates
Increasing taxes will occur, and the "bucks market" will be spent, the rate of obligations will grow, and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to be, and how long it's going to continue.
Specificly, the history has little to explain about time.
The recession was only 11 months after the first increase of the rate and for 86 months.
The cruelty of the Federal Reserve in higher rates often, although not always, determines the reaction of economic and financial assets.
Therefore, the United States Central Bank administration stresses so strongly that investors should not focus on when he starts to increase rates, but on how much adjustment it will take.
Actually, in the game of variables.
Finally, however, the market participants can find that the whole degree around the increase of rate is overwhelmed.
"The first increase in the Federal Reserve of Global Financial Crisis will be uncertainly interpreted by some, as the sign of the end of the debt era," reported Julian Jessop, the head of the international economy specialist in Capital Economics, in its commentary for customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of rate in the United States to more normal, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse, which many are afraid.
It doesn't mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
This is how some economic areas could respond depending on historical trends:
As the market has already seen in the last month or about, the expectation of increased tax may lead to insufficiency for a while.
However, in increased rate, the consequences are usually not such dramatic.
"It does not seem to have income from shares for 12 to 24 months after the first step, that is, likely again, reflects delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank in recent investigation of the results of the increase in the rate by the Federal Reserve.
If specific, the market in the last 35 years is rarely changed - approximately 14 per cent - in the case of the increase of the rate remains sufficient for 250 days after it (a average growth of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to the normal state of the average rate of 14.4 per cent for the last six, the recent analysis made by Bob Dolom, the main trade specialist in Nuveen Asset Management, in Barron's.
In Germany, the result of valuable booes has the trend to become more expressed at the stage of increased taxes, and the income from the shares begins to be decreased.
Recessions are the fact of economic life, but increases in rate often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that have not previously and may have a recession.
In principle, the internal internal product will be almost at its lowest point for all the time of the increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases the tax increase from 1950 was only two times lower than 4.5 per cent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 he was 3.6 per cent, there was little believer that it was long, while in the third quarter it was only 1.5 per cent, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in the rate of such instable economic background may be riskable and will ask "whether this time will be otherwise", reported in Deutsche.
The market participants are prepared to increase the rates of the Federal Reserve System for the whole year, and their view is attached to the meeting of the Open Market Federal Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many experts on economics and economicists believe that FOMC could be able to confirm the increase in the rate at this meeting, the furniture trade is only 25 per cent likely.
"In our study since 1950, all increases of rate until today have been located in a super-creasing financial rate in the BDP, which covers the pre-receiving pica, very quickly after the beginning of the restoration," says the report.
In contrast, this was extremely slow recovery after the worst recess during the selected period.
It is currently the longer than the Federal Reserve System expected from the end of the latest recession; the record of 35 months has been 74 months and has not yet been completed.
The fixed income is also instabil while the market is expecting to increase the rate, and this scenario is sometimes like that of which it is used for action.
The principle of the difference is that the effectiveness of liabilities will be faster than for action when the Federal System changes the rate.
In the case of liabilities, it seems that the income changes the vector at the same time after the first increasing/reduction rate in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increased rate, the eligibility of liabilities is immediately falling,” reports Deutsche.
Specialists from Charles Schwab believe that the increase in rate will lead to the advancement of long-term and short-term liabilities by making more flat.
High-level commitments often behave better in such a climate, although "we are still in fear of debt," says Cathy Jones, an analysis of fixed income in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already been adapted to the expected results of the Federal System Policy.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the fall of inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has been focused on more harder monetary policy," she wrote.
Percentage of rates on short-term debt increased, increased credit advances, increased volatility - all the characteristics of the market in the enhancement of the Federal System Policy.
In general, companies leading their main business in the United States win from increased rate, and the production will be more attractive.
International debt firms will be in the worst position, since a dollar makes their production more decent in the world market space and their dearest in the financial.
"History shows that "quality" actions demonstrate market efficiency over three months after the initial rate increase," said Goldman Sachs analyses in the client report.
Companys with a stabil financial with the company with non-stable with the results of each increase in rate in 1994, 1999 and 2004 in average of 5 per cent points.
Companys with a high capital income and low-volatility actions also showed better efficiency than low-quality action, in average of 4 (percentage) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will be a big question.
Companys with a high percentage of floating rate will lose more, according to Goldman.
Furthermore, the consumers will benefit from the $1.
The stakeholders could also see the income by a higher income, although experts appear in how quickly this happens.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of Classic FM," a member of the Parliament of the conservators Andrew Bingham
The Member of the Conservators of Andrew Bingham criticized the "decrease of standards"
It proves that it becomes all less independent of the commercial competitor
The BBC Music Awards also focused on, saying that the premium was just covered with Brits.
The colleague on the Parliament of Damien Collinz, who was on The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is converted to Classic FM," said the leader of the members of the parliament, encouraging the television company to prove that it does at least something that commercial companies do not do.
The Member of the Conservators of Andrew Bingham also stated BBC's guidance that it would be that the public radio station " is " stupid" and becomes even less dislike from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3" - I don't like to use the word "simplification" - but it's converted to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards premium last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else -- here are two examples that the first came to me, in which you actually just copy what is on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The Director-General BBC rejected the accusation, acknowledging that BBC Radio 3 and remotely before his commercial opponent, when the case is deprived of the life of audience and education.
What I'm learning by Radio 3, I don't know about the class anywhere.
And his loyalty to living statements and creation will actually not be compared to anyone.
"It's really very important, I think the interest of Radio 3 in searching for a new life and in moving new productions," he said.
The BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey said that the radio stations had to work much more in order to work with audience than in the past because the British are less educated in class.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child who had been attacked on the five commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Mass Information and Facility.
A member of the parliament of Tory Damien Collinz attacked The Voice - a talent show that BBC sold at the Netherlands Talpa Media for the orientation price of 22 million pounds of sterling.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed as regards the lack of originality and different parts?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which as judges, Paloma Fayt and Boy George, was made in "typical BBC style".
He added what he wanted from the Corporation to find that "hit in his own household horse" at the next time it was going to launch a funny project.
However, he does not consider needed to prevent the order of the new seasones of The Voice in the future or the use of money to those who have the license collection, to other forms.
The growth of the Internet sales was maximally quiet in August, and it may be a wine for Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, increasing online sales was seven percent
The most slow growth in the past month was observed in 2000
Online sales were actived three years ago because of the use of shopping machines
Experts are convinced that November Black Friday could contribute to the holding of the contract
During about ten years, the virtual shopping has experienced a bomb that converts many centres of streets in Britain to the city of the village.
However, the experts say that now there are signs of online sales balance, since the last data showed only seven per cent increases during the first three months of 2015.
Common online costs in August showed a minimum increase from the way they started to fix in 2000 and only increased by five per cent.
Experts say that now there are signs of online sales balance, since the last data showed only seven per cent increases during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth in the past years and return to 2000, they are always on an explanation," said Guardian Andy Malcahi, the IRMG sales editor.
He explained that online sales were activated three years ago when the purchasers started using their mobile phones to finish purchases.
This means that more people had the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do this under any conditions, for example, sitting on the divan.
But now it comes out on the plate, and you can see a decrease (creasing).
The Femen of Black Friday, coming from America, is mentioned as one of the causes of slow sales.
Experts believe that the purchasers could be able to avoid buying an event on the last Friday of November.
Last year, the purchasers were five times more rapid to computers to take advantage of advantaged proposals in order to cover the same number of sales sites.
Experts believe that the Black Friday, when the purchasers entered into the current battle for the benefits of the purchases, could make people stay away from the shopping
According to the investigation of the British Retail Consortium, at least one pound of sterlings from each 5 is online.
As a result of goods such as televisions and machines, more than one third is sold via the Internet stores.
At the same time, more than four people purchase clothes and rubber on the Internet on more than at the centre stores.

Consequently, Kingfisher plans to open 200 other Screwfix stores, specialised on the goods for the masters, and at the same time closed 60 B&Q stores.
Mrs. Laurie Rass, I would like to see more women in the form of B&Q magazines, since eight of the ten decisions on the purchase in the magazine are taken by representatives of the sex.
Now most of the staff are men.
It states that it does not not note the recent demographic trends that characterize the number of households consisting of single women who are more occupied by their dwellings than in the past.
Mrs. Laurie said, "Our stores still work primarily.
We need to take steps to achieve the balance.
In general, half of our customers constitutes women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the goods obtained are taken to women.
Women play a great role in making decisions.
Mrs. Lori, one of the five women in the role of British leading companies, whose actions are taken into account in the FTSE100 Index, also changed the composition of the top-administrators team, with the same number of men and women directors.
Kingfisher is not almost the only company in which 50 per cent of women's managers, including the general and financial director.
Mrs. Laurie said, "This was a comprehensive decision, and the divergence is an important question for us.
Finding appropriate women in the Directors' Board was unfortunate.
After the group took the expenditure for the closing of the stores, Kingfisher was decreased and the sale amounts were decreased for a half year.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, owned by Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new stores
Duration of the decision on the rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The world observes the Federal Reserve Bank held meetings, discussing the most important decision within two days, to raise or not the percentage rate for the first time in the last decade.
The question of 80 economys carried out in Re§s has found that almost half of those who believed that the Federal Reserve on this point last week now believed that it would still take time and maintain the rates at the current range of 0 to 0.25 per cent.
This is a story of the event since seven years since the Federal Reserve has decreased the rate to zero.
For the first time, we agree that the main bank can move with zero notes and start the process of normalization of percentage rates," said Anhel Morde, the leader of the International Economy Institute of Peterson.
The United States economy works effectively, the economic amount adds three million dollars to the balance report, and the inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision affects the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared for changes, but it is all about their confidence that all chances were against that step.
The decision will be declared at 20:00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: Refugees go through Croatia to the EU.
"Open!", a hundred of refugees scanned at the control-transport point of Horgosh at the Serbian-Hungrian border.
From Tuesday, Budapest overflowed the border for the movers.
Refugee seekers have already started to make other route routes easier.
One of them is located through Romania in a closed border with Serbia.
Another is through Croatia and Slovenia in Austria.
According to some data, buses that carry refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now moved to the city of Shidu at Croatia.
The drivers received the authority to follow without remaining.
The Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs of Nebosh Stepanovich assures that his country is doing everything to help refugees, but its opportunities are:
Our work is to ensure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to ensure humanitarian attitude towards them.
But this is already a general problem.
It is not easy to resolve, no country in the same way will be done, and yet a smaller country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But the Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is unprecedented:
If someone is called a refuge in Serbia, he must fill the documents for this.
And if he doesn't, they will not leave it in the country because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already brought 175 miles [175 km] to the border with Serbia.
But the Orban is not to remain on it: it is planning to make the same relief at the border of Romania.
Buharest has already stated that it is incompatible with the principles of Peace.
Wangelis Me ́rakis: "Eve wants to help us."
Wangelis Me ́rakis has been entitled to the right of the Governments of the Governments, which, in view of the Lefts, to the financial crisis.
Now he, being a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, rejects the call of Cyprus.
In a few days before election, he met the journalist.
Mr. Rakis, welcome to the Ronous!
Wangelis Me ́rakis: Thank you for the invitation.
For nine months ago, your party has suffered a disturbing damage by coalition of the SIRIZA, but now, on the question, "New Democracy" has been compared to it by popularity.
What has changed for that time?
Wangelis Me ́rakis: Greece changed, and we too.
Mr. Cyprus lyed much in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had the budget and economic growth.
Now the country has again a budget deficit and a high level without a deficiency.
The investors went away because Mr. Cyprus was missing them.
In the last nine months, the Greek had the opportunity to evaluate the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Cyprus.
And now they can easily compare what was promised to what was actually happened.
The whole life has become much worse than January when the situation has improved, and most of the Greek citizens have lost it.
Ironius: But you say that if you're taking a choice, you'll strive to associate with other parties, including SIRIZ.
Wangelis Me ́rakis: The fact that, as we realized in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is not accidentally that in all other countries where or still there are salvation programmes, political forces and all Governing Parties were gathered together to implement the programme they agreed without rejecting their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I strongly believe that at the current stage only political forces and institutions will allow the country to go forward.
Ironius: Your party has voted in support of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new Prime Minister on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or will you try to change it at least in part?
Wangelis Me ́rakis: Actually we vote for the movement of Greece on Peeis, because we well imagine the losing effects of the country's outcome from the EU.
Now it helps us by providing subsidy to our farmers for their production, we have solidarity funds, Unker packages and aid in the banking sector.
All of this would be lost if there was no agreement with it.
However, the current measures have become the result of Mr. Cyprus' negotiations.
I know that it doesn't want us to be.
It wants to help us.
Thus, if the new Greek Government will see that during the first year, the authority wants to order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will for the implementation of the salvation programme, then I am sure that all the commitments adopted that can not be fulfilled because of recession may be again subject to negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be wrong to think that in the first year of the new agreement we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors because they expect the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their confidence, we must continue privateness, reforms and structural changes that have been made by continuing to be the priorities of the EU and great investment opportunities that we have to open for better understanding and cooperation.
Unfortunately, during negotiations, the Government of Cyprus had no serious arguments on many key political issues that we discovered by discussing these issues with our colleagues.
I can bring an example of the income of farmers.
We explained to our partners that it was not about a fixed monthly income, and that it could not be fully charged before.
We were told that the ministers of Cyprus never talked about it.
I mean, Greek ministers were not prepared and wrongly informed, so negotiated and concluded an insufficient agreement.
Ironius: If you win the elections, it will soon be on one table with Mr. Unker, Holland, Mr. Mercel and other leaders of Peeis.
Will it be different from what your preacher Antonis Samaras said to them?
Wangelis Me ́rakis: First, I will explain to them that we were trying to make the 2012 agreement best until the end of 2014, in order to deal with the aggressive angles therein.
We moved forward reforms.
Of course, we did not have enough decisions and speeds, but we were in extreme circumstances.
The market has fallen, and there was no evidence of potential purchasers prepared to pay the price of the Greek Government.
At that time, I was a member of the parliament, and I was able to view three Parliament groups, which then constituted a government majority.
Despite their serious ideological disputes on key legislation projects, we had a working Parliament, which was in the presence of peoples and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations, outside.
And we have been able to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process was not interrupted by the general elections resulting from the presidential elections in December.
́Ronius: The last weeks in Greece have moved a mass flow of refugees.
What are you thinking about this situation, and the response of the countries in which these people are seeking?
Wangelis Me ́rakis: The crisis with refugees is a slow action bomb with which we must have a business after victory on elections.
And the reason is that the Government of Syria was not in this situation as follows.
Such questions should be discussed because, if the problem reaches you, there are only emergency measures.
And now we're in such a situation.
Even the temporary government that changed the SIRIZ has done more in seven days than Mr. Cyprus has made in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the temporary government, which provides a valuable assistance to the president of the rep, who invited the EU to conduct the same, will allow to find a decision.
We need to see how many refugees are to leave the country, and note that the refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of war in Syria, the victims of some extreme events that occurred with them.
This is a deep humanitarian issue, and we will be able to maintain the position that Pekah policies should adopt in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the same EU and should be taken into the United Nations.
We also need a better coordination of refugees, more efficient border control and refuge centres.
We should also effectively use the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this extreme problem.
Mr. Medakis, thank you for the interview.
Wangelis Me ́rakis: Thank you.

A man who opened a shot at the Dellta University left a note of excuses
After the shooting and murder of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note that he said he would "repeat" about the first murder and would like "all return" reported by the competent authorities on Tuesday.
The police in Gothie, Mississippi, reports that the teacher of geographical and public science at Delta's University called 911 approximately 10 hours tomorrow.
On Monday and told him he had shot someone.
Lamb said to the director that the police needed to send people home to him.
He reported, "I killed my wife yesterday evening," and he also mentioned that there was a "peak" in the house, which "no one's crazy" but probably disappointed.
The police was interested in the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shot.
When the police arrived in the crime place, the body of Emmy Prentis, 41, and a record from Lamba, 45 years of age, was said: "I'm sorry I would like to return all back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb passed 300 miles to the University of Delta, where it killed Ethan Schmidt, the historian teacher, and on Monday evening when the police surrounded him, he ended with himself.
The director of the University of William Laforge reported that he had no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamba was apparently in mind."
Despite the information made on Monday that Lamb had a role between Prentiss and Schmidt, the service offices reported " absence of any information or evidence of the " loving triangle".
Prentiss was a "good man" Shawn O'Stin, who told her that he was married about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin told him that he and Prentiss had a daughter whose 19th, and that she's "insolent".
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "better friends".
According to Lindsey Noules, the newspaper "San Gerald" calls a close friend of Prentis, then worked from home via the Internet.
Noulz Rass that Prentis had about the Laytney's dog's pressure and that she met Lamb about three years.
Noulz said, " she always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called the family at a time on Monday to say, "It doesn't eat."
On the same night, when the police reached him at the "1" near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, sprang out of it, fled into the forest, and shot there.
According to the summary located at the University site, Lamb received the degree of the doctor in the field of pedagogic science at the University of Delta at Wednesday 2015.
Stars Losing Your Happiness
Actor (left), on a graphy with his son Redmond (right), has experienced a few difficult years.
In 2001 he was with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his multi-yearly partnership with Farru Fosset, who died from cancer.
As reported, the actor also suffered from drug dependency, and in 2008 he was arrested for the protection of drugs.
All of this, of course, played his role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United has expired for a few months because of a double break
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champion Liga, in which Manchester United lost PSV in Endhovena.
While the protector is concerned about this behaviour that will not be able to go to the field for at least six months, Louis van Gall hopes that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
Trauma occurred during Hector Moreno's unfair pool at the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw walked in the PSV street.
He was helped in the field for nine minutes and gave oxygen before transporting to the hospital.
Van Gall said, "He has a double break, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or day later, and then they'll operate.
It's terrible - a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcoming great difficulties and playing tastically, and this happened.
There was a oxygen mask on it.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double break, it's six months, and the guy can't play in a group stage.
I hope he'll be able to play again in this season.
Moreno was lucky that he had not received a red card and was not assigned a tool.
Arbitr Nikola Ricoley didn't hurt me to the end.
Van Gall believes that the Italian judge has allowed a mistake.
You're thinking when I say it's worth the toolbars and the red card.
It was a very bad puzzle of two feet.
In your teacher Shaw writes, "Thank you all for your messages, not describe how I am devastated, my way to restore begins, I'll be back more rational than I was."
More on the subject: Manchester United is anxious of disaster with Luke Shaw in the game with PSV
The english protector will have an additional incentive to address Championat in France in June.
Philip Coku, PSV trainer, said, "This is a very hard trauma."
When any player faces such a trauma, they're all very disappointed.
It was never our players to traumaticly traumaticly.
Moreno moved his feet by playing for Me against the Netherlands team under the leadership of Van Gally on the World Championat in 2014.
"He's very hard now because he didn't have any chance to hurt the opposite, and when you hear that it's a very difficult trauma, you feel a bad thing," Coke said.
I didn't have the opportunity to see myself.
The only thing I could see is the ball that was flying in another direction, so it seemed like he touched him, but I didn't see the puzzle under Luke.
In the conversation with SBS6 Moreno said, "I know what this is, I know how difficult it is to overcome.
I'm very hard, and I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado from PSV was also delivered to the hospital after meeting Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know something else about "Lorax"?
Each parent takes one thing very quickly: if your child likes some book, take a little time before you get to know her nearly nazis.
Let's see if you're not David Cameron.
In response to the question of the representative of the company undertaken by the relief organisation in the canicle about its favorite book, the Prime Minister chose Lorax - a story with the environmental decline written by Dr. Sus in 1971.
This was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "This is a funny, touching, unusual story with a greedy message I like to read my comments because it always finds some picture or message we miss."
And it would be good, except the last paragraph in which Cameron, as it seems, refers to the contents of the book, but actually tells the unnamed film recorded in 2012, with new persons and details added to add a quickly short original report.
"In the surrounded high walls of the town of Universalville, where there was no green and even air sold for money, the boy named Ted hopes to overcome the heart of Odry - the girls of her mouth, when he wants to see the actual tree," we read in the text of the charity story, not the Dr. Suza (the current name Theodor Sus Gazel), dead in 1991.
If this looks insufficiently suspicious, Cameron's text is read almost as a short exhibition of the "Lorax" film comment, expressed on the Internet Movie Database site: "In the high walls of the city of Universalville, where everything was experienced and even air sold for money, the boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Odry - the girl of her ridicule."
It seems little likely that Cameron, by general recognizing an active parent, is so unknown to the contents of a book that is not called a boy, knows how it disturbs the surrounding wood exhaust and the binding "smoking" Nahadkins, despite the protests of Loracs (which name you are in the name of the book) is a smile with the mouths that "speaks on the name of the trees".
Probably, such an uncomfortable PR task was assigned to the artist who never read the book on Lorax 20 times.
The representative of Duwning-Strit stated that the text was previously received from the Cameron Office in the electoral area.
The SuperCamps firm confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron station but did not follow further comments.
For Adam Lita, it was obvious that the risk was not to fall into England, but this is still a complex issue
Victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a very simple task, but if you look at the collection that England has chosen for this tour, the repeat of the trial series of 3-0, which has occurred last time, I don't feel likely.
I wouldn't be able to exclude the victory in my field.
Alister Kuka's command may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are players, virtually taking rubbers and collective thoughts; they will not be brought with them a scars from 2012 but only a younger position.
With Moen Ali's ball, it is converted into a bowler that gives a covered bottle, and Adyl Rashid, even if it is not a test level figure, is an attacking option.
More topic: Adam Lit was exited from the assembly of England on test cricket and replaced by Alex Hills
A decision on Adam Lita's exception to me, his main trainer in Yorkshire, is difficult to analyze.
Two good attacks were made on his seven test catches in complex conditions, and evident, but cruel reality was that the cricket players were evaluated by judges.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, that led to that statement, because (and I said it before) players are best choosing themselves.
A couple is half a hundred, and Lita could wait for a longer career, but he was in the power of his own judgment.
We hope that if he has more hurt for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The Master Collector of England, Trevor Baileis, was well talking about his attitude, even when he did not do what he could, and it won't hurt me; he's first the commander, and then all the rest.
The question of how long it is before the test cricket bears an impression on itself is a complex issue.
Lit played seven games, like Robson before him, and Nick Compton is at nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and outside field.
The only thing you could be pleased is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier Liga when Lit was in the best form, but this lost opportunity is already in the past.
Alex Hayes appears, and he's a bathsman I'm highly appreciating.
He's an unpredictable cricketist that we saw in the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season when he had 236 in a cat against us at the Trenth Bridge area, which was already something.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as those before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composite of the team in the AEA.
The idea of putting Mona near Cook as an open bathman, that would give the possibility to introduce an additional spinner by keeping four speed bowlers, is thinking, and I'm not in the opposite.
I don't see the reasons why the player can't take a ball there, but this leftman has already shown that he's a fucking good cricketist.
Moan may not be exactly what he needs for his Woostershire, but it's the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old companion by the team of Justin Langer played his first 38 test cats "third Betsman" before he went out as an opening in 2001.
He wined three hundred and didn't shoot.
Zafar Ansari is coming into the collection as a reserve spinner, and in my uncontinued community he showed me a very promised young man.
People can look at his exemplary statistics - in average 31 bits and 35 meters - and think that it is a riskable rate, but among the snucks that vote "for" a little, and the electors have chosen youth.
He'll learn much in this tour.
In addition to the collection, England is planning to make a couple of training supplements.
The designation of Mahela Jawordine, a Sri Lankin Batsman, as a consulent for test catches, could be a mastership.
He is one of the best guys for the game that will bring the richest experience that has been received under all conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where a white bottle is used, and is enhanced by both energy and unprofit temperature in the setape.
I always felt that he was born to be endeavored to the international cricket, whether game or training, and, as Mah, he has a great intellectual.
Sometimes new votes in the division, even if they say what has been said earlier, can add new powers to the team.
College Colly on the Darham Ben Stoux team has been left for single-daily, Ruth has been given an analogue break in relation to Australia, and I, for example, do not experience the problem of this behavior.
Although not all of this, the trainers and the players who choose players do not determine the schedule.
And you must remember how players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easily taken.
The UK outcome camp could win if the economy is in depression until 2017
David Cameron's non-production policy on the renewal of British negotiations in the EU each day tests more complex, even without regard to the election of the geneal Jeremy, "Is it not?" - Corbine by the Leaborist leader or TUC's behaviour on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbines and Naigels Faradji.
The Companional Diplom of Peece explained at the days that, in the position in which the EU is currently involving various crisiss - not all of them - some of the countries-participants of the British Ego-Agenda Seeds - were deteriorating and deteriorating agreements of changes that they would not generally want.
When meeting in Briton at an annual meeting, TUC decided that he wouldn't want them anyway if they disrupted protection.
We could even call that "the Dave and George's program".
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are chatted at the meetings and two-side sessions at foreign hundreds, graphed themselves at the background of the memory, in the company's property or without, then come home and say that they have attached allocations to reform.
It's all about me.
My friend of Pee, who wants to be interested in maintaining the external contacts in Britain under the tent of Rose, "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin, "which is that the guarded ministers and offices have come to understand when they're still, we'll stay or leave.
Angle: Mercel, a totally eight-year German officer, is an alien, but she is 10-year-old officer and wants to leave the office before the situation is deteriorated, as it has been deteriorated on her Tetcher (11-years), Mitterran (14) and Cola (16).
The Chapter of France France, France Holland, stands before or replaced in 2017.
He's losing power too.
Poland can get nationalists to the right government, and Spain to the left.
It is hard to see those out of the skin to help the "self-British" whose energy could be affected by preventing Scotland's output from UK - what they do not want, because most have similar separatist trends.
So some of these ministers can even plan the issue of an injury in the SNP style during the United Kingdom reference campaign in 2017 in order to improve the outcome process of the United Kingdom from the EU, I guess my friend.
"Review was the idea-fix" and "Brittannium has not received anything valuable from the renewal of negotiations."
They know who Flit Street could be, and how skeptically medianates are set up to the EU, regardless of the time of Tony Bennham Referencement in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973, related to 2:8.
They may be proud to remember Boris Johnson, a rained portfolio, who praised his "free bananas" by the Brussels Correspondent at beginning 90 C.E.
At all his foolishness, Ed Milliband knew who was his enemies.
They included a petroleum company from the fearful taxes of juices, phone hackers and psycho-no residents who possess most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was the same opinion about them, but he reported himself that when you're in a cell with a big gorilla, you should give her the bananas so that you can't eat you on a coat and the tea again.
In fact, Millibend was a greater committee of Blair than Blair himself in the opposite of Cameron's idea of reference, since Blair was acting in favour of the cancelled EU constitution, buried by French and the Netherlands electors in 2005, who gave him a winner ticket.
The press did not forgive him any of this.
But my dear Jeremy Corbin, who friendly shook me in the westminster sword on Monday, I told him that he had no time to lose it on me -- it seems like it's risking to repeat Neal Kinock's "Merdock's boat" from the 80s -- a mistake and then, and now.
This may take time, but he must take up the impact of the interaction with the press, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose ship in the WTO he was sitting on Sunday.
The official position of Corbine on the face is that I delicately call evolution.
He says that he wants us to stay in the reformed EU.
In fact, most of the people under the traditional trends of Ukip and the larger "small England sides" among the two may probably say "yes".
It's the same thing as Hillari Benn said on the radio and TV on this week, and his internal battlet refused to confess that the Destination of the Corbine of John Donnella was a bad idea to the "Thank" Financial Minister.
It was about 70 years when his older father of all forces was on TV for unloyalty to colleagues on the Leaborist office, without going too far and losing his post in the office of ministers.
The Hillary bit was more attractive.
But the fight for staying "in any circumstances" is Benna's phrase, not what Donnel said, and not what J. K. spoke to the couples and members of the parliament at the private meeting on Monday evening, in general.
In order to communicate the democracy and his "man" Corbin there, remember, he even tried me -- the discipline of messages remains important in the 7th century of the television seven days a week, especially in the airport of the networks, the paranoia and the prevention.
This is not to give KÃ©ron so simple to take away from it, allowing him to accept as a positive support for the leaborists during the referendum campaign, as Donnel said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
However, the main distortion of Donnel and Corbine on the conduct of the membership in the EU -- in the "bennite" economy of the seeded force -- is no longer the issue of the exoter of discussion between the left-hand dissidents, for which narcissism, born to a small decline, is a central principle in dogmatics.
The fact that Nato-Tom Watson's mistakes is incompatible with the fact that J.K. would not agitate for the outcome - foreign diplomats will be able to try to bring it to their own own own owners.
Why would Paris or Berlin treat a political capital - they also have a suspicious suspicion - to British attacks when it can be insensitive?
The United States are already disappointed by the military actions of British people in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the Government of the Authority has cut off the expenditure I have been made on Monday during the band on a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
The statements of the Government of the Agency that electronic cigarettes are less than smoking were sent to 12 people at meeting, some of which are with the tabacco industry, as reported by researchers.
Experts in British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet discovered the evidence of the performance used by the Public Health England Agency in their electronic cigarette report.
The PHE op had a significant report - the "return thing" in the past month, called it "total exam of evidence".
However, some researchers doubted the validity of data and showed that some experts were associated with the tabacco industry.
In the editing article in the medical magazine Lancet, the previous month was decreased by the " extremely picking evidence" that the PHE had built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers questioned whether these statements are "fast or fair".
MartinKi, the teacher of the Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Trop of Medicine, and Simon Kappwell, teacher of Epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: "The basic principle of health should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
According to them, the public expects the PHE statements that "the current best" shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less than the tabacocurrence" to be evidence and modeled on a rational basis.
In fact, this is from the only meeting of 12 people, which has been gathered for a multicriterial analysis of decisions to gather their opinions on the product that has different non-tinocontaining products; the results of the meetings are shortly carried out in scientific investigation.
Kee and Capwell reported that one of the assembly sponsors was a company named Euroswiss Health, which was reported to the Director-General that he had already received an independent investigation from British American Tobacco.
He also confirmed the BAT certificates in the field of health care in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 persons at the meeting announced that the electronic cigarette manufacturer had been informed without mentioning that he had received from the tabacco company Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation of the members of the Council, but there are several electronic cigarette parties, some of whom also stated that the industry was implied in the P.I.
It is not possible that other participants have experiences of management in the Tabacco.
The meeting was also visited by the Tabacco holder in the PHE.
The Scientific article "contracted by the group" with the lack of "the famous evidence of the effects of most of the products by majority of the criteria" wrote.
However, any of these links and initiatives were included in the PHE report.
KY and Capwell reported that the PHE statements were "not evident at present that electronic cigarettes are the way that leads children or non-running to smoke," I have been preliminary.
Professor Kevin Fenton, who was a health and well-being holder in the PHE, told that the BMJ statements had already been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are less than tabacocurrence."
One of the two smokes died throughout the life of his passion.
All evidence of the existence under the fact that the health threats to electronic cigarettes are comparatively small, but we must continue to examine remote consequences.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform publicly of what they prove and what they do not prove, especially where there were doubts about the behavior of the dangers compared to the tabac.
About 80,000 people die every year from the diseases of smoking, and smoking is 2 billion pounds per year.
Clearly indicating that although electronic cigarettes and I are not safe, they are only part of the fumable part, we are carrying out our tasks before the nation.
Ancient Chapter 4 of Channel 4 believes that BBC should stop the EastEnders series
The former Chapter of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop the issue of programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would have given many of them for successful shows such as the "Albert Placement".
Johnson noted that license collections should only be used for the creation of programmes that are not released by other British television companies.
He expressed the BBC criticism because the company puts the transmission of public meetings, which is probably only a small part of the audience, for a pick-up time when competitors have a high review show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the Director-General BBC Tony Hall said that the corporation would want to cooperate more with others, Johnson noted that he had failed to work with BBC during six years during the work of Channel 4.
"I can't think that BBC will prepare and translate transfers that could show competitive companies without subsidy," Johnson told members of the Committee on Communications of the Lord's Palace in the context of the interpretation of the BBC's further judgment.
If you keep a license collection that I don't consider a good decision in the average and long-term period, the company should leave only those programs that are not released and are not going to be released by other companies.
The Voice Shaw goes out to the epher in the praim-slot, because creators want to receive the maximum support for the future.
The idea that no one will have it anymore, is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; generally they are their own production.
Other channels, of course, would have given a lot for it.
I don't understand how this can be a public event.
I don't think that would somehow reduce BBC.
The serial undertaking of Johnson, who is headed by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC to follow the ratings "from both of them and because of their faith that this is the best way to receive support for the time."
His comments on the most popular show on the BBC are addressed with the comments of the Executive Director Sky Tony Bolla, who, in his memory lecture, offered the BBC to sell series of EastEnders in 2003.
Johnson noted that the more lower transmissions of the BBC "continue going to BBC4, where often it is to evaluate the audit, but therefore the company's function has been carried out, and that can be reported as an argument in the Canadian preachers that justifie the income from license collections at 4 billion pounds: "No, of course, we do all these unintelligent transfers that no one does."
They're putting them in a shop where no one's gonna look at them.
As a result of the license collection, Johnson reported to the Committee more: "I call you to find a more regressive system in the cashing, who most of it will receive.
Of course, you're all thinking we all think that 150 pounds per year are a great amount, but for people whose 150 pounds are large money, I'm interested, they think so because they don't look very and listen to BBC.
The former Executive Director of the Sky and Channel 5 channels, David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee on the last Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission for "inform, broadcast and enjoy".
He noted that only a small part of the BBC issued materials is formally classified as you are educated - according to it, it is 1% of the television and 0.1 per cent of the radio - and that the company should take the initiative of the Australian and Canadian visiting companies under the nine "inform, broadcast, and enjoy".
On the issue of the partnership, Elstein noted that the BBC should apply more efforts in such areas as the "Amend Concerts" (only part of them, according to its statement, is on TV) and to join the negotiations with commercial consultative companies in order to make them available for online review.
"Sonogenetic" allows brain cells to be managed using sound walls
The video role shows how noise change the movement at the moment when they are affected by sound impulses.
The scientists have made red with a genetically modified nervous system that can be managed using sound walls.
Small insights change the direction of movement at the time they are affected by sound impulses, too high to hear the ear.
Impulses are effective through the activation of neurons, genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More topics: Researchers manage brain activities through light
Scientists reported that reds demonstrate the possibility of a new method called "sonogenetic", which includes the use of ultrasounds to excite certain brain cells, hearts and mouse cells, and there is a source of ultrasounds outside the body.
Sricant Chalassani, scientist at the So, La Hoya, California, told Guardan that this method could once replace the deep stimulation of the brain - an invasive procedure in which electric impulses are sent to human brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
Red-nematodes usually do not respond to ultrasounds, but Chalassani discovered that they began to respond when they were placed in the weight containing microscopic puzzles.
He discovered that the puzzles strengthen ultrasound whales that then get into red organism.
Increased ultrasound whales affect the structures called "yon TRP-4 channels" found in some red cells.
Ultra-sound whales make these channels open and encourage cells that are with them, reported in Nature Communications.
In order to create none of the elements that can be managed through ultrasound, Kalassani made genetic modes of red, so their mobile neurons are isopo; TRP-4 channels.
During the use of ultrasounds for the effects of modified organs, sound waves increased by microscopic puzzles and were incorporated into red bodies by enabling modified neuro motors.
This methodology is similar to the "optogenetic" which allows scientists to include and disable neurons with light impulses.
Chalassani states that, in comparison with this method of sonogenetics, some advantages may have.
In contrast to the light that is sufficient to the necessary part of the broadcast brain, low-frequent ultrasound waves are without prejudice through the body's weights, so they do not need to pass inside the steel box.
"We believe that the use of genetherapy and therapeutic viruses will be used to treat some neurological diseases under clinical conditions, during making neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal, " said Chalassani.
He added that the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

They thought to create a more significant and hitroum corporative advertising, but "filling her house with light flowers and animations has become more impressive."
"They have unbelievingly helped us with the attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment on exhibition," said Tom Davis from Amnesty.
Now we need the Government of Great Britain to take measures and guarantee that this torture equipment will not be sold directly at our time.

Eight gold rules of residence in students
For 11 years since I moved to the school community as a normal 19-year-old man who still believed in morality and morality, but now I just remember the laughing of those I've disappointed - and many, long complaints on others.
In principle, what I learned can be distributed by eight simple rules.
The movement to the community can be broken from the low to the low to the absolutely scared.
He urges people to talk: tell people from where you took an academic department and where you made it, whether you support Corbin and why you "really, I love, or I hate Marmate" because, seriously, it's just a hard extract of Hahahahaha, I'll be with myself."
Shut up.
And help others to relax - ask questions and demonstrate interests.
This supports you and helps you find people whom you like, not those with whom you would not even speak, even if you had burned the cups, and they would have split the firemakers.
Let people have a space.
People are often converted into drinking, semi-films and places of common boxes, but they are also the place where people dress and fix the whites below.

Introverts at universities are unfair.
Your horse must be a refuge, but many communities form a culture of sharing from one camel to another, which contributes to friendship, society and to friendships.
This may be a hell for a person who trys to restore powers.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep coming with you, but I need you to leave, and I got to restore the energy I had been spent to communicate with you."
Try to feel when the companion is deceived by the community, not to join him, but to send SMSs.
In fact, you're doing this.
One guy in my community followed the following principle: If the door was not closed, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.

Since you're starting a university life on the population of Bake-Off show, you're going to shoot in the door to people to keep up and submit a chocolate song, it's no wonder, it's not like that in the 1950's reminder of them, "Welcome, we're neighbors, I've got something out of you, and now smile, and I'll give you similar questions."
It's a good way to get friends.
The neighbors will feel that they have to talk to you, and then your face will probably be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are.
The ill-blind muck, sugar and grass will cause people to be sleeping when you're going to get to them.
Eating is a typical crime in students.
Of course, the adoption of some kitchen is stealing, but is it a worm to take a little bit of milk for the tea?
Right with the owner of milk.
He's probably going to suggest you not to be disappointed, even if it's inside.
If someone breaks your things, it hurts you, and I'll feel you, but try to take it to the adulter than my neighbor who puts it in his milk for the wheat, to recompense those who took him without a question.
Now she'll be in.
You don't have to make a sound that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a good person, but also because you are the same people in the talk about glassed houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to add the sound of the barban and the bas-gitar, because there were three hours in the morning, and she had an exam tomorrow.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he was quiet at 5 a.m., she was allowed to sleep two hours and then locked her door after herself and sent her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband would sit in the same company as you?
Instead, would it not be extremely, before the cup of locks, inevitably if you accepted the neighbor for your future wife, took them away, swallowed them and should see him every day, and maybe see how he moves all your common friends to his side?
Of course, you're not going to tell the sheriff, but if the warm neighbor is exactly not your future husband, try to cold your own powder.

iOS 9: how to install a new iPhone operational system after Apple is released
A new operational system can be invited by selecting the General and then - Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to spring and install it.
Problems were faced after the installation when an error report was reported that they said " Renewment of the Annex failed."
In order to avoid this, users are recommended to wait until they are quiet or trying to renew via iTunes.
The phone suggestions allow you to go through the whole process until the end.
The process may include the elimination of applications to enhance the free space, but Apple is a minimum of the probability of this action by decreasing the size of the update, and has also facilitated the implementation of a special tool that will allow the application to be removed and reinstalled after the process is completed.
It is necessary to make sure that your phone is loaded or is located near the loading device so that the battery is not allowed.
If the load is too low, Apple will stop updating because the phone class in the process can lead to upgrade.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by phone.
The United States Secretary John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
He believed that the military support, which Moscow provides to President Asade, was only to enhance the conflict.
At the same time, the Chapter of White House is going to talk to the Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
The United States Secretary John Kerry called the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia Sergei Lavrov to discuss the military activity of Russia in Syria.
This is reported from PJ Media.
"The Secretary Carry clearly understands that the further support of President Asad from Russia is the risk of disturbing and prolonging the conflict, and is negative to our general goal - the fight against extremism - if we also do not continue to seek the ways of the Syrian conflict by direct transmission of authority," said the representatives of the United States Department.
They also noted that Kerry had once highlighted the commitment of the United States to combat the " Islam State " in coalition from more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Asad would never be a member of her.
Furthermore, the United States "will be pleased with Russia's active role in trying to resist the "Islam State".
On the last Friday, the representatives of the White House said that they did not know exactly what the Russian army in Syria did, but Washington was going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, the press secretary of the White House J. Ernest noted that the time for the phone between the President of the United States Barack Obama and the Russian leader Vladimir Putinim was not yet saying, "When the president decides that the phone with the President Putian is for the benefit of our interests, he will raise the trumpet and try to make this call."
Barak Obama himself considers Russian decision to increase the support of Asa's regime as a "proliferant rate".
I remember our with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that the further support of Asad would only deteriorate the situation.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and as a result of the situation," said the President of the United States.
The imported jackets will be released from the payment of the rental.
Mineconomised development is temporarily free of importable jackets and other floating means for rest and payment of taxes and taxes.
The relevant changes in the range of goods for temporary free imports were prepared by the Ministry of the Government of the FE.
The "Reports" reported this by the Minister for Economic Development of Elena Laskin.
In June 2015, Prime Minister RF Dmitriy Medvedev for the outcome of the road in Cryme ordered a series of conferences - Mineconstruction, Mineconduct, Middle RF, Minculture, MID, MSC, FSB, FTS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals for the establishment of a pleasant shipment in the neighbouring areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the full absence of infrastructure for guarding, service and ice content.
The governments prefer to keep their courts outside the border - approximately $200 million each year for the preservation, reparation and service of ice.
Russia's Mineconomen Development prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Asian Economic Commission " To introduce changes to the Record of the goods which are temporarily imported with full-conditional freedom from payment of taxes, taxes for repairs and other floating reliefs.
According to the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favourable iatin development in the neighboring areas of the country, says Laskin.
The question was addressed to consider the subcommission on the tax tariff, non-arithmical regulation, protective measures in the external trade of the Governing Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which had been held in September, and was also approved by awareness after the outcome of the discussion.
As noted by the representative of the Minecon-Environment, the measures proposed for full-conditional freedom of imports are in fact a loan.
Therefore, after the Protocol of the Subcommission Meeting in the Government of the Russian Federation of Mineconduct, the Mineconduct will propose a proposal to the Asian Economic Commission for the discussion with the EFTA Member States, Laskin explained.
The list of importable goods that are fully released from the payment of taxes, taxes includes the goods that contribute to external activity and international cooperation, to the use in the field of science, culture, cinematography, and tourism, to provide international assistance, and to the doctors.
In the press service of Mintrans RF, the " Reports" reported that the commitment was prepared on the sea ports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Julta, Pheodosia and Patrio, which provides a simplified order for the west and the outcome of small, patrol and transitional vessels at the seaport.
The Centre has given the mandate to the capitals of the Crime Seaports to ensure the application of a simplified west of small, pairy and passed vessels at the sea port and the outcome of the sea port.
The Centres also prepared projects of the RF Government on the border of the Crime Seaport Aquatory.
As regards Jalta and Pheodose, the rest of the divisions have already been adopted and are at the stage of consciousness, noted in the press service.
According to the Mintrans, the host, the class and the witnessing, the host of the minor vessels used for non-Comercial purposes, the Republic of Krym and Sevastopol should be concerned.
The problem is that in Russia it was extremely difficult to join just because of developed infrastructure.
If you look at South Italy and France, there is a whole permanent development industry in which a large number of people are affected.
In Russia, everything is actually worth it.
Our small-interessable, only piece in which you can exploit jackets is the Black Sea in the region of Sochi, Helenjika, Norwegian, Ana.
But greater difficulty is that there are extremely strict rules of border service in this area: to get out of the jacket, the mass of authorisations must be made.
Moreover, inside Russia, the jack is even somewhere to go.
Two days she can go with her fuel and then get the problem to take it, says the Nordmarine Denis Novikov's sales director.
As a result of the shipment, there are now special ships in Moscow and Saint-Peterburg to be held up to 30 m. The ships are also sent to guard to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that the buyers of jackets were rich people, but after the beginning of the crisis, the question was decreased.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine $500 million credits.
The World Bank approved a new interest project for Ukraine in $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service to the international organization.
"The new development will support a number of priorities to reform in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," says the report.
The Director of the World Bank on Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Zimao Fan, stated that the reforms of the banking sector would help re-economic credits and will stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that Ukrainian authorities had adopted impressive steps in the reform of the economic and the World Bank.
However, because of the serious problem of Fan, the Government of Ukraine calls for reform.
Previously, the Polish Government approved the delivery of a credit in $100 million in Ukraine, transmitting the " RIA News".
It is requested to create blocks for transgenders from there.
On the Community Council at the Federal Office of Penalty (FSIN) on the Protection of the Rights sentenced in October 2015, including other issues, will discuss the possibility of creating transgender and transmission blocks.
The "Reports" related to this member of the Vladislav Grib Council.
It considers that, depending on the total number of convicted in Russia, no extent of gender is possible to provide from where the cameras, blocks, or even (if there is much such criminals) for transsexual speciality.
However, Vladislav Gryb emphasises that determining that the penalty of citizens in such isolated places is possible only after the convictions of the relevant medical experts that prove that the criminal is actually a person who identifys himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Gryb assured that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the security of punishment.
According to his statement, the decree is successful: the SISO (where the accused are before the decision of the court) is provided by the cameras for transgenders and in the correctional institutions are special blocks.
This is the only outcome today with such criminals.
They must be exclusively isolated, since the presence of transittors and transgenders in normal cameras is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and sea problems for FSINs.
The reduction of the trading by the cameras is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
On the basis of the great city, the number of criminals with an undetermined sex, it is necessary to calculate where to distribute them.
SIZO does not really need only cameras and blocks.
Yes, a separate existence is if there's a lot of transgenders.
As Gryb explained, the block may contain 50 or 100 persons, and if a specialized corner is created one in Russia, the penalty of prisoned transsexual figs from any region will be rejected.
Citizens are contained in the SISO on the consensus of crime, so the transit or transgender of other subjects in the course of investigation and judicial proceedings are inefficient, and there is a statement for those already condemned in the case of the Greb.
On the torture of legal protection bodies, it was not able to decide in which a follow-up isolator is men or women to determine the detained for the preservation of drugs of 24-year-old Dmitria Cošukov (Alina Davis), which was not arrested by a man with a girl's appearance.
He was released home under a signature of the unusual.
This news was broadly discussed in networks and MMEs, since the transgender content mechanism in SISO and Russia is not yet.
The Russian Legal Protector, LGBT movement activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual) Nicolai Alexander supported the idea of creating special persons to be punished by transgenders, noted that there was also a possibility for the definition of men or women, depending on their own desires.
With regard to the atmosphere in Russia, the proposal is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists as well as the security issue for homosexuals, says Alexander.
The prisons should be safe, therefore, where the blocks could be made on behalf of this and for homosexualists, more than they were more than transgenders.
In addition, Alexandria doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who will be ready to be transexuals in order to enter into a different way from normality.
Of course, medical testimony can be introduced before placing people in transgenders, but it is not always the same.
For example, one of the prisoners in the United States looked like a man and already said that he wanted to change sex, " said Alexander.
A man can feel who is pleased.
But until there is no department to punish transgenders, I doubt that the people will consider the security of such people and avoid their rational or sexual identity.
At the same time, a reproductive health expert on the RF Boriss Lordkipanide noted that introducing a new system of transsexual-criminal divisions in the area of the Criminal Divisions could deteriorate the beginning of the penalty to the convicted.
The Commission is aware that this is the issue of sexuality, psychiatrists are conducting observations, and it is not one test based on high-accurate conclusions.
Today psychiatric opportunities allow it.
Therefore, before the change in sex potential, patients are always going through such expertise - they are exactly identified whether the exchange of sex with the surgical interaction is the necessary measure, says Lordkipanid.
However, it is difficult to make it difficult to introduce this system to the convicted, because in the meantime, this investigation is a month.
The doctor, despite the overall idea of the creation of transsexual blocks, also doubts that, in the current economic conditions, it would be appropriate to provide resources for building new places, medical experts, transgenders in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate that there is no official statistics, but if you consider that about 5 per cent of the homosexuals in Russia, the transgenders can be said to be less than those who have such rejection and commit crimes, it is a little number, said Lordkipanid.
Now before the administration of homosexualists, transgenders, and so can receive the conditions of content.
Michael Antipo won the Iorian world campaign on the shak.
The world campaigns in Hanty Mansiski have been completed in the midst of 20 years.
The end of the firstborn was more than intriguing.
The winner was only in the last tour, and the Russian Michail Antippo, who still was disappointing the Jana-Chistoph Dudu pool, which would like to go to the title.
The girls have won the Ukrainian shock of Nathana Bux.
The world campaigns of shachmates that passed from September in Hanty Mansiski already in the middle of the tourist distance seemed to have lost almost all the intriguing, since the representative of Poland Ian-Chistof Duda, who had a series of four trials (with the switzerland system in 13 tours), had certainly taken leadership.
Since Duda was a primary estimate-favorite, and it was considered one of the most promising young shoes, the probability that he would lose the obtained fractions was very little.
And even when Duda made the traffic and allowed the Russian Michael Antipo to reduce the delay to 0.5 baths, he remained a clear favor in the fight against the title.
For Antipo had to win in the 13th tour to reach the leader.
But it wouldn't even help you win Douda's party.
Moreover, this commitment of winning, of course, could be said to the Russian shock games and to bring to an obliged error.
Fortunately, Michael Antipo was able to escape them.
He was certain of Francesco Rabbaldi, after which he had to wait to finish his party with the Dud that had been met with Benjami Bok.
Happy for Antipo, the Polish Shak has been contrary to the Netherlands' neighborhood.
Thus, Antipo and Duda took the same number of weapons - 10 of 13, but Antipo was the best additional indicators.
That is why the leading of the Hanty-Mansie's outline surrounding, whose Governor Natalia Komarov, traditionally gives great attention to the development of the shachmat in the region, has given a major premium.
And this is not the case of the girls intriguing the end.
The tourist leader - Nathane Buxe (Ukraine) - was enough to lose the title in the last tour that she did with success.
Thus, the Russian Victory of Alina Bill did not allow her to hit Bux.
The Russian sportsmenge remained the second with the delay of the campaign at 0.5 balls.

The current year, an investigation of the Russian Manager Association " Top-1000 Russian managers" is 16 times.
As a tool for the professional reputation of Russian directors of the highest axelon, the study undermines the results of the work of Russian managers per year, determining leaders in adults and functional directions.
The initial puzzle of candidates consists of the laureats of the rating last year.
The winners of the past year will confirm their participation as a rating candidate of the current year and to move members of their Management Team.
Furthermore, each of the candidates involved in the original list will be moved to ten new managers of other companies, which would be appropriate to add to the general puzzle of candidates.
The company ' s functional directions may be removed: Financial Director, Commercial Director, Personal Director, IT Director, Public and Competitive Director, Authority Authority Director, Corporation Management Director.
Each of the experts proposed by the manager is invited to participate in the review and is given the opportunity to remove its management team and to ten new rues of other companies.
Approximate candidates under the growing principle are based on the Exploring Classificator of the Management Association: In-technology, commercial banks, forest and forest-pro-trade industry, machinery, media-basis, metalurgy, multiprofession, services, communication and telecommunications, consumer services, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceutics, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
A login and password are provided to each party to access the website www.top1000.amr.ru where they see information about the rest of the parties and they can provide their proposals for each functional direction.
The principle "The Best Choose Best" is based on the rating methodology: the top managers evaluate top managers, the functions of the managers evaluate functional managers.
The proper principle allows the maximum authenticity of the professional reputation of colleagues.
Finally, the results of the rating are approved at the meetings of expert committees.
At the meetings of expert committees, all the candidates in the current year and multi-fold review candidates have been invited.
The Commissions are organized on the functional basis: the Committee on the Superior Rules and Eight Commissions on the Rule of Functionary Guides.
At the meetings of the expert committees, it is possible to approve the alphabetically presented puzzles (the sites are maintained strictly on the Internet evaluation and I have been closed before the review) or to update their adjustments to the reserve candidates applied.
The names of the company are given in the Russian rules and " E" rules.
At the time of the rating, the status of managers and companies is changed.
The comfortable rate for investment is 10-13 per cent.
Experts evaluated that the Small and Medium Business credit market in January-April of the current year was 40 per cent.
What, according to your estimates, is the situation today?
After the end of 2014-2015, the amount of credit for SMEs was significantly decreased.
The reason is comprehensive: rare increase in percentages.
The credit under 25-30 per cent of the year was unfair to anyone.
If the bank could earlier put all its problems in the further, from time to time to time, it is not able to do: taxes and such clouds.
The current level of credit rate for business is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is not acceptable in view of their occupation.
The rate level of 10-13 per cent would allow business to invest in large projects and to form its eligibility.
How much, according to your estimates, is the question of the undertakers' credit?
After decreasing the rate of the NCB, the situation was a little improved.
Credit resources have become more available.
However, we observed that the customers were taking a lot of credits.
Firstly, business does not understand its development and future income.
Today, business has one outcome: it is necessary to learn to work by orienting on today's economic situation in the country and in the region.
The current results should be monitored more carefully and control the movement of the feedingstuffs.
At the same time, when financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to modernise equipment, reduce production and energy security costs.
All of this, finally, allows the company to make the production more competitive and to maintain business even in an instabil economic situation.
What major trends of the credit market will strengthen and affect its development until the end of 2015?
Will the rate change?
The prognoses of the reduction of the average rate in many will depend on the Central Bank's policy, and the regulator now demonstrates the consequences of the decrease of the rate.
However, a radical fall of the credit price for SMEs is not worth waiting.
In the present situation, the problem is, firstly, an inflation that makes the needed increased rate for the receipt of real income.
Furthermore, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even when the rate of CB is reduced.
In terms of time-limiting, the traditional small and medium-sized enterprises, which have been able to carry out monetary and economic behaviour options, will certainly be a major risk for creditors.
I wouldn't expect an annual reduction of the share of bad credits.
Basic reason is the sanctions and their negative impact on the economy of the country.
New Mazda CX-5 and a nice mode.
That is exactly what Mazda says by Japanese hieroglyphes.
Beautiful, laconic and simultaneously complex enough for those who have been used to cirillic or latin.
The new CX-5 crosshover, however, and any other pattern of the mark: without exciting attractive outside, technically consistent inside.
Japan has been simply in force of its "japanish" able to demonstrate the attachment to the products of the country's upcoming sun to the state of full obstacle.
How pleasant it may be to bring arguments to the use of cars from other countries, and even in principle, they will agree, but all the conversations will come from the final phrase: "But this is the Japanese car!
No matter what!
Such people probably should love not only the technology but also the other Japanese.
Citing with Base's walk, carrying wasaby food, collecting catastrophes and clothing your girlfriend is no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.......
Please, the Japanese school is the only one that the Japanese have been carrying with pleasure and after school.
It has wonderful properties: at the same time and emotional, and strong.
And what's older, it's a little bit.
The main change in the outside of CX-5 is a radiator residue with five horizontal lines.
But where it changes the form of the car with a new shape of far and back backgrounds, the car is currently known in the car river.
Like earlier, Mazda CX-5 looks very disappointed.
The syluet is harmonious, the forms are sensitive, but the outermost has a strike.
It won't be done to call the pool.
CX-5, one of the most safe worldwide, only a hundred Japanese calms can be tested.
The design engine of 2.2 l provides a high wrapping moment in a wide range of innovations.
The fuel cost of this engine with the power of 175 a.m. only 5.9 a.m. is compiled by the force aggregate exclusively automatically by transmission and full drive.
Black bottles, black bottle, black bottle...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can select a tip with a print from the police feet No Cross.
In Mazda, however, they have made the effort that you do not have the CX-5 role of your own DTP.
In order to increase the comfort by maintaining a great governance, the coverage of the front and back aborts and the optimism of the plug-in of the foreheads.
The full drive system is adjusted under Russian conditions.
The high speed of the road and the engine has been decreased by 13 per cent.
The buyer in a flower or a pool is like the budget seat.
Otherwise, if it's packing in the buyer with the original picture.
For example, from a computer game in a role fighter genre.
She'll get less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved both front and back seats, which provides the optimal reserve of space and for wide shoulders and for long feet.
More longer probably will be the fact that pressure in the front of the central tunnel is now mild and doesn't strike in the expressions.
The largest set of Mazda active security systems is exactly CX-5.
To recognize the potential threat, there are radars, lasers and cameras.
There is an adjustive and advertising on the east of the road, and monitoring the dead zones, and safe disturbance.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best baggage in the class.
The approximate with a minimum exhibition of 561 l. The back seats are contained in 4.2:4 and each section is decreased by a department of output - and increases the bathroom range to 1560 l.

Kiev destroyed the atomic unity.
Kiev officially refused Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the AES Chamber.
The top Council in the middle of the second trial still voted for the breakdown of the agreement with Moscow.
The delivery agreements of third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible.
In the middle of the High Council of Ukraine, the law adopted that distorted an agreement with the RF on the construction of the third and fourth block on the AEA.
The draft legislation could only be implemented by the Government only by the second vote, 210 deputats were first supported at the minimum of 226 members, but then 234 members of the Parliament were voted on the draft.
The SSR Hmelnic AES on the original project had to calculate four energy blocks of 1 GVT with VVER reacters, but only two were able to build.
The negotiations with Moscow on delivery brought to the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Agreement, the Council adopted the respective law in 2011-2012.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, the construction of blocks was supposed to be made to the Russian party's credit, but the resources were not so.
After turning to Kiev in February 2014 and following the refrigeration in the two countries of Kiev, he began to join Moscow to atomic growth by announcing the refusal to cooperate with the AEA and the draft building of nuclear fuel in Ukraine.
The only area where they were stored remained fuel purchases in the RF for Ukrainian AESs (approximately half of you were able to provide electricity in the country), since the Ukrainian NEC "Energy" replaces Russian supplys.
AELS and another subsequent in Ukraine have not yet been rejected: negotiations with the Czech Scod JS were still stated in Kiev in 2014.
UN Gensek against the use of military forces in the resolve of the Syrian conflict.
The United Nations Secretary-General Pan Gi Mun reported during the press conference that the situation in Syria would be resolved by military means.

The OPCE reported the possible meeting of the Ukrainian and Russian Parliamentaries.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine at the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) OBCE Arthur Herasimov reported the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in south-east Ukraine.
"What I know, a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian Parliamentary delegations," Mr. Gerasimov's statements.
He also invited the Mine Agreements to be implemented and "return to the normal viability of our countries".
On the question of whether the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level is currently considered " Normandian" or in the form of a contact group on the PA OPCE, Mr. Gerasimov, noted that the dialogue was conducted in the Mines Agreements.
At the same time, political statements support any kind of dialogue in Kiev.
The former representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, Leonid Kuchma's ex-president, said that the self-proclaimed Donekia and the Luganian Response principlely had changed their positions in three-side negotiations, but the tonality of the dialogue became more consistent.
Parties divided the orders.
Yesterday, the election committee of the Netherlands Norwegian led the outcome of the elections in the urban statement on the municipality, distributing 12 deputate mandates played on partial puzzle.
Traditionally a lot of complaints for injury in the course of elections were made by the representatives of the CCPF, accused of the election of the "faality of false".
The observations of the opposition were not adopted.
With the same election, the Russian Communist party was rejected in the organization of a referendum, which was cancelled by a multi-quarters household.
The City election officially made the results of the elections in the low Norwegian hormone on the municipal election area.
A total of 1.03 million people were included in the memory of electors in the Netherlands, which was issued by 746.7000 voters and voted on 268.000 electors.
More than 11,7 thousand bulletins were recognised ineffective and 24 - lost.
12 mandates were distributed among political parties yesterday depending on their votes.
The "Single Russian" spice of six deputates included Dmitria Swatkovski, Dmitria Redsova, Basilea Shupranov, Elizabeth Solenchenko, Veccella Rasterieva and Igory Nahorno.
The only LDPR mandate received the leader of Vladimir Zirinovski party.
Two of the CPRF mandates are distributed between Vladimir Bolanov and Hosdam's deputy Alexander Tarnai.
Three mandates of Justice Russia are obtained to Alexander Razumski, Igory Bogdanov and Michail Shalugin.
These candidates should now determine whether they will work as deputats in the city word for five days: in the case of a refusal of the mandate, they will go to the partylist candidate.
The chairman of the collegeman Alexander reported to the members of the Commission that it introduced a department for the "release of the telegram to the Gerinski and other" to refuse of the mandates.
In the implementation of the Protocol on the results of the elections, the representatives of the CCPF declared violations.
The member of the college member with the right to vote of the CCP Leonid Krasnokutski proposed not to recognize the results of the vote in four districts No.21-24, in view of that, as the Chapter of the Region of Sormo, the entry was closed from the administration, where four circle Commissions were available.
Inside, no deputats of Gos Woodma, nor candidates, nor observers could have passed a long time, and the rational scandal with the straight door of the radio administration was shown in television.
At the meetings of the Environmental Commissions, all overseers and members of the Commission with the right to vote had the opportunity to attend.
The Chapter stopped access only when the vote was completed and the Participant Commissions had not yet come to deliver their bulletins.
This was done in order to prevent various prophecies.
"Therefore the Chapter was corrected, and at all meetings the interested parties could be presented," a couple of the mountains held by Natalia Andrushina.
The Communists expressed that, in the locked opinion of the administration, the deputy of the Conference of Ludmile Aristva was illegally maintained by the Deputy for more than four hours. The following committee addressed the statement.
The opposition was also forced that in a number of WHIC elections on the day of the elections, the urnes were printed at 6 to 7 hours of the morning, making the bulletins for a long-term vote.
The members of the committee with the right of a meeting vote and observers have not been informed, so they have come to the beginning of the elections at 8th morning.
The communists are convinced that in the morning before opening the election parts in the furnace, they were able to put bulletins without control.
However, the mountains, which had already examined more than 124 complaints on different behaviors, did not find any infringements to the invasion of non-studied bulletins.
The members of the Commission and the proposal of their colleague from the " Justice Russia" Mary Pope were not supported by the displeasure of amendments to the Regional Law of Enhancement to clearly establish the time for the coverage of convergence with the budgets of the advanced vote that then fall into the urn.
"On the right of your own initiative, at least go to the CIC," recommended Pope Alexander's.
At the end of the meeting of the Chairman with sound accusations, the member of the CCPF Sergei Samohin cried out that he ignored the election of tens of complaints and covered the false in elections.
"You're not here on mything, you're more pronounced!" the president of the election was disappointed.
At the end, the protocol was almost uniform.
By 27 September, the election should be approved by the general results of the elections, after which the first assembly of the sixth assembly of the city of Netherlands will be appointed for three weeks.
In addition to the definition of the results of elections, the city election committee from the political party of the Russian Communists in the registration of the initiative group for the implementation of a referendum.
In view of documents, the parties were going to discuss two issues of the following citizens: are they with the fact that multi-quarterated household collections must be "repealed" and the tariffs for a community service "for freezing up to 2020".
However, the lawyer of Irena Maslova explained that the treatment of the Russian Communists is contrary to the law.
FedEx is a mixed character, a decrease of the predicts for 2016.
FedEx reported the needed results of the last quarter, and the delivery service gigant reduced the annual arrival forecast due to the demand for transport services and the growth of costs in its land transport division.
The company also claimed that it was planning to make approximately 55,000 seasonal architects at the festivals.
At the same time, FedEx reported that it would take 50,000 temporarily guardians at the festivals.
Its actions increased approximately 2.5 percent of preliminary trades for 45 minutes until the opening of the birds in the middle.
FedEx Corp. stated that it planned for $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year, which ends in May 20 cents less than in the previous project.
Analysis expected $10.84 to review FactSet.
The prevision is observed despite the average rate of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and the growth of the collections for earthly transportation of heavy or gabary burdens beginning in November.
The company claimed that it continued to plan the growth of the debt compared to the past year by reducing the costs, increaseing the debt income and online trade.
The President and the CEO Fred Smith stated that the company "regarding the prognoses, economic perspectives, especially in the production and world trade."
The plans for slave forces at the festival were declared on the day after the competitor's statement, UPS, that they were planning to make more than 95,000, approximately as much as they had been adopted last year.
For the quarter that ended 31 August, FedEx had $692 million, 6 per cent more than year ago.
Income of a share with $2,42, nearly the average predict of $2,44 per action conducted by Zacks Investment Research for 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5%, up to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analytics requested Zacks were 12.23 billion dollars.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from the fall in the emergency transport sector, which has resulted in the lack of income growth in its division.
However, the purchasing bump on the Internet was quite improved in FedEx Ground.
In the latest quarter, the departure of land transport was increased by 29 per cent, but the operational income remained totally unchanged due to increased expenses for major transmission and self-security.
A higher income income from higher basic rate, while income in the burden sector was increased by the labour payment cost.
At preliminary markets approximately a hour before opening the FedEx action at $3.85 or $2.5 per cent - up to $150,15.
They closed on Tuesday, falling on 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the record from 11 June.
At the most expected meeting for several years, the Federal Reserve System will take two days on this week after a 27-foot table from the Ghondora Red Tree, decideing whether the key rate should be raised for the first time in nearly ten years.
At one end, a richly ornamented committee for meetings at two stages above will be embraced by the United States.
This map is a reminder that the chairman of the Federal Reserve System of Jenet L. Jellen and its colleagues should place the economic interests of the country above all other.
The Central Bank received a double assignment from the Congress: to maximize the employment in the United States and to maintain prices here.
However, since the Great Recession, the Federal System holders have recognised that there is a third uninscriptional task: financial stability.
And this third assignment may be a non-president factor in the almost prospected decision that will be declared on Thursday, on whether the United States economy is ready to avoid an unpresidential incentive that is guaranteed by a short-term rate at the end of 2008.
Even if most data have a safe growth of the economy, recently on the world financial markets can also maintain the careful roles of the Federal System of Volatility by raising the basic rate on the federal funds - only for the fourth rate of the rate.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Pegza, the main Broker Economy of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I think that if they were to seek the reason not to take the taxes increased in the uncertainty around the world market enough to give them the right to wait further," she noted.
There is no consensus on what they will do in the Federal Reserve System, which is self-production of the financial market.
Approximately half of the economys recently requested Bloomberg has been a prognose of the increase in the rate of this week.
Financial markets, however, expect that the Federal System will be maintained, while the key indicator only shows about 30% of the probability of a quick sum.
This may lead to the fall of the market of action if the Federal System is raising the rate when those who make decisions will not be affected by the promise that the greater increase will not be.
On Tuesday, Dou-Jones index rose to 228,89 points, or to 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The injury was developed by the expectations that , which determine the Federal System will leave the rate for this week , stated John Lonski, the Master Economy Group of Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"I'll be surprised if the Federal System will increase the rates at this time," he noted.
If the Government of the Federal Reserve System is so, "they will have to go far away in their own ability to keep the financial markets in their hands so that they may not be panic."
Other experts expressed that the increase in the rate could make financial markets calm, since it would have an uncertainty in the conduct of the Federal System.
For a whole month ago, the Federal System had declined to increase the rate of 0.25 per cent in this month, making the first small step in the slow growth of the financial assets that could confirm the sustainability of the restoration of the United States.
Yellen stated that at the beginning of the year, she expected an increase in the rates in this year, despite the complaints of the Liberals that it had greater economic progress.
Although the appearance of new slaves was quiet in August, the growth of the labour market was stable this year.
Without a decrease, it reduced to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest indicator for more than seven years, and almost at the level that the Federal System considers full employment.
The growth in the area shows the signs of the advancement.
And although the inflation continues to be below 2% of the central annual indicator, the Government of the Federal System stated that it was a key reason for the timely effect of the rare oil price falling.
"The economy can also be taken with higher rates and needs, taking into account the reduction of the labour market," said Ian Shefferdson, main economy Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the worldwide financial markets have been acquired at the end of the past month, after China is disabled.
The average index of Dow-Johns for industrial companies has fallen in a total of 16 per cent of high importance in May, since investors feared that the slowness of the Chinese economy could cause global growth.
The market was partly restored its positions in this month, and the Dow-Johns index is now about 10% below the highest majority.
For the leading of the Federal Reserve System, the market force is further complicated by insufficient estimates of the rate increase.
"If there is no information on the financial markets and the news of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would be able to disturb the stakeholders at this meeting," said Steven D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Centre for Real Estate and the former Federal Reserve System.
Now, according to his predicts, they will wait at least a month to get more control of the consequences.
"There is a great indetermination in how the impacts of the American economy can have, and they have almost no reliable data after the last events in China," said Olinner.
The healthy global economy does not include the main concerns of the Federal System, and technically it should not be taken into account when taking these decisions.
However, the Federal Reserve System has become a global financial authority.
The impact of the Central Bank in recent years was great.
Only one intention from the former President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could "deploy" its daily expansion, called on the world markets.
In the world where markets and economic systems are still greater than one another, it could be expected that the Federal Reserve System Routers will not only follow the development of events overall but also consult the representatives of other Central Banks and experts in order to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is "more experience than science," noted Zakari Carabell, the Envestnet Inc, a company who is undertaken by global status management.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve System, there was a excessive reaction to the movement of the financial market which seems not to have economic principles."
Laker, a member of the right to vote of the Relevant Federal Committee on the Open Market, introduced as an example of decisions 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia has led to that the Federal System has decreased its basic rate by 0.75 per cent for three meetings, "without the identified consequences of growth in the United States," Laker said.
Year later, the Federal System rejected these decreases.
The Federal Reserve System should be placed on the first place in the time of great crisis, such as market disorder in 2008," said Adam S. Pozen, former member of the Bank of England rate rate committee.
After panicing and nearly approaching this level, he said.
"You would, of course, not want to be in the situation when you're afraid of growing rate because of the markets' concerns," Pozen, President of the World Economy Institute, said.
The Federal Reserve System Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think that they should warn the events.

Speaker Hosdam Sergei Narskin admits that the United States are destabilising the situation in the Middle East, so that the refugee waves will fall into the destruction.
As the Interfax transmets, he expressed a view to journalists in Ulan Bator at the session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a partner of competitive theories, but the question is asking myself, is it not exactly the final objective of those who have destabilized the situation in North East and the Middle East in recent years?", he asked the question.
"It was likely that somebody assumed and knew that the rivers of refugees, these unfortunate and disappointed people who were rescued from death, would be entered into the good countries of the EU," he added.
Narriškin said, "Are many political leaders expressly stated about the reasons of this crisis, the whale of refugees, which are literally injured by their country?"
"No, the old one, except rarely, prefers silence," he states.

Putin invited the world community to join the forces with Assad to combat the Islam State.
In commenting on the continuous statements of the West that Asad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to the authority of the people by the choices, and if it goes to the request of the people and not to the decision of the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communist.
"If the people want to stay, the president remains, and in the other case he should leave immediately," he emphasized.
Asad called Russia and Iranian friendly countries and told them that their cooperation was involved.
Syria also fights terrorism together with neighbor Iraq.

Tegeran's putting us a military technique.
" Of course, there is a exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange was always about," he explained.
What the rest of the states is, we are open to cooperation with any of them in the presence of a serious desire to cope with terrorism.
"We do not see that in the case of such a called anti-terrorist and antigyl coalition, known by the United States," said Asad.

He stated that at the phone interview of the "Lenty.ru" co-respondent.
The note in Washington Post is that it's been clearly denied.
The former Defence Minister of DNA Igory Streelkov, of course, had no one associated and "come out" from the Resp Territory of Donbass in full similarity to the creation, without a bullshit, without three hours of money that are allocated to him by different persons," he noted.
According to Borodya, the report on the Arrow in the reporter of the American newspaper was actually.

Borodai stressed that he was not aware of why the American issue's co-responsor decided to write about that the Arrows were exported to Russia's territory.
I suspect that it's a provocation.
If it's not a provocation, it's a wonderful way that the words are misunderstood because I underlined that the Arrows went away," said Borodai.
"It's a curse on me and on the Arrows," he concluded.
The Washington Post was previously found in the article in which the words of Borodya were made on the fact that he had exported the Arrows to Russia in a forced order.
According to this issue, Borodai noted that he had to connect his fellow.

Furthermore, this is a fundamental problem that will enlarge society.
It will begin to read with what it did not before.
The Brazilian Union of Rio Grandi's pediatres promotes health food for feeding breasts
Brazilian pediatric SPRS has developed a scandal method to ensure that women need full-valued food during breast-feeding: the method underneaths the images of children who are cut off the breast, distributed by food.
Feast milk consists of various whites, jewelry, vitamins and waters from which children receive all the foods they need to form a strong immune system.
In the light of high energy needs, women and women are recommended to increase the daily standard of calories by approximately 500 calories per summer.
Nevertheless, a recent study has shown that one increasing calorie is not the only change in the diet that the mother should do.
In a recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor of the Medical College Baylor in Texas, the healthy feeding of women in the reality affects gene expression and prevents the development of their inflammation.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of the nutritional nutrition on the child ' s immune system was detected.
Under Hamburg's train, the school bus was protagonizing.
Near Hamburg, the train was thrown into a school bus, which was locked on the railway.
A 23-year-old woman leader, who realized that it could not be moved from the riles, had 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And in a minute after that, they had a confusion in their eyes.
He's founded one of the schools on the video.
Because of a disaster situation among the students, there was a panic.
Children began to weep and flee down the face.
The road remains locked until this pool.
According to the police, no one suffered miraculously, except one passenger of the train that had been injured.
Avery damage was estimated at 300 000.
Doctors are calling to prohibit boxes.
Ru's development of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called to prohibit boxes in the country after the death of David Brown's younger sportsman.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown ended with the trauma received in a single with the Philippine Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles on the version of the International Boxer Federation (IBF) in a weight category up to 57.15 kg on Friday ended with the winning of Magalie in the 12th round.
Brown's gone to the hospital with a severe brain trauma.
It was evaluated as a crythe, and it was connected to the lifeless equipment.
Brown had 22 victories on the professional market, had only two distress, and one battle ended with the neck.
He had two kids left.
This is the second case of the summer outcome among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, the 23-year-old student Braddon Smith ended the traumatism on the market.
Now AMA recommends not to do this, but, in its view, to prohibit it.
I understand that this happens increasingly, "affirmed by the Vice-President of the Organization of Steven Pernis.
But in the way there is a box now, there will always be situations when the sportsman gets blood-ease or brain trauma that leads to death, or to harmful damage.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that encompasses doctors and medical students.
Sergei Nariskin invited the OPCE to cancel the sanctions against the FR Parliamentary.
Spyker Hosdam RF Sergei Narskin called an invalid application of sanctions against parliamentaries.
He stated that at the PA OBCE session in Ulan Bator.
We appreciate this as an inappropriate action, as a valuation of the Parliamentary Diploma.
"And this should not be repeated because this is the manifestation of political insult and the ignorance of the principles of the open international dialogue," politically said.
Furthermore, Narishin invited the OPCE participants to restore the Russian and EU partnership.
Let's return morality to politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to the international community.
Let's return humanitarian ideals to the democratic peace order.
"The double never ended anything good," he said.
By speaking from the Courts of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Sparker of the Russian House invited the parliamentaries to establish an interparlamentary contact group on Ukraine.

At the eighth session of the Parliamentary Assembly, on Tuesday, on 15 September, in Ulan Bator, and will be extended until 18 September.
I enjoyed a couple of three days.
World Champion on a easy athletic Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumphate for a 24-year-old light athlete from Barnaul Sergei Shubencova.
He has succeeded at its coronal distance to win 110 metres with bariers at the command priority, to set a few records, and to become a world champion, and first in the history of the fatherly barber pressure.
Moreover, the Sportsman has recently won the final stage of the Brilliant Liga, taking the third place in general.
The new reports asked Shubenkov to share the impressions of the outcome season.
Sergei, isn't the season yet finished for you?
Yes, I'm going to speak on World Warrior Games that will go on October in Korea, and then I'll think about relaxing.
True, I'm going to be ready at the house now in Barnaul, and to be home, it's still different.
It's more than to be moving in the world every week.
You said the egg is a favorite time for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is time.
The suffering after the main start of the season has been discharged, the burden of responsibility is no longer given.
It may be a pleasure, "free."
Plus you know that the department is quickly...
Is there any furiousness?
Still, the season, the mass of local emotions...
The distance to the end of the season is always packed.
And it doesn't matter what he did more -- he wined or lost.
Each of them is stress.
Permanent overflows, moves, it's not all the way for the body.
You arise physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course.
I'm just happy!
At the moment when finishing at the world campaigns in Pekina, does it return often?
There's.
Yes, you, journalists, don't let me forget about that.
But I think that the bad sportsman who lives by old wins is going to re-effect his successful running again and again.
I enjoyed a couple of days, and we need to move further.
Was preparing for this wonderful season very different from the normal?
I can't say there was something special.
We started to be ready in December, but I missed the winter with the winter season.
Tren slept at the house in Barnaul, then at the assemblies, then again home.
It's like usual.
But the trainer was assigned: trying to get out to a new level that I have not yet been.
Almost all the winter time was spent to put the base.
They run a lot of cross, practice on the public facilities, including the burden and the neighborhood, and we broke up.
Then they were prepared for bars, and many were employed with technology.
How did the opponents follow?
I'm always trying to do this, well in the Internet's time, there's no problem with it.
He looked at the winter championate, and there the whole piedest was taken by the French!
I'm still thinking, you have to do something to distribute this company.
With each start in this season, you added and added results.
Did that give confidence?
I have all the latest seasons consisting of the same scheme.
Nothing I'm running to sleep is 13,20, and then 13,50.
I always deploy my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do is getting out of 13 seconds.
All work was addressed first to this result.
But the paradox is, like, that you feel ready to move, and that you are not always ready to show your preparation.
How was that, for example, in the Olympiade in London?
I, if honestly, was that half-final run (Shubenkov wasn't able to go to the final.
Something was very good, really could run out of 13 seconds.
Yes, even if he had repeated his best result at that moment, he would have been a bronze prize of the Game.
But not lucky.
Remember your first world campaigns?
What about it?
It was in Tega.
I wanted to go to the final very much then, it was a program-ma-mum.
And he went away from the morning, in the preliminary runs.
Then I realized that to break and wear a break - means not come anywhere.
Two years on the world campaign in Moscow has already been finalized with the best time.
I remember my feelings before the resolving teeth: I was very willing to win the gold at that time!
How can it not be able to disappear by developing an advanced speed yet?
And that's the most complicated thing.
We need to be very accurately focused on the technology so that the bariers should not be cut off.
I noticed that when you're looking out, not for the result, but for the process, it's so much more.
And it's the big thing when you're feeling that you're running and it's like it's getting yourself!
Honest word, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depth after the first serious success are trying to move closer to the capital.
Has there never been such thoughts?
Home's still better.
I don't know where I am without my trainer who I need?
Maybe it's good to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be satisfied with what I have.
You've been together for a long time?
From 12 years of age, since he came to the athletic.
More precisely, I dream with his wife who worked with children, and then she delivered me.
I started with the print, and then I was in the length of the triple.
Children's multiplying was when they shoot the ball, they're getting in the length of the place...
At 14, I tried to run with bariers, and I liked it.
From the first time, it was able to implement the rules of the second adult class.
That's how I'm staying.
Has there never been fear of bars?
Sometimes, there was an agreement with them.
But the technician always had to work very much.
It's over one of them how painful it was!
But this routine doesn't come anywhere.
The technician must be continually drawing up so that I can wake up the night, I'd rise up and run through the bariers.
Everyone who has seen your run in Pekina say that it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked myself.
I usually don't check out my runs, but I couldn't stay here.
But the efficiency needs to continue to work -- there are no definitions of compatibility.
Do you not be afraid that victory for a year before the Olympian games is on the back of a heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, I'm trying to justifie expectations.
Once you chose this way, you must go to the end.
My trainer likes to repeat: "If you're not a man, you don't have to feel any extra burden.
And I'm absolutely in that with him.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so naive to bring me a surprise of an interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are worried, I understand, they don't eat their bread, give them, breathe.
And even though I didn't get a flag, and the same thing, a million times talking here, and no one's calling, the other thing was me.
All my pseudodories were able to get out there for a second.
The pressure I'm understood is so much that even I, who saw the kind of boys, think people were white.
It's like he's gone, and the crowd's attacked you, and he's mutualizing you with the pigs.
But you need to know me, I'm not a commat arrow, I'm a cowboy, I'm cut off, old, guys, I'm afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have such an illusion, and now...
The best in me was always self-advantage, so try.
And giving a passport to people like Fred Derst or Monson, they can only be shoots.
It's better for me, the best journalist, to be insane.
A week ago, Otar Kushanashvili characterized criminal events:
What they have done with the Crymean is a crime.
That's exactly what they are called the behavior.
I guess it's the way the Crossman tried to sign something, and it's no longer entered into the general image of the community.
It's how to come to the neighbor and take his place...
The War from Creml went out, and it's just over there.
I am almost sure that, as in 2008, she started with a call from a cross-case.
I'm wondering who it could be...
Cobson isn't so much to live.
I don't understand he's the biggest artist, why he needs to cut the hands of Pu.
He's gonna lose the apartment?
Well, you brought him a memory.
Of course, the people have seen him as a small family.
Now the conquist is only dependent on Vladimir Vladimirovič.
Sunrise of the Seventh leads to the review despite the trials of the Nineth to light the loss of leaders in Today Show
The outcome of Carla Steowicz and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra for the consequences of the Liberal Party's statement of freedom of the leader's place, was unable to raise the review Today.
The morning show of the Nineth Transl is from the capital of the State after Malcolm Ternbulle Tony Abbots was devastated.
Concurrent Sunrise, with David Koh and Samantha Armitage, arrested London within a weekly series of international meetings, including Dubai, New York, Nigara-Folz and Cancun.
It seems to have no significant importance for Australian telasers, while Sunrise's audience counted 397.000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to Today's audience in 339.000.
Today was a little more compared to its review on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced Sunrise breaks last months.
In August, Today had 318 000 in comparison with 330 000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, 40.000 to 50.
Until September Sunrise has 349 000 lookers against 314 000 in Today.
It's the most interesting thing that happened all the morning.
Wind changes affect more than Parliament today tomorrow, guys!
Carl and Lisa are all right, thank you for accurating!
TODAY was opened on Monday, 14 September 2015.
The important news for the Seventh was a depth of 800 Words with the former series of Packed to the Rafters Eric Tomson.
The new drama of a recent widow father, who decides to move to New Zealand to life with his two children, has gathered an impressive audience in 1.219 million viewers.
The critics considered whether Tomson could handle the Pope's show at the same time, without the Rafters stars of Rebecca Gibbnie.
The result of yesterday evening is a sound "yes" answer.
The X Seventh Factor remained in strong places with 1,136 million viewers, easily running the Block (838.000) and TBL families (726.000).
For the Seventh, happiness and failure were mixed at the second evening of Chase.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new television, which Andrew O'Kife led, gathered 446.000 lookers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the support number was up to 623.000 lookers - enough for a small winning over Hot Seat Eddi-Gwair (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of Chase ́a gathered 520 000 lookers, and the second half-hour was a depression of 720 000.
Hot Seat gathered 620 000.
The fall of Chase's ratings on the second evening will make the Nineth quietly recognize that Hot Seat will still be dominated at 5.30.
Chase-a is a replacement of Million-Minute, which doesn't want to play a show-Gwair.

Three finalists are single in that "Holstock" with Wood is a perfect guy, but who are you doing?
The secret is open?
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah-Key and Snow-Snow Markoski may have made a chance of understanding who of them wins in Holoscake.
The woman with the Wood in Holostake, finally, is surrounded by the secret.
And three who come to the end of the end, they keep silence on who of them had his last rose.
But when we met Sarah, Snow Markoski and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the day when two of the three girls must stay, they may be unexpectedly given a suggestion about the winner.
With Wood keeps silence permanently until the end that will be held on Thursday
All three women come into a statement, explaining why Wood's perfect man, mentioning his feeling of humor, completeness, family values, lifelessness as the reasons why each of them would be happy to become his partners.
However, their answers to the question, "If you are not, who should be able to get after the Wood rose?" They could unfortunately point out who of them had actually won the heart of "Holostaca".
Jevons Fellows and Markoski, without doubt, called the ideal couple for Wood.
There have been good effects between Sarah and C since the first day.
"From the time I entered the number of participants, I felt energy (Sara) and Sam's energy and I realized that they were very suitable to each other, and I did not doubt about it during all the show," said Jevons Fellows.
"Sara is a very open man with her easy and fun," added Markoski.
I've seen them together, there's really an attractive between them.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah'kay believes that Sam Wood will have a great couple of her.
Sama said that through home meetings last week she realized that Wood might be "the most man".
"When I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it wasn't just a game -- I believed him with all my heart," she says.
On the question who should be chosen by Wood, if it is not her, she answered mysteryly.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both of them the same, and Snow and Lana are worth it at the same level.
The Bachelor Shaw is running in the middle of 19.30 on the Ten channel.

Jarrid Hein had a few options for the start of the career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in them after his movement to the United States, as well as other clubs who sent requests after the impressive open training day at the end of the past year.
But Hein chose San Francisco 49ers and Dr. Jim Thomas, and it seems to be a wise decision.
The trainers would leave Haine on the stone of the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former player of the Australian Regby League allowed on the first return of the paint in a winning game with Minnesota with 20-3.
But Thomas believed in his player and - Hane - another opportunity to return the Panth, and also involved it in the game after Reggie Bush's trauma.
Thomas showed himself on the good side and after the game, in the dish.
Instead of building the difference to new girls in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Haine at the press conference after the battle.
The 49ers Club Special Reporter Inman reported that Haine also received support from the Coordinator of the Special Team of Thomas, who advised him to forget the lost ball and to think about the game.
Jerryd Hane lost the ball on the back of the Pant with Minnesota Wakings team in the first fourth
At the beginning of the debut in NHL Hein and its many Australian worshippers were not clearly calculated.
It was seen how Hein was moving out of the field after the ball lost, and later he told the leader show "H" and Andy" at the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that could not have a more failure start for the NFL career.
"It happens, you're just thinking about the game and everything," he said.
Haine compared his debugging with the Origin series of games in 2007 when the casting of the balls in his carrier area had made Queensland's attempt.
Finally, this experience came to be complete for the 27-year-old player.
Hein photographed with the Australian flag and fanates after the game and made a picture in Instagram.

Four died when the police opened the shooting of the rezin pulls on the protestant in Nepal
Four men, including the four-year-old boy, were killed in the south of Nepal when the police began to shoot the rezin bottles in a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution of the country, as stated by the official representative in the middle.
Violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Rwanda area, approximately 175 in the west of Katmand, the capital of the country.
Best Prasad Dakal, head of the Police, reported that more than 1.000 protesters were gathered at one of the police's initiatives, some dropped stones and burned bombs.
Mr. Dakael reported that the police ispoyes were spent a trailing gas and then shot in the air before they dropped the rezin powder.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were hurt, he said.
It is not aware of why rezin poles, which, as possible, can be killed, have been traditionally used as less than the alternative, caused such a high level.
This meeting was the last weeks of anxious protest in the southern Nepal, where the representatives of the community claimed that the new provinces of the new constitution would reduce their political impact.
Protests also passed on the west of Nepal, among the citizens of the people of Tara, who want to have their own state.

Sajansk plans to create a business of 900 slaves.
Sajansk is the youngest city in Ireland.
In the 1970 ’ s, he was built as the center of the industry, and has developed the infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sajansk raised the new master, Oleg Borovski.
The results of the first year of work, new projects and workshops he related to the Correspondent " Oblast".
Oleg Valerievich, what did you start with as a master?
In the first place, I met the results of financial and domestic checks, the initiation of independent audit expertise for the expenditure of the budget.
Thereafter, a revision of municipal property was carried out.
One of the first practical steps was the reduction of the documentation to five days.
Earlier, the documents on the institutions could go for months.
Increasing income base and optimization of costs were held once.
In November of the past year, the Government had a great place in Sayanska, where the issues were discussed by the development of the territory were considered.
There was no project-computing documentation in the city.
Without that, Sajansk could not participate in the federal programmes.
We started with the preparation of PSD on the road, the garden, the north channel collector and water.
Road work on two parts is already conducted.
How is the order of President RF on the building of gardens fulfilled in the city?
In July of this year, 105 young people were born in Sayansk.
Such demography has not been observed in the last 27 years.
So the issue of security in gardens for today is one of the most current.
Since 1 September, the capital repair of the garden No. 10, calculated by 320.
The cost of the repair is 86 million rubles.
The city hasn't received such resources until this pool.
Last year after the repair, the garden No. 23 was opened, which now visits 200 children.
The reform was made under the conditions of co-financing from the regional and employment budget, and its value was more than 67 million rubles.
As a result of the efforts of the administration and aid of the Government in the field, a means to purchase mobile and equipment, as well as the National initiatives programme.
There are plans to start the building of a new garden in 2016.
With its introduction, we are planning to eliminate the age of children from half to three years.
We don't have the orders for children from three to seven years.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that building in the city should be performed, in particular, by the Saianian enterprises, and that it is precisely necessary to ensure them.
In October, a 60-quarters house for children in the Microrayon Leningradski is already exploited.
As a result of building, I add that Sajansk is one of the four towns of Priangaria, who has entered a program for the economy-class economy.
All documentation has been prepared.
The building of 90 blocks will begin in the next time.
We declared all about the building of 10 thousand quarters of livestock to participate in the programme very much.
One of the guile must be not valued by 30 thousand rubles per one square meter, which includes the "under key".
If we face the amounts set out, we will continue to participate in the programme.
What investors have, we have and other interesting projects.
During his time in the territory, the Saian sugar was built, which was sold in 2004 for unvaluation.
We are working with the prosecutor for the deployment of this deal.
More than the earth under the object is in federal property.
And the work with Moscow is addressed to transfer 88 of it to the regional property with the following transfer of the land into the municity.
There is a potential investor that is ready to put in the river and launch a project of 1.5 billion rubles.
We have 900 slaves with the army of the wheat, which will be a great support for the city.
Will Shaansk develop a partnership institution?
We have concluded 140 agreements with the economy of partnership.
Many projects have succeeded through the active position of business representatives.
Sensitive support is provided by undertakings such as the OOO " Oost-Center", the New-Ziminian TEC, the OO "Saian Briller", the OO "PK MDF", the leadership of these companies is responsible for all treatments.
Directly to the day of the town of OO 'Saian Briller', the city of the city of the city, the Woodok-Center, was repared to the horse court, where specialists are working with children of hypatherapy, spent more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to Spansors, the area of the city of the GASS has been promoted.
The sponsors helped to note the town's Day.
As in ancient good times, a couple of citizens and organizations participated.
The city was published, the book of the Saians Poetes.
The first builders and people who have contributed seriously to the development of Sayanska have been entrusted with jubilal medals.
Mecenates also participate in the city's welfare fund.
The first step was the acquisition of instruments for youth talents.
In nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles are addressed to support talented boys, to help those needed to be treated, to support children from unsecure families.
How are the Framework Problems resolved in Sayansk?
There are no doctors and pedagogs in the town.
For the solution of the framework issue, it is vital to ensure that specialists are awesome.
Last year, we assigned five apartments for doctors, and we received four pedagogs.
We've been working in a juice programme with the opportunity to privatize it in five years.
In the plans, a replaning of the opinion, which will build eight more apartments for pedagogues.
The teachers and doctors also participate in the "Gilly for the Russian Family".
In per-vive, the building of the house for the budgetary officers.
The most important thing is that there is a robotop team that I can resolve the most complex issues.
It is important of all crisis to make conclusions, and life will not stop.
The potential in Sayanska and our region is great.

Google starts a double campaign for a collection of 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the beginning of a double campaign for the collection of 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations that help refugees in the Pays of Peece who flee from the wars and the surrounding countries.
Google was a non-characterous personal approach to announce the collection campaign in his blog.
Instead of making a statement of one of the ru-human, the partner of Google Rita Massud, who was coming with the family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We've been on suspecting trains and buses, we've suffered from hungry, wheat, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But since the crisis of refugees and migrants has increased, people like my family are desperately needed to help.
The meetings will be transmitted to four non-Communities who are assisted to refugees and migrants: "Doctors without border", the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations Supreme Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would deduce the first $5,5 million until the amount on the google.com/refugeeerelief will not be $11 million.
It is opposed to the greatest crisis with refugees since the second world war, most of the four-year-old civil war in Syria, which caused more than 4 million people to move this year.
Many also flee from the battled wars of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Therapeutics with a small worm can help chemical surgery
A welcome effect after the chirurgical surgery in people with a small hepatitis of type 2 diabetes may be at least five years, a new study.
However, it is still so early to say that diabetes with a small worm will be longer after the chirurgical surgery than those receiving non-chirurgic treatment.
"The statistics are totally unconflicted," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on the chirurgical surgery, who wrote about a new study in the JAMA Surgery editor.
The chirurgical surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to decrease the size of the ice.
They decrease the feeling of hunger and make the ability of the organisms to eat food.
In a few years, the barriatic surgery has been effective for treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the main studies were conducted among people with more than 35 or above of the body mass index.
The VAT, a weight measure, is considered normal from 18,5 to 24,9.
IMO 25 or above states that human weight is exhaustive and that people with IMT over 30 are considered to be hungry.
You can calculate your MT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study of researchers from the Thailand hospital Min-Sheng General ispose data collected since 2007 to compare two types of chirurgical barriates - the shinting of yellow and handly gastrointestinal, with the medical treatment of the type 2 diabetes with a small heat.
The average importance of ICTs for those who have been involved in the survey has fallen from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, ICT has those who have received non-chirurgy treatment from diabetes remains at approximately 29.
Among those who were transferred by oper were fully treated by 36 per cent of diabetes, and in part 28 per cent.
In the group receiving medical treatment for comparison, the full treatment of diabetes was observed only in 1%, and partially only in about 2%.
Furthermore, blood pressure indicators, triglicerides and "bad" LPN cholesterin " were in general better in the surgery of the group," states the authors.
Researchers also control the level of hemoglobin A1s in blood, reflecting blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c should be maintained below 7%, write researchers.
After the surgery, the average haemoglobin level A1c was decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the therapy of the group, it remained stabil at approximately 8 per cent.
However, the best control indicators reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c did not reduce the level of employment for five years, as stated by Dr. Chi-Chang Su and colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results of two types of treatment surgery.
For the fifth year, compared to the group in hand-hand gastrointestinal, the shinting group lost more weight (18.7 kg/14.2 kg), increased IMO reduction (7.4/5.1) and A1s (3.1%/2.1%) and was closer to the full diabetes remission (46.9%/16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgery in part of the lifetime after five years, it is under investigation of the results of people with an exhaust body in Sweden that the treatment is actually leading to an increase in life, as reported by Blackstone from College of Medicine at Mr. Finix, the University of Arizona.
According to the Swedish study, the bariator chose to be involved, the probability of death for 15 years was about 29 per cent below compared to the group in which more traditional methods were applied.
Although the new study had not shown an increase in life, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with ICTs below 35 interested in such a procedure.
"The report is very important here, since it states that such surgery will include safely in a low MT group, where there is no increased risk of employment or initial diseases," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start seriously as long as the patient ' s MAT falls in the range between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to make people think serious about this," she said.
I feel that as soon as they take the genetic changes that are in their bodies, heat and diabetes, it is very difficult to turn it back.
In Mutistach, the bullets were taken out of the house of the basket and nine million rubels.
In Mutičas, they stole nine million rubles and three female shoes.
This is the "Interfax" reporting with the MVD RF press service.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two non-opened doors entered the house set on the street of Mountain, connected the 20-year-old son of the house, and threatened both the knife, cut 9 million rubbles and three shoes.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage was 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a voting case referred to in the article “Rashby”.
Faces from the family are risked to become homeless.
Only 23 Peterburg hotels have the right to place tourists who will come to see the world campaigns on football in 2018.
The rest of the guests have not yet been able to receive the appropriate authorisation.
Experts think that it's a very anxiety sign.
At the front of the world priority, the authorities need to consider urgently how to deploy all town guests.
Rosbalta's convictives believe that the cost of the rent of the apartment is 10-30 per cent because of the tournament, and after the campaign for the soil, it is necessary to pay over.
The world campaign on football for the authorities should focus on the Russian guests.
In accordance with the law written especially under the first, each hotel of Petersburg must follow the procedure of the class and prove that it corresponds to the number of stars and service levels declared.
It is now understanding that this will be done not all: Hotels are so scared of checks that they are not even sending documents on requests of the Federal Antimonopole Service for Petersburg.
According to UFAS Chapter Wadim Vladimirs, awareness has studied 138 hotels and now plans to make 34 cases relating to guests, many of which have not just responded to antimonopolers.
There are signs that the leading of three decades of companies was disappointed by the worst one or other number of stars in the advertising, Wladimirs noted.
The problem is that now, literally, every number, no one will lose before 2018.
The facts are suspicious that during the football campaign, the patient will take all Peterburg hotels.
Tourists can now calculate 30.50,000 numbers in the city.
According to Smollno, 17 five star hotels, 51 four stars, 100 two and three stars, 550 stars.
According to the first Vice-President of the Tourism Committee of Nana Guitia, only 23 guests were currently carried out - so much checks were carried out by the company accredited in Petersburg.
And if any hotel had ordered a similar procedure in regional undertakings, the Smoking on a surprise of circumstances was not.
That's what the past class may be more, but no one knows about it.
"The last half-years of the hotel have not been very attempted to pass the class," acknowledged the North-West Russian Union tourist Union of Ekaterin Shadski.
This is explained by the high season during which the hotels are more money and do not want to do other matters.
Another reason is that the budgets which have not been charged with the expenditure of checks, the procedure may be dealing with the guests depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
However, recently, the guests have been actived and began to make claims to the class, confirmed Chadski.
Hotels need to succeed until 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a lot, but they will not have the right to work on the world campaigns.
It is already possible that, depending on starship, a fixed payment for the hotel number will be made at the time of the tournament.
The forms for which the value will be calculated will be discovered in the year.
This has been done to avoid allowing 200-300 per cent exhaust prices, for example during the Peterburg economic forum.
We need to have conscience and not allow increases two-three times, but the hotels also need to pay for.
"I think that growth will be up to 50%," explained the President of the Russian Guest Association of Gennadi Lamshin.
In its turn, Wadim Vladimirs is not sure that price fixation corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much this is involved in economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"This is the best of the inconsistency," he said.
It's not clear that it's going to be with the Pope's necked hosts.
The Deputats of the House have introduced a draft law to which hosts should be prohibited in residential houses.
We hope that this law will not be adopted or will not be scattered by Petersburg.
"We'll stop the point of view that the hosts should be kept," Nana Guacchia believes.
However, it states that the owners of the ministries should be in any case prepared for the advantage of the Life Code.
If the House still approves the draft law, approximately 80 per cent of the hosts will be closed in Petersburg and at the moment there are 1.5 thousand numbers.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hotels of North-West Leonid Harbar, there are no two- and three-star hotels in Petersburg, which are soon exploded by football diseases, so there is a crossing on the side of the guests with four and five stars.
Such situation is similar to the situation when "on the 80-month stadium are 75,000 wips".
This can be corrected once in the account of the mines.
Their prohibition is "Idiotism": "I am strange that some people can live in apartments, and this is why they can't."
If the host is used as a community, I'm sure it's wrong.
But if it's like a guest in which the guests are coming for a short time, why wouldn't it?
Mines are risked to lose the world campaigns through football and because of their increasingness.
All the hundreds of small hotels are simply not able to pass through the class, and they do it themselves.
By 2016, all town holidays will be assigned to work.
"The companies that may take this procedure not so much, so they will be rejected from less payable orders from mine hotels and will choose those who are," said Gennadi Lamshin, adding that in several cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of the current checks are significantly above the Peterbourgs.
The cause of Petersburg ' s delay is included with continuous interruptions in the tourist block of the Government, which does not contribute to the compatibility.
Experts believe that if the Peterburg Hotels are not enough, the most important need is to focus on the areas of hotels and houses of rest.
For example, the 300-year-old Peterbourg celebration could be able to make a float, which means that tournament guests will live in the cabots.
Moreover, many sick people will be prepared to come on carriers in which they will be able to nightmare.
"The main thing is not to set so many guests to be empty then," is certain Gennadi Lamshine.
Moreover, a large population of football priorities will be embraced by the soil.
The most probably in the town will create the reservation of the apartment.
Arrangement rates will increase by 10 to 30%.
"Obviously, the first whistle is near the stage," noted the specialist on the Agency of Development and Research in Laris Bragin's insurance.
The price of the rent may not be returned to the previous level of the campaign, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will also contribute to the construction of new transport connections in the areas of the city, which it stressed.
You should not forget the qualities of the other person.
For example, Leonid Harbar is sure that Peterburg was always a hostile city in which people are not simply indicating the road, but can also carry out mini-excursion.
There's complications.
My father in 1970 in the court met a family from Murmanska, a father, a mother, and two children.
They were somewhere at night, and there was hard to sleep with the guests, and they were hard to sleep at the box.
"And the dad brought them into a communal apartment to sleep," reminded the council.
True, he added that this shit in the people of the city has not been left -- calling home with the consequences and consequences.
But may it be necessary to remember that in 2018 after the missing decisions of the House, the failures of the hotels and governments should be remembered?
Girin's "slil" of the Amurian area.
He was exciting today to look at the Cloud of Girin in Gosdam.
He did such things when our generation was still learning to trade newspapers, and it is still in a form.
The theme of the statement would like to be "the protest against the results of the elections in the area of Amur".
The protocols are not - because nothing; other protocols other than the elections signed, the LDR, judged in all things, are not.
This is He who lifts up the second place of Ivan Abram and cries: 'These is the victory of the electors.'
And there's nothing to do with Rodin, and then, after it's been broken from the president, it's introducing a fraction from the meeting Hall, literally "You're all with your fronts of your juices and bowls."
The press, of course, gives an accent not to Abramov, but to scandal and demarch fractions as a result of this scandal and of the violation.
Well, Volfovich was beautiful and elegantly stuck the Amurian area together with Abram.
For the whole country, this is a regular outcome in the style "Podonki" of the Jericho, and it is not a protest of the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the fraction has formally scanned, and the choices to believe in the site of the party and Facebook of Ivan Abramov are not recognised, but the leader is obviously asleep.
It provides the dead in Amur to protect their dead, and itself gives good news against the "Only Russia" at all and in nothing from the family.
It is a wonderful decision to not lose the face, and to the present, and not to the demonstration scandal.
Another thing that is now in a strange position is Abraham himself.
Furthermore, he did not expect anything from the beginning, there were no alternative protocols on his hands.
He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other hand, for the use of a circle, it is the conduct of the champion, and, on the other hand, the Hamish falls in the address of the ER and the UNF.
And here, of course, he needs to think very seriously about what to do.
Because from the main election beneficiary, the policy number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 to the only single area it can be converted into a money that has succeeded by its own partial guide and super-distort for the same UNF and the partial leadership of the strange.
That's exactly that there would be no Girinski, it would have been to think about him and to watch him closely.
It's still growing and growing.
The news was that the LDR would return to the room during the same plenary.
That's what the bathroom fell down from.
Only the theme of Abram was buried.
That's really beautiful.
"It's not worth everyone to come inside" -- Dalai-Lama -- RT News
None of the refugees can be taken, said Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current crisis of refugees is on the Middle East.
The Tibet Buddhist leader invited me to stop violence in countries, and I was a family refugee.
Dalai-Lama addressed the continuing crisis of refugees in the opening of the Dalai Lama Compatibility Centre in Oxford, at the beginning of its 10-day visit in Britain.
He stated that the interests of the country or even continents should be higher than the interests of the country.
He also emphasized that, although this causes exciting, the reaction of Western countries to the crisis of refugees is not appropriate.
"It is impossible that everyone comes into the matter," he noted in his statement.
Although Dalai-Lama was highly concerned about the activities taken by Germany and Austria in relation to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary decision.
"The concern of thousands of refugees is it, but at the same time you must think of long-term decisions, how to bring true world and current development, mainly through education, in these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of power.
The use of power has never solved these problems," he added.
With regard to violence, Dalai-Lama also commented on George Bush's action after terrorist acts 9/11, stated that the worst reaction of the United States had launched the ticket of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sickness in the letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem could be due to no violence.
I know that his powers were good, but he applied power, and that caused unexpected consequences," Dalai-Lama said.
Four-fold growth of children, discontinuation of hands in the last 4 years
The environmental centres in the United States reported about about 400 percent increase, starting with 2010, the number of children less than 12 years of age, to promote a dezinfectation tool for hands with high-containment, as reported by the Classic Centre of Georgia.
According to Dr. Haylord Lopez, the director of the Centre of Georgia, the advertising of children to 12 years for the disabilities of hands reported in the biological centres increased from 3266 in 2010 to 1617 in 2014.
"The children are more contacted with these things, and, despite all, some percent of them are sent to rapid assistance," said the CNN.
He told that some children drink disinfectating weight especially, and some do this to impress their friends, or to networks.
In Youtube's video rolls, adults see how they drink a dezinfective weight as a rain drink.
As reported, adults mixed the deficiency of the weight of the spiral weight in order to get a stronger drink.
Children of the younger age may be acknowledged by deficiency disorders.
"The baby doesn't think that can't do it to him," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractives (deficiencies for hands) are those who are arrogant.
There are discontinuing weights for the hands of cockpits, wine, applecine, which are very attractive for children.
The disinfecting weight for hands contains some 45 to 95 per cent of spider.
Small children, especially, can cause a few races of alcohol.
"This is a high-country speech," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Steven Thornton, the main doctor of the centre's doctor at the University of Kansas.
You wouldn't just leave the whiskey of the whisky, but people's looking at these dezinfiction tools for hands, and if children get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naijah Russell, a six-year-old girl, who recently broadcasts a dezinfectation tool for a Club Aroma in approximately four races, was sent to treatment for rapid assistance.
The level of alcohol in her blood was 179, twice more than an adult, which is deemed to be in the status of alcohol disorder, according to Dr. Chris Ritchi, a rapid assistance doctor who had treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Centre near Atlanta.
Naijah was able to walk when she was delivered to a quick help.
The doctors watched her all night in a clinic that would not miss any signs of brain traumatics because the girl fell and was hit by alcohol, said Ritchie.
"This was very strict," CNN Ortorium Scott, Naidge's mother.
This could be fully worthful for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use unexpected arts or discontinuing salpets, besides to remove dezinfecting liquids for hands of children's achievement area.
In addition to alcohol disorders, some disinfectating weights are related to the weights.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after the dezinfectation of the substance containing a toxic increasing ingredient.
The health factors understood that the product contained metabolism is a mortal agent, not a ethical speed, which was indicated as an artificial art.
In January, three four-class students in the north of New York agreed to devote their "other" teacher through "proliferation of anti-bacteriaal arts in the class", the police report.
The teacher has a strong alergy on the dezinfector for hands, and she prohibited to keep them in her class.
The police believes that the failure plan was " empty" and addresses the questions of the discipline to the school area.
As the oldest library in Barnaul, she became a family club.
On the back of the stick at the entry into the country library, their N.K. Crupe's cracked soap.
Children who come after the books are trying to feed her with confiths.
Some generations have already been walking in this library for 95 years.
The first readers in the twentieth years of the past centuries were drawing up sound letters, putting acacias in the verses of Miakov, conducting literature victories, and rewriteing with the wife of Lenin.
The rescription continued four years, and, as written in 1939, the newspaper "Young Stainer", "friendship between the Hope of the Constantinian Crops and friends of the City Library of Barnaul" has become stronger every day.
The hope of Constantino even sent to remote Barnaulian friends its graphy once.
And when the barnaulers asked whether the Hope of Constantino was not appealing to the library of her name, she wrote that she did not reflect.
The letters have been split in the museum for a long time, and the first readers' grandchildren and rights have to explain whose severe profile is enhanced by the library.
In the years of reconstruction, different people were often called: Why is the library not renamed?
Let it be a library of the name of any good writer, without political decoration!
The companions of the village library thought and decided to leave everything.
"Krupski" is, please, the most favorite and favorite library in Barnaul, like a "leninka" in Moscow.
In the field in the bibliography newsbuild, a trace from the yellow kirpion.
"The wallet of the exhaust city" is the favorite theme of Oli Moskovki's artist.
Earlier, Ola was a manager in the jury of the company, came to eight, left at five, and all other managers were different from the love for drawing.
And then, on the Internet, it was a statement: "There is a illustration for the book."
The book was written by a small American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" -- "My mom's cancer."
Oil made illustrations, and thought that life could end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it if you don't create them yourself.
Now she works in a library, illustrates the books of the writers of the world and makes it a story.
Traditionally, children are thinking to lose interest in the book that they are more interested in any virtual space...
But we are going to reading children, and their parents understand the importance of reading -- says the Russian Planet Director of the Library of Tatian Kushvid.
In the past years, we have even come to the point of confidence that a library needs, and she's gonna live -- the kids are coming here!
I know, the interest of reading returns.
The newspaper of the library will have a large exhibition expenditure with the updated exhibition.
Once in the quarter, new readers are recorded in the whole family library: mother, dad and children.
The library rejoices that the fathers and their children were more frequently coming.
If the child reads all of the Chukovs in two years, he needs books more complex in his age.
But now the law is acting, which prohibits the eight-year-old Underkind to issue books of category 12+.
To get such a book, the kids have to bring their parents with them - they come back, then return again, and gradually "Kropski" becomes something like a family club for them.
The library contains treasures - a revolutional assembly with cattle and ears, bringing Queenco in the Annex to the newspaper News, in 1936 the "Murzelky".
Because we are now not only the conceptual space of the book, but we are now open for moving, we are trying to become a place in which we are: not a house, not a school, explains Tatian Kushvid.
We can come to us to read, play, draw together.
We made a game zone for the kids -- the kid's just going to play, and the hand's still looking at the book!
Some of our readers are born by parents, and they do not want to go.
Moms often are coming with bottles -- and we're glad that they put the library on the first place among all the rest of them where you need to come with the kids.
Tatiana Kushvid says, modern children like we ever love classic literature:
"The Issue is now developing, and a lot of attention is given to the authors that I am being involved in the interruption of generations."
And if they are talking about a little cup, they need to be a hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to dispute with their heroes.
The booklet continues to be issued for parents, in which it relates what happens in the modern literature, the books which should be focused on and why.
The booklets have so emphasized the intriguing and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is prohibited to bring out books for a number of reading rooms to adults.
This great privilege is only for children.
...The library has a square bullet with an ancient tree stairs in the pool, in the book storage.
It's a very old time machine.
You're met with the book of your personality, as with the old friend: Hello, good that we're not changing you.
Ellie's still awesomely walking on the road of the yellow kirpich, the toilet of the Tola Rizjikov, and the little Kibalcish doesn't say to the cursed war secrets, that's a firm word.
These books are such as passwords, in any way you can learn your own.
There are in the storage and actual booking rares, for example, a revolutional collector with cattle and hermes.
Or conduct the Queen in the name of the new magazine.
Or the "Murzelky" shot for 1936.
The time of the pages was lost, and they were cut into the tea color.
These publications are no longer issued to the readers.
It's the remuneration of our future collection, I'm going to get out of the pension and take care of the rare books.
But the kids are not going to do that, and the beauty in old books are not very light, and the subjects... you open the first page, and there is Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now, why did we all say this "Pioneer Truth"?
But it was still interesting -- says the Russian Planet, Gallina Ilasov, which leads to book protection.
The "Murzile" pages have been darkened from time to time.
Gallina Va'jevna has a bookguard all her life.
She knows the color of Buratino's pillars, in which Harry Potter's training year, the captain of Gryffindor's team on the cheese campaigns in which Carlson uses a mouse for a motorist, and who's the father of Alice Selcene.
The library is a little bit, and everyone who can live without these book lines finds a different profession very quickly.
Only the most convicted are: teachers, pedagogs, officers of the book.
They can also be learned by a smile -- it is considered a professional library.
If he laughed in the first minute, he was a professional.
I love books: how I like the library that they are to stand on the fields, and I also like to read them, says Gallina Va.
I read everything: military, history, stories, statistics.
Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I've got everything else in my mind.
The books were the most interesting and appreciating of everything that happened to me.
And because I loved them foolishly, I thought the library was a big place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be, despite the leaders.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring children, as well as the uncles...
Auditor: "Seltic" has no differences
Griffits rejected the differences in the "Seltic" after Dale's recognition that "Hops" is in a bad position, but he's going to correct it.
Harts will protest against the claim of the Scotland Football Association to Neilson, and Warberton is afraid of signing contracts in January that may violate the unit of the team
Dons increased the benefit before Seltic to five points
Adam Runey's penalty in the first time gave Aberdin a small benefit from Gamilton in Pi'odri, which allowed Dons to get away from "Seltic" on five eyes.
Griffits dismissed the differences
This caused hearings about the differences in the Seltic, which were cut off by Griffits, saying that he and his companions on the team were not suffering from any strengthened criticism, preparing for meeting with the leaders of the Netherlands Liga.
I don't think we feel pressure, I think players are trying to do it.
The Netherlands are awesome because Scotlanders are not in fighting for the title de Bur
The former semi-defensor of Rangers and the former member of the Netherlands College Ronald de Bur stated that the Netherlands footballs have lost interest in Seltic because he is not composed of the Title of Rangers.
De Bur, currently the representative of the Ajaxus, said, "In Netherlands no longer are the most attractive moments of the "Seltic" games, and why?"
It's because it's not Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the return of Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested.
A lot of stress in the "Ald Company" games, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change all," said Dale
Ronnie Dale admitted that "Seltic" was in trouble, but the Norwegian trainer had vowed to change everything.
Following Malmoi's damage and, as a result, the outcome of the Champions' League followed the loss of 10 footballs of Aberdina, which now, in five rows, has taken a loop of the table.
However, Dale said, "The "Selitta" had bad periods and before, and we're going out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I understand that it's very sad, and many people are very, very bad or disappointed by what's going on.
We too, but we need to continue.
And we really need the "Seltic" support, because this player becomes much better.
Keeping together now is so important.
Warberton with unbelieving January transfers
Despite the opinions that have occurred a few weeks ago, which assume that he has determined some of the purposes of the January transfers, Mark Worberton's boss will not believe in the January campaign, saying that he does not want to break the unit of the team.
The former attacker Brandford said, "The Janvarian transmission window is very different from the summer window."
What happens to the players coming in the summer, you have a period before the beginning of the season for their adjustment, which you have seen in our own group in this season.
The command works really well.
Sometimes more is added to unnecessary players to those you really need.
The Mitch, interested in Seltic, intended to end the career
The attacking "Suncy" Mitch, associated with "Seltick" during the transmission window, claimed that he could leave the football after his contract with "Lebedi".
The 29-year-old player suffered from the problem of the throat for two years, and he couldn't leave Wals this year.
Harts are going to oppose the SFA in conduct of Nelson ' s statements
"Harts" states 2:1, when Patterson was removed and started to play 3:2, but the red card of the protector was later cancelled; this is the third red card of Coll's cancelled in eight months.
Nailson doesn't refuse his words, saying, "I didn't doubt the ethics, I'm not a comment of the game."
Griffits swore to avoid Myanmar.
The Hibernian team player received a complaint after admitting that he had a song on the words of the former Harts player Rudy Scacela.
The incident occurred in a papa in the Rouzbern region in Edimburg before the beginning of the Edinburgh district in Tainksle in March 2014.
"This was a darbie, and it was a burner," said the attacker, "I can be sure to say that I wouldn't come back to Tyncal if he doesn't play for "Seltic".
Donnelly: The Tannadis Council is sure in Dandy Unite manager
Simon Donnelly claims that the Council of the Directors of Dandy Unite continues to be sure that the team of managers will change the situation to the best, but it agrees that the deterioration of the situation in the field should be completed.
I think Steven Tompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the guys to get out again," Donnelly said.
Makinnes is glad that "increasingly" wins at "H" silton.
Derek Makinness recognized that Aberdin's team had to be desperately fighting against "H ́ilton Assis" to get the seventh victory in the first line, which placed them on five points above "Seltic", above the tournament table, using the Adam Runey's tools in the first time.
Inneses said, "No one of these teams would win anything, a cube, or a campionate of ligues that did not win the meetings like this."
The Level without the Scotch is not changed, while it is generally in the United Kingdom
BEZBOTICE in Scotland remained 164 000 people for the period from May to July, while the number of non-United Kingdoms totally increased by 10 000 to 1.82 million for the same period.
The level without employment in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher than 5.5 per cent by the United Kingdom, as showed the national statistical numbers (ONS).
At the same time, the employment in Scotland has fallen to 12 000 people in three months, while the number of employees now is 2.612.000.
The employment level for Scotland was decreased to 74.0 per cent of the quarter is higher than the average number of 5 per cent per United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Scotland's Affairs, David Mandell, commenting on the last numbers, noted: "The Government ' s long-term plan was based on the strengthening of the economy.
It was almost a year since Scotland took the story of the decision to remain in the construction of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the Labour Market of Scotland in the growth of employment and decrease.
Why I am a Witness of the Cause in Oklahoma
Today, when you're going to take a long step away from the jury, I'll see how humans are punished.
If that happens, and I hope not yet, I'll sit on the view gallery of the camera in Oklahoma, when Richard Glossy is punished by death injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials of his death.
The first request was made in January, through his close friend, and even though I had faith in a shock, I agreed.
With the arrival of this day, I'm afraid.
So why do you do that?
I agreed because it's a good way to tell the detailed story of punishment.
This would offer a unique racker.
Yes, the journalists are allowed to be present in the sentences in America, and because they often want more than they do, the results of the dark lottery will decide who will be chosen.
The number of presses in Oklahoma was reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever has been chosen, he will look at it without emotions.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit with Richard Glossy's closest friends, and we've got our own calls after a few months of telephone sounds and one visit that is two and a half hours long.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The Administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a block and a handbook to write what I see.
I'll have to look forward to all details.
One journalist in Oklahoma accused me of yours that I was acting as my integrity.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes it gets access.
I'm grateful to her.
She acknowledged that herself would "be better formulated," but she still thinks I'm wrong with what I'm doing.
Richard Glossy did not agree with what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he spoke.
I told him he could get me out of his shot of witnesses at any time.
But he wants the journalist of the international issue to be present there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that the voice will help the motion to cancel the penalty.
Kim Bellver, reporter from Haffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this, listen to the subcasts I've written.
I'm not gonna be here in detail again.
I can't be sure Richard Glossy is not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treize make him guilty of crime.
But I believe there's a great chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I am strictly sure that the evidence of the sentence was insufficient.
I think his punishment is wrong.
And I'm going to see him died from that racker.
I can't say that I'm totally objective.
There will be other reporters that can be addressed.
From me you'll know how it is to look like a person I like dies without need.
Persequent sex of humans was agreed to go out of the Canning River
I'll constell out of Canning Wayle town. I'm able to convince a man to get out of the Canning River and stay dry.
The people of Perta intended to go out of the police, but he was not aware that he was stuck on a few metres of the police officer who was trying to "convend him to go out to the Âg".
The Canning Wayle police was called on Tuesday on the fact of illegal proliferation to a strange territory in Bakingham.
When the police noticed a suspicious, he tried to get away from them and left to Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, come on, stop me," said the senior Sergeant Chandell Casldan.
Constable Laclan Perhavetz was not very interested in moving the form, so he spent a more safer receipt -- "conferences with good police."
"The people sometimes do strange things to try to get down," says Sergeant Casldan.
It's exactly what Ben Cazins' football-champion is.
In 2006, Cazins went to the club to go to meetings with the police patrol to check alcohol and tried to cross Suon.
His efforts were insolent, but they moved the people to obtain the "Ben Cazins biatlon".
Peter Mudi accuses the stewards of spying and threatens to get out of the horse
Peter Mudi accused the staff of Racing Victoria to try to put a spion into his coast last year and threatened that he would immediately leave the horse sport.
His mixture became stewards and ethics of Racing Victoria, which he accused that they were a personal campaign against him, and the records from Lady Tatai's start because of the violation of the rules of use of medicinal products on the beginning day, in the middle of the middle.
Mudy reported Fairfax Media that he always compared all efforts in the springs and was in a difficult situation when it came to the local result of the leader's cobalt test, which he could not explain.
He kept the language of suspects in the spinner for half years and didn't want it to look like green wine.
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I was suffering for a long time, but sometimes it's so driving you out of the wheel that you're not taking it anymore," said Moody.
They know that it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'll go home today and sleep strongly.
I want to walk with the high-heighted and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything possible for them.
When they start thinking that's wrong, I'll have to stop being a trainer.
Then I'll have to think what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody said sensationally during the racing.com interview that the ethics tried to spy in his horse.
"Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart sat in a comat with a man I'll call if they ask him and offered him in my coast to transmit information about what I do in the coast," said Mudy at Racing.com.
They're obviously thinking I'm a bridegroom.
If so, all of them must have been declared because the trial of me was not possible for them.
Robert Rollstone, former President of RVL, David Mudi, current president of RVL, and Bernard Sandry, the External Executive Director RVL, knew about it all the time and now they know.
Should it not make me think that the matter becomes personal?
Should the RVL not be courageous and call on the answer for what's happening in this business, other people, other than trainers?
Do I feel bad for this profession?
Are I so bad for this profession?
Maybe people think that's the same thing.
Maybe they have to take my license and let me go, and I don't doubt what I'm saying now may cause them to think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that's gonna get me a bit.
I'm really sick of this.
I will show pressure on them and be responsible for making decisions.
I have a family support, and I can go.
The trainer only grows in the long investigation of the case with cobalt and the Leader, and the latest recording of the lobsters from the start is to say that he can "short his licence on the table".
The most important of the preparation of the invisible Block Caviar campaign calls for the use of medical medicines on the day of the "smiley" after a compression of the bullet was made on the feet of the bullet, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on the springs.
"I must carry full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my mistakes made her a compromise on her feet.
She could get a compromise yesterday night.
She could get him yesterday as it was.
She was with him on a running day.
The Museum may be discвалифицирd for three months , the rules on the use of medical medicinal products on the day for the use of a compression, which resulted in the investigation.
It's anecdote.
People who create these rules don't know anything about the sheep.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it's gone too far," said Moody.
The leader who has made a ship and hidden from the event place in Cobrama, was arrested
The police arrested a man who was broken in the outcome of a cobrama's moto and hided from the place of the event.
The moto was delivered at the hotel at Royal Melbourne hospital with serious hurt after the car dropped him on Murray Wally Hayway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver had gone without stop to help the wounded moto.
On Monday, the 50-year inhabitant of the city of Natalia was assigned to the police in Shepporton.
It is supposed that he will be charged to leave the place of the event, to avoid help and to violate other rules of road movement.
Moto's 40-year-old Cobram's resident remains in a stabil hospital.
Craig Bellami's trainer is paying complaints of opponents in the application of heavy force receipts
Craig Bellami, the trainer of Melbourne Storm, called the criticism of the catching of the ball by his team as "the design of the agenda" by the two favorites of the NRL campaign.
The New Rusters Trenth Robinson said that the judges had allowed "Storm" to fight" with his team during the sudden winning of Storma at the final kval of the game in Sidney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncosse's trainer Wayne Bennet made a clear finding on Storm after his team won the final kwal tournament at Nozern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening when he called this game "typical" for the regby ligue and said that two of Queensland's team were not "too successful" in the handshop.
Bellami protected the capture of the ball by his team and stated that they were focused on the "contact" by capturing the ball.
Bellami added that he had the conviction of the criticism of his team by two leaders, since it means that they would be concerned about the possible damage of Storm.
"This continues to explode -- I didn't hear that Trenth Robinson talks about hard receipt when they played us with account 24:2," said Belami in the middle.
I can recommend that we have not changed anything all the year in our systems or technology, just in the last six weeks we have given attention to contacts when we are taking the ball, and this has become a return moment for us.
The train has been there for three years, and it has clearly trained a great team, so he is probably not used to lose, and it has become some of them.
It's fun, as it always appears in this year.
Bellamy supported the idea of Bennett about the "impressioning football" to his teacher that "St.George-Ilavarra Dregons" Bennett won in 2010, "scooking" football.
Wayne's talking about an appealing football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening, and see how impressive their game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was a lot criticized by calling a fascinating team, and Wayne said that it would never forget him.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers as an impressive football, especially his young half-shore protectors at their speed.
It's a football that you'd like to play when you have such players.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two half-protectors like Anthony Millford and Ben Hunt so they can play.
This gives me more confidence because they say these things, because some of them are worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they reached great games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storma and Rusters' game was consistent with a large number of eyes than the Broncos and the Caubouz game.
The "Broncos" game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the account? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more trials - and what, is it a impressionant football?
Or consider impressive breaks and failure attempts?
It's a ru for me.
If they mention us, that means we can meet them there at some stage.
"Storm" at the end of this week of the outcome, since they won the right to take the North Queensland Cowboys" or "Cronal Charks" on Saturday evening at the preliminary end of the AAMI Park stage, the tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Appealed to the preservation of drugs in Serbia is issued for $20,000
A man who threatened the life-life conclusion for the trying to assign 40 kg of cocain delivered to Queensland contraband was issued in charge of $20,000.
Marco Simovich, 29 years old, is one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drugs in the Solay jacket, which was from South America through Vanuatu and was incoming in Kamer in August.
During the morning, the council and his companions saw them at the court, and later he met them in Coomera Roadhouse coffee, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo car.
Although it threatens the lifetime for the attempt to take drug arts in a quantity enough to sell, it claims that the evidence of the presence of the last tried to get the whole party is lacking, and that a man could be in a coffee without any meaning.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flenagan doubted that the speaker should be released.
There are recently contacts with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the court in the middle.
In the course of the vote, he lying to the police about his finding.
The mothers and the remarks were proposed to make a total charge of $20,000 for its freedom.
"The two evidence shows that the amount of $20,000 is too large financial burden for them," said Judge Flagnagan.
However, one of these measures is not sufficient as a guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge has added.
It was allowed to be released by the charge that he would deliver his Australian and Serbian passport every day in the police and keep the order hour from 6 hours to 6 hours to 6 hours tomorrow.
Photos Cacicaris: "I've been assembling Greece, which has been bailing for the last seconds."
The main trainer of Greece Fottis Cacicaris gave his office after 1/4 final of Robotsquet-2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to his statement, the games decided where the errors were.
It was a big game, quoted by AFP Cacicaris.
We were prepared for a great game in the performance of the Spanish.

They were fighting until the last second.
Joel Friend: "I'll have the Coun's functions in the CSCA."
The newsman Joel Friend said he didn't believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed the confidence that his new club would be able to break a negative trend and finally win a ruling at the season.
I talked to the trainer Dimitris Itudis several times this year and myself, after I joined the team, quoted "R-Sport" Friend.
Yes, I'm gonna need a while to change to the central position, yet I've played a forward more in the NBA.
Now it's going to be more to oppose the big center opponent, but I've already been doing this before, so I think, and I'm going to do it now.
The Armies finally wined the Rogue in 2008.
From that hole, they came six times to Phineal four, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
It's supposed to have someone agreed to the team.
It's all the game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's complicated, I understand all the disappointment of the club and his patients.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, we have a good chance to win, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the mosquitoes have already arrived in the tour, and I think this year will be the year of the CSA.
I'm not a superstitious man and I don't believe any curse.
I believe in difficulty and determination, if you meet these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any certain rituals before the games, I just listen to and try to delay as much as possible.
Louis Enrike: "For me, the catch with "Romey" will be worthwhile."
The main trainer of the Barcelone Louis Enrike does not hide that he returned to Rome to the first tour of the group tour of the Liga Champions with Rome with feelings.
According to the teacher, the eye unit of his current and former team will be far offline for him.
At the same time, Louis Enrike trains "volkov" at the 22011/12 season, however, he was not able to demonstrate himself at the best side of the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome several years later, for which I had received a certain experience. - The official website of the WEFA of Louis Enrike's words.
I have exceptionally warm memories with Rome.
It's gonna be a game for me, but it's not so important.
It is primarily to start campaigns in the League from winning.
The August Meeting at Cubke Joan Hamper does not affect the operation of teams in the nearest cat.
I'm waiting for the "Rome" game that she's in series A against "Youventus".

Stephen Hog spake the girl's phone to make pedophiles send pictures
Pedophil split the phone of a 11-year-old girl to ask for violence against children.

The girl wake up, discovered the phone crash and found it in the hand of the Hogga sleeping.
She checked her and found shocking pictures, and then she focused on her mother’s attention.
The police came and saw five pictures, after which the computers found in this address, and found the "compatible" requests in the search system using words for discovering unfair children's images.

President Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe reads not that thing in Parliament.
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest government leader of the town, fell from the stairs that leaded up this year.
He didn't hurt, but the video storage scene was currently spread on networks.

Captain Arsenal Michael Artet says that his colleagues should support Jack Wilshire's traumatised game with Dinamo Zagreb
In the context of Wilshire Hunger, he also emphasized that only in September, and that if Wilshire's restoration is planned, he would not stop returning to Christmas.
In the most favourable development of the events of Wilshire, at least four games in England will be lost and, taking into account, his participation in the campaigns remains subject to the question.
The most important thing in this recent problem is that Wilshire was sure to end the previous season with the only trauma and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during the pre-session preparation.
Hunger: "This trauma doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not until the end of the bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just a accident.
It's not with the sticks or the trauma he had previously occurred.
These may be medical matters, but, as Hunger has allowed, there is an added risk for any player who returns to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also a disadvantaged trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has identified 23 different trauma that occurred to him in six years that passed from his debut.
Moreover, he only played in 65 of the 157 "Arsenal" games in the liga in the last five seasons.
If you look at the "Arsenal" schedule, you can note that in the six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier Liga clubs, which were most expired from the daily tragedy.
Hunger recognizes the probability of the deterioration in the round, but the Arsenale believes that the improvement of the trauma statistics in the last season will continue.
"It's time when you're returning to trauma, you're being vulnerable for some time -- for this time you need to restore powers and make competitive advantages," Hunger said.
Jack's young enough, and he's gonna work.
I hope he'll restore physically, I'm sure that his career is the one he deserves.
Arsenal starts campaigning in the League Champions in the middle of the "Dinamo-Zegreb" and will continue it on Saturday games with Chelsea and in the middle of "Tottenh" Hotspore and Hunger's mouth.
The Ector Belerin and Aaron Remzy did not come to Croatia, so most of them will play the Mother Debushi and Arta.
Hunger may also include Kiran Gibbs and Olive Giru instead of Nacho Morreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little move to the players that need it," Hunger said.
Although the "Arsenal" is unconditional in the F group, the "Ma·mor" stadium in Zagreb will be the most dealing with.
"Dinamo" did not lose any of the 41 cats from the way they had been able to perform the last season as "Invisibles".
On Monday evening, the stadium was affected by 3.2 balls on Richter's scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Hunger is sure that Arsenal has taken the lesson received last season when the team has suffered the damage in the Monaco Champions Liga, and remains hoped to bring the club to win in Cubka's final campaigns.
"It's an incredible driver," mentioned Hunger.
Arsenal never did that yet.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I was a stageman.
We have an ambitious ambition, but we're not a murderer.
FriendsFest: a chemical show that gave us serious lessons of a man's friendship
The absence of such stories is given in the eyes, especially if the depreciation of the need for men in openness is now more than ever, while the level of suicide among young men is at maâmuma in 15 years of age.
In 2013, this was the only biggest cause for men's death between 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom, and men were three times more often than women.
In trying to find out the problem of the Campaign against Disaster Life, it announced that in 2015, men were to leave the challenges of a culture that would not allow men to seek assistance when they needed.
The friend is in the center of this battle to accept this challenge.
The recent study of more than 2.000 universities showing the symptoms of depression has found that if the patient has a sufficient number of friends "in normal nature", the opportunities for treatment are devastated.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the round of both healthy friends decreases the possibility of mental disasters.
But, of course, to work with friendship, primarily to be it.
In the time when communications are managed by networks when the style prefers containing, the speed of response is often higher than the content of the contact.
Our Digital Life excites the need to seem to be a strong, loving pleasure and successful, even if the unity is in reality.
Such superficial success depends on the fact that psychologists call for external values - money, image, status, all of our internal prices, our internal desire to personal growth and friendship, which affects our mental health.
And as one recently noticed, the video player, you don't buy any more happiness for money.
The worth of Friends is that they have attached this attention.
Each of the persons was determined not by his own, but more than by the person that was in community with friends.
Yumore Joey and Chandler's continuous volumes, the moments of the football review on adequate chairs, the Ross refusal on Rachel -- all comes from understanding that men can feel it, even if they are often exhausted from the full investigation of their feelings.
As the Samaritans said to me, "...my role of listener for people who feel depression and feel upstanding underscores how even the smallest community of friends can benefit."
Many men who turn to us often feel not able to talk to friends.
An old learning of "living with this" is very much as the feeling that a manifest about problems can be taken into consideration as well as the ability.
Friends one of the shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to work more longer overcome mechanisms.
It emphasized the few moments of a man’s friendship.
What I do is doing is the status of the external talking on the phone, which helps people at the time of discouragement, the long-term support and the closer circle of family and friends.
If you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central in these outcomes, where you have completely restored decorations for the holiday, why don't you take your friends to drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see a single man in Starbucks, let's laugh and say "Hello."
No longer think of the benefit of friendship.

Di Maria's kidding the naked by helping "P.J." to disgrace "Malmo"
Anhel di Maria, like the Neighbourhood of Matthew and Edison Kawani, celebrates murdered balls at Malmoi gate.
Anhel di Maria, debutting at the Champion Lige, killed the naked one that allowed "PZ" to easily run "Malmo" on Tuesday.
This is the report on the cat and the reaction of the game.
Anhel di Maria and Edison Kawani did their business when "Paris San Jerman" started their game in the Champions Lige with extremely favourable winning 2:0 against Malmoi at the Park de Prence stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria killed the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the Champions Lige as a player of the "PJ" to set the direction to the French campaigns, but they lost a whole number of minutes before they finally increased their privilege when Kawani killed the naked for 61 minutes.
In addition to Real Madrid and Shather's daughter in the group A, "Pari" had to take a good start in the game against Sweden campaigns, because they were inclined not to play-off, but to continue a series of successful games in the last three seasons, where they were up to four finals.
They had pointed out, but there was not the best decision by Loran Blan to consider the Golden Ibrahimovich demon in the attack and later replace it on the field in the game against a team from his family city and the club in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"This is not easy to win houses or guests in the Champions Life, so that we can gain a victory with count 2:0, to provide problems to the opposers and to play a good game in the protection, it is a good start, even if there are more moments we need to take for the season," said Blan.
It's a lot of promise.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I'm sorry we didn't kill one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovich returned after a trauma in one of the replacements of a Paris team, which brought her a noise with two and two in the "Bordo" in the first line to the outcome, but took him to the back of the De Mary for a fourth minute.
The Argentinian attacker was noted as a player capable of bringing "PSI" to a new level in a month after he was solved in the Manchester United, and he proved why when he fled from Marko Verratty behind the protection of Malmeo and finished the attack by sending a ball over Johan Willand to the distance of the gate.
However, if someone expected the "PSI" to be easy and big winning, they had to be disappointed.
"Malmo", who won Seltic in play-off to reach this stage, having nine world players at the beginning of the game, five protectors and two opposition protectors in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But except the hit of Nicholas Jurdzich, where the ball passed over the nearest sticking gate of Kevin Trapp for the 34th minute, they're an attack a little bit.
Thus, the PSH has sometimes been undergone by non-excellent transfers and attacks, especially by Ibrahimovich, who only in the first half had not been able to make at least five tentatives, and then did not get about the ball killed by the Kawai after the renewal of the game.
Nevertheless, he showed himself much more skillful in precise pastures, and it was a dog from Ibrahimovich, having received him, De Maria, sent a foot with a frozen struggle, who passed to the stamp outside Viland for 52 minutes.
The second naked was killed after a hourmark by the Kawani, the Uruguay killed his sixth ball at the season after Ibrahimovich had sent the ball sent to the centre of the field with the left floor.
This ended with any ideas that had the "Malmeo" returning to the game, and only the capture of Willand's ball on the near distance did not allow David Louis to increase the account before Ezekiel Lavesis was replaced.
Age Harayde's trainer later admitted that the PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our game in the Champion League was in December of the past year."
We just played in the Swedish ligue, not that level.
Kwal doesn't have enough.
Thanks "Paris"!
It was a wonderful bitch with them.

News Economy − Nobel's laureat: Globalization
The printing of the globalization processes should have contributed to the decrease of inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation seems different, the difference in the income of the population in the development of economy, in contrast.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-qualified slaves, considering the main scientific laboratory for analysis and choice of decisions of the UNECE, the Laureat of Nobel Economy Price 2007, Eric Maskin.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced a short growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become more open.
Globalization of the prognoses have great benefits for economic development.
"And these predictions have occurred in many ways," highlights Maskin.
For example, China and India have received a serious growth in the PIB for the population.
However, it is not all so happy.
It was expected that globalization would reduce the loss between the "best" and the "involving" countries in poor countries, which appeared in great income inequality, and more precisely the payment of work.
But in fact, this inequality was just increased, noted by Eric Maskin in its article "Why does the world of the market not reduce the inequality in the development of economy," replied in the World Bank Economic Review, translated and quoted by NYE.
In combination with the economy, Professor Michael Cremer Eric Maskin, of the Harvard University, repeated an alternative theory that demonstrates the increase in income in poor countries as a globalization growth, the UNECE reminds.
Specific processes occur on the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, the Maskin is assigning four levels of stakeholders - A and B for rich countries, C and D for poor.
Following the globalisation of D stakeholders from poor countries, there is no need to cooperate with A and B specialists from the rich countries.
And if the level C of the poor countries is payable by cooperation with the B of the riches, D growth does not feel the payment of them at all.
The resulting effect that internationalization of production will contribute to increase the breakdown in the payment of work between two categories of experts in poor countries and the respective increase in the level of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskinami have been proposed a wonderful beautiful model, an alternative ricardic theory of comparative benefits.
It allows it to explain why globalization has led to income inequality, - says Fuad Aleskers, the director of the International laboratory for analysis and choice of decisions, the Department of the Mother of NYU.
And as a powerful theory, I am sure it will lead to the inflammation of the pyricals in this area.
The problem, according to Eric Maskin, is increasing the level of education of low-qualified slaves.
However, as the scientist notes, it does not have any means, but it is unfair to the companies to pay their training.
In such situations, governments, NGOs and private funds may play a significant role.
The Scientist notes that, once the theory has been made, it does not call for the rest of the globalization process that brings and brings its fruits in the form of growth in the countries.

The Commer designates the National Green Court (NZT) - a judicial authority established in 2010 in order to stop the extreme environmental pollution in the past decades.
At that time, the Court was able to consider more than 10 000 air pollution, the collection of the mushrooms, geological times, waste and damn building.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
Incredibly high: In the past 60 years, India has been converted from the country of virgin jungles into one of the most vulnerable and corrupt world countries since it was announced the independence of industrial development.
It is particularly difficult for major megapolis, where the development of infrastructure does not contribute to streaming urbanization: cities covered with fleshly figs, rivers filled with pesticides and waste of business and households, and a few remaining resident masses are exhausted under the construction of new living quarters.
Despite the formal support of green movement by the State, the NZT regulation is critically criticized by the Government of Narandra Mody, as it is often the main cause of the cancellation of major investment projects.
Yes, in May this year, the Ministry of Environment called the decisions of the Court "External" and "incomplete".
Sometimes the decision of the Court is not really able to comply with the period set by the court, confirming that Raj Pandžwani's environmental issues.
However, incomplete depths have a local side: at least they make responsible persons shift.
"His main goal is to renew this system," adds.
The Green Court has recently cancelled the major buildings: in its account the construction of airport, electricity and hundreds of smaller supports.
In this regard, people are also trying to not forget: for example, during the discussion of the pharmacist of the company in the Tellagnan State, which has contaminated the ftorium river.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for economic consequences.
"People lose" is a proposal for their decision Kumar.
However, such explanations are not always far to understand in individuals who can change their lives through one rash of the court.
Thus, in April, the Court decided to prohibit all vehicles over 10 years of carrying into the capital than the public exemption.
Despite the rare falling population of criticism and criticism, Swater Kumar refused to cancel this decision.
Instead, he proposed to the Government of the Parties statistics on the incoming and traveling transport, and proposed to buy 10 000 additional buses, with a preliminary knowledge of the factory if they were able to carry out such orders.
Since in the case of the court's attention, the people ' s anger started at least to rest, such as the softs, fuel calamity and even the road accidents.
However, the most painful theme of the principle judge was a Hang River Cleaning Programme, announced by the Prime Minister of Naredro Mody last year.
When it comes to Hanga, who is dedicated to the Hindus of the River, the judge often stops to hold his emotions and goes to cry.
Do you know what the word "healing"?
Someone has cast out water from Hang to God, and there is a foolishness in it, and the judge is heavy.
You're continuing to disturb the river because you think it's Hang, he'll be for all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
The Hanga's discipline is the most valuable and precious environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of bacteria in this river exceeds the standard over 120 times.
Each year, from 1.5 to 3 million of 700 million people die from infectious diseases.
In February, Naredra Mody even met Barak Obama and 455 more items from his personal collection in the Sunday.
The Ecclesiastes accused the Prime Minister of Population: Cost was buyed for $700,000 while at least eight billion is required to clean the river.
The Parties of the Green Court have the fact that India must go along with another way before it can be called the developed country, but they do not believe that the price of environmental progress should be.
"In the developing country, environmental environments are often viewed as an inappropriate roast," says the activist of the "Calls of Ganga" of Malka Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find the golden center between environment and development."
