Parliament did not support the new liberating Timothy
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament refused to reject the new section of the criminal law, which was sentenced by the leader of Julia Timoschenk's opposition.
The adjustment that would open the road to freedom of the expremier, the lawyers rejected the second reading of the penalty for economic offences.
The timechank was sentenced in October to seven years of procedure for the closure of a particularly inadequate combined with Russia on the purchase of land gas.
The sentence is not authorised, the revocation of the sentence shall be judged in the court.
The Court of Justice refers to a sentence for the political mixture of the regime, the suspicion of the court's advice also on the Western.
The vote of 147 sentences supported by the submission of paragraph 365, on which the terms were sentenced.
His approval needed 226 votes.
Libya Victory
History of Libya's freedom, or of Libya's rebellies, which has already been hurt.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the wilderness and without it is after the war.
It's still to define wins.
As in the country, in the elections of winning islamics, it is about whether to die or radical.
The Transitional National Council has noted the general law of Sharia, and we have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the hand is cut off for the furnace.
Women can forget the emancipation, the caseless waste from the faith is waiting for the correction and the same way.
Instead of the person of the dictator, it will be the company who is a member of the subsidiary tribes to join the core.
In Libya there will be a order that we can't imagine and which they certainly didn't want.
Only because our way of life is not even the only or objectively best, and it would soon not be necessary for changes to the Libyan mentioned.
In fact, it's amazing that the Islamic fighters have taken thanks to the unbelieving dogs.
The only thing is that, from their view, the Nato-General from America did not lead to the attacks, but Allah, whose size was celebrated at each of them.
So when the winners are looking for in Libya, the west does not belong to them.
We participated in the cross-border, served Islam, and our politicians in the person of the dictator have dismissed a political association, without a benefit.
After the fresh bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq of Libya, we are not soldiers.
This fall is a problem with the outcome of cross.
But will they have without the occupation of the farm company for the defect of the Libyan black gold?
Perhaps enough and west will finally be able to glorify the unusual protection of human rights.
So that will not prevent us from rejecting the laws of the Sherry.
It starts a new era of crisis.
France and the rest of Europe have been searched for investors
The statistical breakdown passed through Europe on Wednesday.
The individual States have published data on the BDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy stagnated interquartally, Germany and France grow.
The long-writing market, but today, it's a record.
Investors do not see merely Italy, but also Spain, France, Russia and other.
The statistical authorities of the Euro, Germany, Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published preliminary reviews of economic development for the third quarter.
The German BDP increased by 0.5% expected, France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, where Germany was better than expected (in 0.3% ratio instead of 0.1%), therefore France stated that it had been decreased in a small decrease of 0.1% (the data were discussed on stagnation).
The Czech economy in the third quarter of the year increased by 1,5 per cent.
However, intermediately, the brutal domestic product (HDP) stagnoused and, according to the CSU, confirmed the trend of gradual delaying the growth of economic performance.
The results are worse than the analysis tests.
The most important events:
The Czech economy in the third quarter of the year increased by 1,5 per cent, but was stagnous in the middle of the year.
The German economy in the third quarter, according to the preliminary and seasonally counted data, increased by 0.5 per cent.
The euro economic and the European Union between July and Seventh against the previous quarter increased by 0.2 per cent, which is in accordance with the expectations of analysis.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 percent.
Its 10-year-old duplications are 28.45%.
The wine of Italian and Spanish debt grows to critical borders.
Problems begin to feel also Russia, Netherlands, France, France, and...
Venuses in the 10-year-old Czech debt are under 4%, even though the decreasing in the region is worse.
From Germany it sounds that the ECB should be the believer of the last instance.
The Czechs were worth EURO.
In Black Mount they won 1:0 and celebrated the procedure for 200 million
Football representation was the most difficult task of the season!
In the Black Mount and thanks to the beautiful Czech and the beautiful Peter Jirack wined 1:0.
The Czech Bal, with a great happiness portion in the second half, has increased the luxury spring from home carrying and again missing the European championate.
IHNED.cz followed the procedures in the detail reporting.
No excitement in the first half and a great happiness portion in the second.
The Czech representation and thanks to the home dead in the constitution, the great Czech and the Hero of Jirack wined in the Black Mountain with happiness 1:0 and celebrated the procedure for the mystery of Europe.
Czech total precise defense of the Black Horse has been taken into pressure until the second half time.
The travellers became Damjanovit and the Vucinic, who burned two great chances.
Even thanks to the wonderful Peter Czech, the presentation or the next year of the mistership of Europe is so strictly lacking in the foreign Bale of Europe, and the reward of about 200 million crowns is also added to the foreign billion.
Since introduction minutes, a lot of fighting balls has been played.
Both teams were only hardly involved in the combination and played mainly around half line.
The pressure of the homebalists, even in the first half, did not come, a long payment for the defence of the Czech defence was exactly refused.
Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear programme of their country.
They created a living shield
Some hundred high schools created a living shot around the nuclear object in Iran.
They want to express support for the nuclear programme of their country before the possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed on Wednesday in front of the object and then caused the death of the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students universities in Iranian Isfahaan created a living shield around the Isfahan nuclear centre in which uran is processed on Wednesday.
It shows that they are ready to protect the nuclear programme from their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Agency for Atomic Energy (MAAE) noted that Iran did not stop striving for nuclear weapons.
Perhaps an attack on the Iranian nuclear equipment is spoken in Israel.
Students prayed in the midnight before they entered the Isfahanian nuclear object and then caused the death of America and Israel.
In the case of an attack, which would be the most protecting of the Iranian nuclear program, the Israelite pressure would also be, in addition to the Isfahan Centre's goal, the equipment in Natan, in which the uran is embraced.
Baby's eating: doesn't eat and dinner
More than a third of children in 9 to 13 years have overweight problems, while the overweight is 9 percent of schools and 5 percent of children.
Instead, obsessional children seem from a family with unhealthy life, as showed the current investigation.
It is revealed how important it is for the healthy development of a person that grows in, and with which it is circumcised.
For example, on boards in obsession children are discovered up to half more frequent than in family children with normal weight.
The remote game had a dinner day before research connected with a world action named Obezita, there is no case more than 19 percent of the obsessions.
There is also no advantage of sporting in the families, but the family of today’s schools - only 15 percent of children replied that their parents would find time for active moves at least once a week.
Research between 900 children
The investigation was conducted at the end of the school year, and 900 children from the basic schools from all Czech Republic participated in it.
It was the second annual Action of Obezita, not a result that supports the General Health Insurance and the Unilever company.
More than 12 thousand students from 4 to 8 classs have been involved in the project.
The proper feeding and adequate movement in the family is, however, one of the specific factors that cause a dramaticly growing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the questioned, for example, stated that it was five times daily in the dinner-sweeking-sweet-sweakina-dinner, which is one of the basic conditions of the right survival," sounds one of the results of the investigation.
No breakfast and dinner
Experts note that related details are essential for health development, including a regular time for family eating.
At the same time, in Czechland only 23 percent of the school family are fed.
In the majority of the family, everyone eats itself.
And the worst was the discovery that in tens of households it doesn't eat at all.
Saturday, however, is the basis for the right daily food.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obsession children, many more often consume unhealthy games.
Almost every - without weight - drinks sweet limonate every day (70 percent).
Although regularly sports more than 40 percent of children concerned, their parents were less than half - 15 percent.
Build your cocktail.
Another part of the research has enabled the selected child (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compose from the offered options of their own eggs according to their own lusts and views.
"The Training Preferences of Czech Children in 12 to 15 years in view of healthy survival far to ideal."
Among their favorite foods are a lot of mild, massive and sweet food.
"The alarming is, in particular, a great pleasure of sweet limonates," it states in the final report to investigate.
For dinner as the main food, the tessovins won closely over the river.
Children, however, haven't wanted bullets at all, and they're low to fish and southern green foods.
Health reasons
The investigation also showed that children are willing to modify their food habits if they have the right information.
"In the control group of investigators who fulfilled the questionnaire after the end of the Ozecita translation, there was no incident, in a number of cases, a significant movement of the preferential towards the principles of healthy survival," it states in the following project.
For example, it was marked in sweet limonates, where more children would begin to give the advantage of the usual water.
Children also more frequently cut off in the questionary of the river and fish as the main eating day, and they would be limited to sweet food and kidneys.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, a strong professional
In the introduction article on how the teachers are learned, I had so little to realize that it was a lot in the early hours.
I didn't know what it would follow.
Three teachers from the staff, dressing problems and seminar about how it goes to the place.
And it'll be worse.
As close to the final test, more information and practical tasks are waiting for us.
And even if the course takes place every Sunday and Sunday, it's actually found.
This time, we and the director Allenka have discussed (in the course there is no only boy) how to dress a woman who has no perfectly proportional position.
And these are the overwhelming.
Someone's got a short worm, someone's a boy's position without a rational crystal, and someone's wearing it again.
Stylist must consider how optics to decrease the wide rams, extend the ring or add the needed curves.
We got types like Jennifer Lopez's women, so the bigger breast and the sides and the weak bed, and I'll be nice to highlight and not to clothe the woman too excitingly.
For example, it is a division between the piece and the sides that it doesn't seat the bottles or the bottles, and then it will be paid to let at least one such piece of peace.
You will certainly not be sorry because the perfect falling clothes are to be unpaid.
You will feel much better in a peaceful shot than in a that keeps moving you, complies, stays in the past and similarly.
The boy's law may be allowed to wear clothes with rubbers, emblems, heights or collections again.
Such information and types of position are, of course, a lot, so I think I'm sure I've got the whole week to get all the information in my head.
And I'm also afraid that because of the given home job, it's too far.
Each of the cursists has received an added celebrity that is to find two outfity: daily and evening.
We need to take into consideration the current view, modesty and type of position.
I'll be clothing Mirand Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the spirit, I'm sure, personally better for me than the Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who may last have taken a hundred kilo (see, please, in the coast) or the younger Selena Gomez.
We have to keep clothes out of the magazines or search on the Internet and print and check graphical processing.
Moodboard, as it is said to the whole output, then it will draw up our personal and relation to the graphical creation.
Think of the graphical page is also important.
The stylist is not only clothing physics, but also produces such product pages in magazines (for specific tasks, such as cabs trends, cabs apod.).
He told us that the artist and the companion of Mario Kamennik.
But it's on Sunday.
List of styles must have a general review
Saturday presentation with information about the types of positions, three guests from the board were strained immediately.
Stylelist Honza Powerful, Modern Jacob Polanka and Modern Photograph Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that the mode is illusion, and the guardian should be able to use it.
And the chickens can work with one cup of clothes differently.
Variability is key in this case.
So you may have such a piece (or if you want pênly trenchcoat) can be wearing classic through the jungle and trick as a plaster, but you can also dress it on a hot body, clothing the ships and photographing as clothes.
Or it's enough to cut hands or limes and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he highlighted.
But mostly, I assessed the following advice: "You know the rules perfectly to work."
"So you can start breathing them," said Jacob.
So I'm finally sure why we're losing all the lessons that we're combining with, why, even in the modern magazines of leckdy, we see something else.
You don't even talk about overviews.
Thanks to the photographer of Ben, I know again that the artist has to have a much more variety of clothes than how many they go.
So in the fashion of story that will have ten pages (and ten outfits), I have to be ready to "build" at least 15.
And also that the clothing looks and works in combination with other cups of leckdy fully different than in the ability.
So we have to calculate when creating outfit.
That the image and ́l do leckdy until half success, Honz humiliated us.
It's enough to look at Madonna, which is not just a wonderful song, but image and marketing from her made a world old.
In Czechland, access to services is more cold.
Even the famous faces of the leckdy think it's inevitable (but it's enough for me to know something, how I look like it is secondary).
And if anybody leaves us to create a ling from us, then we have to calculate that, with great probability, he gives us a totally different (small) size than he really has.
Then there is no more than google and find out if the bullshit has not written that the celebrity is given towl/zubla and similar.
Honza and Mario put our heart on Sunday that the list will be able to guide himself in the mode and to make outfit.
In his work, he communicates with people clothing, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
The ability to consider people, not invite themselves, stand by your own opinion.
"When a guardian is charged with you to broke her and fill her with a nice cup, you can't cut out the whole box and say, God, that's a fright."
"Find at least a few things you praise and recommend what you can wear," said Mario.
He also showed us specifically what everything needs to contain such a "player" or a packet on place.
It's the one you'll set around the pass and you've got all the properties you need.
Furthermore, there are sillon nit (such as cabs or clothes), special clips with which we draw back the clothes if they are more (supply or other weights are not allowed, they would damage the clothes), or a cow.
And they didn't just listen, but they also tried something practically, we learned how to follow the bottles correctly.
Even when you are focused in the athlete, where the surface is equal, the pool could be hurt, so outside.
So we were beautiful and nice.
We can't touch or touch the bottles so that they don't hurt.
It is therefore needed for reality.
Mario rejoiced me when my building praised without exception.
It's not my friend.
This is just a little break of what we heard about the second weekend course.
It starts to be more like it's that to get a professional ling at reality level, it's not a walk of a rose sad, whatever anyone wants to say what he wants.
In Need for Speed: The is driven over the whole America.
Reviews
P's unprecedented driving changes into the routine wound of the road to the thickness because of a series of unusual ladding errors.
Although the ambition could be filled in a significant way, it was nothing worth when no one was obviously wanted to do anything else.
The new share with the subtitle The's builded before issued high expectation.
He promised that the Need for Speed's flying series will move a lot again in a new direction and from playing shows appeared as a game that would not only have to be at the number in the genre of action.
We were also aware of the impact of the passports in which the main herd will come out of the car and run after its own.
But as in the NFS series, many are in the outcome a little different than we were waiting.
These are potentially valid arcade bathrooms, but the whole is drawing down a number of undesirable errors that occur in the series at least a few years.
So it's not even a mistake, but more evidence of an incomprehensible deal of developers.
Wellness starts very well.
You are listed in the story, whose main hero Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is offered in an illegaal bathroom throughout America.
You're going to sit on the West Coast of San Francisco, and your job is to come first to New York.
The thinking with you takes a couple of interesting elements.
The trace is divided in ten steps, and then on more than fifty travels.
This shows that each carrier is going to other traits and that the stages are placed in different, quite different and interesting.
Man doesn't even feel that the game would still offer the same thing.
Moreover, some of the ≥ are very beautiful in view, although the technical level of the graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So that's nothing worldwide.
But the driving outside the wilderness, the underground country or high in the necked mountains works visually very pleasant.
Moreover, the seeds have been deteriorated from time to time with non-typical elements.
For example, in the wilderness, you get into a sand storm that decreases significantly the visibility.
In contrast with that in the mountains, you must take care of it again so that you don't have a lavine.
In addition, they're very good for themselves.
There's just a few types of them, but it's enough.
You are trying to take a requested number of supplications (in principle classic travel), then you get time again (classic confusion with steps) and then you must be waiting for a dual with only opposite.
You're still going to be the police, who's still disappointing all your efforts.
News are passengers outside the car.
It's just about such interactive animation when Jack's heading before some hair and you have to help him in so that you're trying to print the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It surprises, however, that these passports are much less than you would wait (only even three).
In the outcome, however, it is for the benefit of the thing, because this element does not have chance to become anxious, and in the context of the above, it is so related to the elements that the game rises.
The external model is on the tracks of the previous parts.
That means that it's no longer any more today, but it's not to say it's a disaster.
You're looking for realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But more effectively comprehensively, the leader model now still speaks very well, although they have been able to find better in competition.
So that's all in full order.
But the problems begin to come on at the same time.
For a distance from the model of the railway, it's not a cool model.
From this type of game, we don't expect it to calculate complex deformation and colise, but if practices before any time in any object you don't have the least idea how your car is stored, then it's probably not all right.
Typics at the heavy preference or change of cars in the running operation sometimes you will only easily olive each other, but otherwise identifying will end your car in wild pirates.
Or even an attack.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't hurt especially, but it's going to disturb you.
Restarts are resolved so that if you are disturbing or getting far out of the trace, you'll be able to play a game from the game to the last mysterious point on the trace.
But the restarts are only five in each train.
When you get them out, you have to start the train again from the beginning.
So it's more like a help for the case that there's nothing going to happen than you could be able to express them.
Sometimes, though, even restarts will not help, they will be resolved until it is necessary to learn the part of the divorce to remember.
The big accident of the game is that the same things are often embraced in the same places.
Some points, for example, require a project in a specific way, otherwise you won't get into them shortly.
Otherwise, you will meet the "civil" vehicles in the same configuration or you will come there first, five, five seconds ago or a minute later.
It is particularly in the cases when you see between two anti-going cars the opposite will easily go before you, while when you come there, the vehicles are already in a position that you have to run or accelerate them.
It's anxiety when you come to them because it's "contaminated" so that it comes to the Danemark closely before your nose.
The opposers have another advantage.
All the time you play will reach a number of places where you, notwithstanding the time, will be the same support in the same place.
It's most likely to pull at the end of the game on a long pool where you're going in the opposite.
The opposite must be there before you, probably, for any price.
When it goes before you, it's worse to you over the anti-eating vehicles, so you're about a few times nicely spread there.
You can understand the intention to make the game more swift and adrenalino, but performing is so obvious that it will constantly disturb you.
And it's damage, because even through a simple driver model it's playing fun and places and so much action that sometimes you're not going to see where it is flying.
And it's in principle a matter of whether it deserves a concept with fifty unique traces, a set of travels so that the nud is not a chance or anything else.
An untraditional idea is the exchange of cars during the trains.
You need to take care of the benzin pumps at the road because you can change the car right there, although in the most cases you'll get enough with what you just have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Companys are suitable for urban areas, strong American bullets on equivalent distances and exotic supersports for technical feeding, for example by clicking on mountain roads.
With the main history regime, the hands are in the hands and the challenge mode, which are travels in individual locations you know from the history.
Here you get not only medal, but also experience points in your profile, which is common for challenges and stories.
To get the higher level of drivers, different objects are removed: starting cars and ends with profile backgrounds.
It is also reconnected with the Autolog online, which, otherwise, compares your achieved outcomes to other players and provides further communities.
One of the other hardly comprehensive baths is the last bathroom in the history.
With your car, you will get into the tunnel of a metro (beep), where you marry it in darkness in the rows (wake).
At the tachometer, you have numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (buying) and in the back it will adjust the meter fixed and uncomfortablely disturbs you.
In the editor, we're likely about a few days to be discussed about whether anyone really thinks about the creation of the game, or whether the authors have us to be so stupid.
The technical page of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall viewpoint is very pleasant in most cases and in some cases even great.
He's freezing so that in some more drinking moments, it's tragic enough, and in some cases.
But it seems to be primarily a bullet with a higher number of photographers when you're not going to be worth anymore.
The sound page is okay and soundtrack is a question of smile.
In trying to appreciate what the widest scales rather than the younger public has shown soundtrack from the category "Every dog other ves", but it is supposed that because of listening to music games, it is likely just so to buy somebody.
Total income from Need for Speed: The is so deceived.
The game would make a completely unusual error, then they don't worry to say that The's the best part of the NFS in the past few years.
But that's how the game works unalloyedly.
Funny is certainly good, but get ready to make mistakes in your eyes with the power of aeroplane reflectors.

Highlights at EU Vicen:
Czech has the story of negativists and euro skeptics
"Lisboa's compliance has adequately distorted the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a strong war."
"It will take five, six years before the responsibility is a little sleeping, calm, and before all players will be used to their new role," she started her speech at the Czech University of Czech Highlights at the European Union Milena Vicen.
As its "Compliant and comprehensive to Europe" motto is serious, it has already shown in the first part of the proposal when it has been able to describe the EU’s individual authorities and their relations in such a transparent and comprehensive way that it may be able to obtain a number of transferred from the UK Rights Factory.
Vicenna also appreciated the work of the new continuous President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuye:
"Now the criticism appeared that it's unexpected that it's a green officer that it cannot fill any role, and I have to say that the breath has expressed all that the role has been excited greatly."
"It is a person who can listen to the twenty-seven Member States, to communicate well with them and has a vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of the High Representative for Employment and Security Policy explained as an answer to the question, "Who is this European Union? Who is the phone number to call?", thus as a significant step to join and more readable Union policies against States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to prohibit our pockets
The vice-president also lives and will live in the nearest time to the agency of the European Council.
The Preliminary Czech Presidency has been marked for success.
The Czechs resolved the future financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis or organized the summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The dead government at this time signed as a great negative, which was very harmful to the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very strong.
The words "factory" were not only the presidency but also the following financial crisis, which will be resolved to this day.
Moreover, the new seven-year budget of the Union must be approved, which is very complicated because of the current economic situation.
Whether the screening and sustainable budget that will receive the sector a privilege that countries will be supported more and less, it is all in the order of the next negotiations.
She also reminded her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "The Europe is comprehensive."
"I really don't have a worrying shortcut, a strange word, a crap that no one understands.
How the citizen should understand that the truth is not intended in Brussels to be crossed or cut, bananas differently large, or that somebody really needs to prohibit the poor."
He also wants to use the EU and get more Czech in European institutions.
We're waiting for more Europe
According to the highlight, the Czech Republic has the story of euroscapes and people who are more interested in the negative than positive pages of things.
Moreover, it hates the low representation of the Czech Republic in European institutions.
There are factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their incapacity to write motivating letters, but also low support from the Czech Republic.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she raised the force and cooperation of Visegrad Fourth.
"Rely on me, when Polish and Hungary comes after me and comes near Slovak, the French will say to me, "Hey, what are you coming there, what is your Visegrad four?" and it doesn't be surprised."
In the future of the Union, according to the vice-people, the new firm rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States are mainly expected.
As a very real then, it has a concept of two, unless more Europe is, rather than the new "European Federation".
"We have the euro country and the euro country."
"We have a Schengen space, we have a strong cooperation institution."
"The first is said that they should cooperate only the lands that they want, and those who do not want to stand up."
"The institutions will be more and it will be strongly two Europeans," expects Vicenna.
In this regard, she also assessed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in the processing of the principle in which all the subjects affecting the whole Union are to negotiate between all Member States, not only among the euro countries.
Brand story:
IBM Innovator starts the second century of its existence
If someone looks for a word that is most accurately expressed by the IBM strategy, it would probably be "language".
For a wide public, IBM is a symbol of the revolution, it is a company very modern, and yet has been a hundred years ago since it's been laid down.
The foundation of this was placed by the first boss of the company, vice-president Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He has already dealt with the password that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His password "Think!" became an impression, where the life of the future gigant (and also the name of the internal magazine that IBM began to grow in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson’s carefully built fermentary culture.
"For us from IBM means a continual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered hundred years because she remained aware of its basic values, and then she did not fear to change all the rest around herself.
This allowed us to transform the business, and the company during our first century.
We hope that we can achieve more in the second hundred," Samuel J. Palmisano's annual director.
Processed system
Watson accessed to care of his employees as a businessman in Czechland - people from IBM had as one of the first American employees payable allowance, assurance from employees plus an elegant employee uniform and a worked system to reward the best finders and businessmen.
It also has the IBM opportunity and the link to the customer.
The company was from the beginning genial in deploying talents - as one of the first world fires cancelled any discrimination, so she could choose it.
In accordance with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisan in the face of IBM is a woman - Virginia Rometty in the next year.
The IBM has already acted for thirty years, still remains the position of the boss of sales, marketing and strategies.
IBM has been making such calls, online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations are developed.
It's not surprising that ideas are enough -- in the company it works almost half a million people.
Institute with a good name
A firm position in business ensures the company its strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had more institutional concepts than only the company," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of the book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a company, but a company that helps solve business problems for use," added George Colony from the Forrester Research conference company.
As the company itself says, it's the division between incoming on the market and the market to create it.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it comes to her log in the United States, in a hundred years she has grown into one of the largest fires of the world.
It is obviously the most amazing company - develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and conserving services in the rock of products from servers after nano.
He holds the most patents from all American fires and its five employees gained Nobel's price.
Its findings include bankomates, payment cards, financial swap, chain code or disket.
IBM was about 220 billion dollars this year, the second largest company of market capitalization (by Apple), when Microsoft was first presented since 1996.
Forward View
Not all products and innovations traveled to customers and times - for example, IBM did not have a demand on its own operating system OS/2, on-line Prodigy service or IBM PCjr computers.
"When your business is set to move forward, you can't be emotionally touched by the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms - and if they don't work, let them go.
To the extent of the competitive Microsoft, which is in principle standing and falling on the Windows operating system.
Perspectives
On the IBM markets, the largest measurement of service is, after approximately five is a software and hardware.
At the same time, in 1990, he was more than half the strongest hardware representative.
Since 2000, the IBM sold a small amount of $15 billion, and invested $58 billion in the purchase of perspective.
The investment has also continued since 2008, when the new financial crisis has overcome the first world.
IBM refers to his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the large economic crisis.
It seems that the IBM is currently insufficient to the crisis.
The price of the IBM action since the beginning of 2008 was 120 per cent of rackets, the pure profit of the company continued to grow.
The fire password IBM is to change everything, but not its values.
That is why it can be expected that, even if the next crisis comes, this flexible gigant will be able to make it possible.
History IBM: From the crew of the syrs to the universe
IBM (International Business Machines) appeared in New York a hundred years ago, with a complex name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name of IBM was taken up to 1924 — a label used for a company in Canada and South America.
The IBM was based on the four-four flights of the history of the nineteenth century.
They owned it as a "speaks", so the hours of employees' income and department.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presidented the supervisory Council in 1930.
Flint bossed the competitive company Thomas J. Watson to help him carry out the company.
The leader then shaded the IBM founder - on Watson's thoughts has yet been set up an inconsistent fire culture and identity.
Watson led the company up to 1952.
IBM, as she indicates her name, started with the production and sale of all possible machines for business - from the crewers of meat and sire after the stock.
During the first four years that Watson was headed, he doubled up to nine million dollars and started a large expansion of the company into all the worlds.
Watson was so insultable for the company that almost 40 years after his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership, IBM started working on the development of artistic intellectuals, developed the first programming language.
In the sixty years, people and computers from IBM helped NASA drive years into the universe - to Merkur, Saturn and in 1969 a slave year of man for month.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM System/360.
The classic "pececk", which set up the computer standard of the time, named IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
In 20 years later, IBM sold the production of Chinese computers to Lenovo, however, buying a constant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to complete advice and services with high added value.
It is the concept of Smarter Planet, "the smarter planet".
Its goal is to be wisely used in the case of non-planned terms and improvements, for example, in transport or urban management.
For the trade she recently introduced the IBM platform "Smarter Commerce", which helps traders to conduct the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong story in the foreign.
In 1932, she founded her share as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe in the Czech Republic of Czech Republic.
Today, other than the IBM CR also operates a strategy outsourcing center in Brna.
The Centre for Mediterranean and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and there is also a research team of the world levels of recognition of the voice.
An unbelieving husband's farmer:
Iveto, let your ass go, I don't want it anymore!
Darin Richtář (53) said the end!
After her husband Joseph Richter (53), he became not only a protector of Ivety Bartosh (45), but also a loving man, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a red dream and return home.
But now, it's not enough to wait, and in the next life, it's set out rules.
"Papa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," explained the Richter.
When Darin Richterary in the summer azyl of Bartosh in her home, it seems that it doesn't seem to have the end of her marriage.
Although Iveta was moved from Greek after 30 days, Pepa didn't leave the singer.
He even acknowledged publicly that he loved her.
During the time, Darin rejected her husband’s relationship, and now she gave him forever good.
Richters don't care with who his wife sleeps
If the Richter with Bartosh had just disappeared once, his wife's hand was opened home to wait anywhere.
"It's a biological father of my sons, and if he wants to get his life in our common house, no one's going to throw it out."
"It's not like my dear, deceived old axe but as a man with which I have certain relations," the Richter forgave that she has already responded and is only to mutual obedience.
Joseph's being locked by Darin's back door, he's not worried yet.
"I respect the wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and I'm not going to change it."
"The man has set the paper wedding and I respect it."
"The company's going on, I'm looking for rights, garden, immobility, buying."
"Darina and I have a completely normal conversation, just that we don't share the bed together," said Blesk Richter.
If the Richter also finds a new love, she doesn't think she's protecting it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he goes with who he goes and if he has a friend.
I know that it's my fault, I loved Iveta and I'm taking myself all responsibilities," Joseph closed.
Women's worst wounds: Do you like it?
When you ask men if they can appoint such typical female crimes, everyone in one is really quite ready out of the hand.
Honey Women, do you know in the following lines, where are some women's mistakes that can perfectly spare blood in the kidneys?
Buying
Do you think your second half is dependent on the purchase?
Do you have to buy at least one hole a week?
Are you buying a cup and a cup in the springs?
Then, in your case, you can talk about purchasing as a crime.
Some women realize that they should have their purchasing wedding at least a little bit.
But tell me who would just take it into business with clothes, look for good falling objects and then try them all (ideally in different color performances) in the cabinet?
Although for a lot of women buying a horse, men can be a letter to a ready hell.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you before in...
Permanent Insatisfaction
"I'm not too tired?"
"I'd need to lose at least five pounds - I should start practicing?"
"I love you at all?"
Didn't these guys say anything to you?
Yeah?
Then you belong to those women who're under the way they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are alergic to how their partners are still trying to look forward.
The stronger sex is also agreed to increase the frequency of this disorder, the women are more vulnerable.
Order and purity in the first place
It's like an unusual roof.
It washs windows, swimming, swimming, swimming dust, smoking vans - and at least twice a week.
Do you recall the partner that he put his feet on a clean wall, the kid that he spent the thrown wall and washed the wall of a wall that you gave so many jobs?
In the case that you are just suffering this "success", try to realize that nothing should be overcome, and the order and cleanness should certainly not be in the first place of the family.
This unfair desire after purity can threaten your mutual relationships and family conditions.
Snapshot
"The useful trainers go to the waste."
"You're going to take the old feet too tomorrow?"
"The slow fleeting doesn't belong to the ground."
If you're taking a shot in your partner sometimes a day, you'll be able to drive him out.
Of course, you don't think that's bad, you want to get it all right.
Maybe if the men said that, women wouldn't have so much to shoot in them...
Discussion, distress
For some women, there are also their own conversations, chains, but also the rape and association with someone.
Women are focused on relations, so together they consider things like who, where, who, who, who and why.
Maybe everyone of us will leave a little worm or a clothet here.
The hand on the heart, maybe it's his own for all women.
Instead, however, they are the lows of the worst one, which are often driving, maybe they are everyone who is upset and are for their environments - mainly in the women's work collective - especially dangerous.
Jagr and Voraček helped assistants to exhaust Philadel_e
The Hokey attacker Jaromir Yagr participated in the Sunday NHL by two assistants on Philadelité 5:3 on Carolina ice and is again in the head of the productivity of the Czech players in competition.
In view of the ninety-year stars, Giroux was weakened in both cases, which added another record and was announced by the best storage player.
Two assistants in the bathroom also mentioned Jagr's partner Jakub Voraček.
The Jagger, after the sea journalists were thrown, claimed that Giroux had predicted a big evening.
"I told him that he's getting a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes such feeling will overcome you," Jagr explained, after his action Giroux gave you from the first arrow of Flyers.
In a minute later, he had the second principle of the Czech team.
The kitchen struck for the Hurricanes kitchen and presented it between the circles of Maxima Talboto.
A second before the first stop, Patrick Dwyer reduced the weak home player, but the introduction of the second part was Flyers.
Exactly to Giroux.
After cooperating with Jagrem, he shot the third, after his shooting moved the run in Wayne Simmonds fourth.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the lisa, but it's certainly among the best three," he assessed his center.
"I'd never think I'd play with hokeyit like him at the end of my career."
"I'm glad of it."
"I want to play on him."
"All those years in NHL my partners tried to play on me, now it's turning," added Jagr.
Carolina from the bathroom still made a drama, Tuoma Rutua, and again the Duer, who was sentenced by a criminal shot, got to a division of one.
Another complication but did not allow Matt Read, who stopped reading two on one.
"It's prodigal in our Pronger's box."
"I've been driving the kitchen, I've picked up and (Read) went to the remote wheel."
"I've tried to make it, and I'm guess it's been out," he described the last story of his view of Voraček.
Philadel's victory got in the head of the Watchtower.
The Czech Defensor of Montreal Jaroslav Spaček did not gain a battery against Buffala, secondly he departed from the damage in the top of the body.
Candians, near the tested beck, were also lost by double-break leaders and lost after the penal solve 2:3.
One of them hasn't changed Thomas Plekaner.
More than the lost points of the household trainer, the widespread married row of the back, and only five wallets were played.
"It's bad."
"We only played relief with one experimented player, the rest of them were young."
"But it can't soon do anything, we have to arrange with it," said Jacques Martin.
"What we've been able to do is to do with us and we couldn't stop."
"We should have simplified more the game, move a puzzle from our feet."
In that we had spaces," added one of the P. K. Subban defendants.
The Czech American André Pavel contributed to the thirty-countries of Winnipeg to exhaust 5:2 over Tampou Bay.
The Jets, who interrupted the five-scale series of prohibitors, divided five different shooters.
How the prices were developed since 1989
In 1989, only five state travel offices were allowed in Czech Republic: Chedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
The road at that time was sold by officers only to the country of the socialist block because the road to the west was very concerned.
The Czech tourists so traveled on the sea allowed to NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Soci in Chryma at the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (soft to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was possible to travel to Jugoslavia, but then the Yugoslavia regime turned to the West, and the roads of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were therefore very distorted.
The big paradox of socialism was that the citizens of the social stick block (i.e. also the Czech Slovaks) were not allowed to travel individually freely or in the social stick countries.
In the case that the Czech Republic wanted to travel individually to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed a letter from this country, otherwise it was not possible to be individual.
The road of the offices at that time offered to the West, but it was necessary to get a front overnight with a package or to have a "not known" office on the road.
However, it wasn't won.
That is, the devise promise, which was a submining for the road to the West, was not "politically unfounded to people" who could not travel so at all.
The Czech Monetary currency was not a freely changeable currency, and without a devise promise it was not possible to obtain financial (western currency) road to the West.
However, most often, the Czechs traveled in foreign lands, whereas a lot of chat and chalupe that the Czechs had forged, and this habit survives to this day.
The Traveling of the Czechs has lived as a result of the revolution since 1989.
While in 1989 it was allowed in the NDR or Bulgaria to our maximum, Czech flags spent in 4.5 billion allowed countries throughout the world.
The huge paradox that we do not know today is that the most important Croatia has not been possible for us to travel freely until 1989, since it was part of this Yugoslavia.
Immediately in the 1990s of the past centuries, the disruption of visa obligation to the neighbors of Western European countries, which restarted a huge wall of short-term visits mainly in the Russian Western or Germany.
The Czechish speakers couldn't get outlets to Western, at least everyone wanted to look at the choice.
For example, in Paris, the Czech enterprises were burned in parks in apartments because our timely revenue did not allow, and they could pay hotels or pens.
The typical trip of the Czech traveling was at this time the carriage of their own food, conservation, salaams around to protect it.
Another important moment was the introduction of freely changing Czech crowns, which our tourists finally could purchase west currency after many years of decision.
However, our livelihood and the average payments were decreased, which took up about 1997 at another important moment.
Increased requesters have started the road from 1997 regularly preparing the charter aircraft interests, with which the aircraft interests have been enabled to make us a lot of plants compared to the past incrediblely bad.
At the end of the 90th century, the Czech Republic had already a freedom of practice in all developing countries of the world, other than the United States, which further facilitated our traveling.
Another interesting moment in the history of the comparative traveling occurred immediately in 2000, when a significant request was addressed from the Czech Republic of the history the first direct charter year to exotic was to Thailand.
Since this year, with Czech tourists, direct charters to the warm remote countries, the annual winter will fly directly from the CR to twelve exotic destinations.
The exotic countries are currently visiting about 100 000 Czech every year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our comparative development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States dismissed the vision of Czech tourists, and our country was definitively organized between the world's most developing country.
In 2008, the Czech first in history spent more than half of their allowed in the shop (50.3%) and the first in the history spent for one expenditure allowed for more than 15.000 per person.
Valna Hromada must find the president again, but it's dangerous even.
Through five months, the Czech Bal is without the President and threatenes that Ivan Haška, representative of the Fotbal Association of the Czech Republic (FACHR), knows even after another extraordinary Valley Hoom, which will be performed on Thursday in Nymburce.
There is still no agreement in which the election order will be taken.
Without her, it will not be started to vote on what one of three candidates will be chosen.
I'm interested in leading Czech Major Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelt and Tomás.
Hashek rejected on June, and at his department he invited colleagues to join and find a strong personality that would lead to the future.
But in the Earth after Haschbaal, he turned back to the ships between both union rooms that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely shown on September 16, when the new president had to be chosen.
The delegates of the Value Chromes have been unexpected to the National House of Prague in the Smich Chale, because the proceedings have remained locked and have only been taken on the way of choice.
There was no agreement with who has the right to vote at the horse - whether only the statutory representatives or the full-powered credentials.
In this only point, a partial agreement has occurred since that time, which has also helped the recommendation of the Constitution for State and the right to which the representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
But they still rule about the electoral order.
The Executive Committee has not brought too much to it, either the right or the extraordinary, in its negotiations, no longer solve anything else.
The view of the option of choice has changed several times, but the neural point is still the same.
The question sounds: how to walk in the 3th round to deal with the possibility of a patrol?
"The dispute is whether to act in accordance with the definitions or to find another model," observed one of the three FAČR Dušan Svobod presidents, who represents a professional ball in the leading of the association.
According to the provisions of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate who will have more percentage support in the room will be low to the candidate.
Morava is probably willing to go to the procedure to win a candidate that will gain a higher percentage of votes from both rooms.
And the Czech party claims that the victory has to get at least two-third overwhelming in this percentage calculation.
"But then it would have left the meaning of two previous rounds, that would completely disturb a two-common concept," it understands the meetings of the Maritime Party of Liberty, which would be the best order to avoid and choose according to the valid provisions.
In some cases, Thomas also agrees surprisingly, although it is deemed that the electoral order is the most of Pelt's candidates.
"I'd like it to be elected at the maximum according to the prescription."
"In order to avoid thinking of representative misunderstandings like the past valley horror," said the owner Victorie Plzeň, who first candidates, and in his exhibitions, was mainly mixed against Pelt.
The Pelta remains optimist.
The new president in Nymburce, according to him, will know that candidates will cooperate in the future.
"All of them will quietly relax the case of today's national team's procedure for the mistery of Europe."
"Fotball will be again on a happy wall, will be more willing to cooperate," mentions the jablonic factor, which has the most largest experience with the management of balls and at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl's more sustainable.
"I hope in the agreement, but, unfortunately, the deal is very disappointed."
"It's not between people from Czech and Moravia, but there's an effort to adapt the rules."
"It can cause the blocking of the low rocks to happen again."
"And I hope he wins a healthy mind," said Rajchl.
There's no longer a long time for the agreement of all parties.
Some negotiations should have been played directly in the Black Mount, as anyone knows whether the ball generality will be complete in the storage.
The aircraft specialist in which they had to travel to Podgorice, outside the other presidents of Dalibor Kuchera and Rajchl, was not flying from Prague because of the technical disturbance and seeking a replacement variance as part of the Executive Committee to the Barage transport.
Finally, there may be a decision-making meeting at a ministerial level that may be in the centre.
The Ministry of School, Youth and Body Joseph Dobeš would have taken the most strong sports partnership in the country to agreement.
It is a lot in the game: State aid, confidentiality of the Bal and also a Valid CSTV Hromad, which will solve a new coherence of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
He's going to fight the president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If the boss of the Balists Plzne Tomás had seen a strong candidate before an extravagant valley crowd that would comply with all his ideas about the new President of the Fotbal Association of the Czech Republic (FACHR), he would not have been notified in the fight against the top.
"When a quality adept exists, I'm fighting for and I'm not going to choose."
"But for the present time, no one could find such a person," said the TCK.
In the fight against Miroslav Peltou and Jindrich Rajchlem, a woman is motivated to try to avoid the FACHR, just to Pelt, a particular favorite election.
The article also highlights that, in the case of his victory, he would be held in the role of the president only until 2013, when the programme is a valid Value Hromad.
In Venezuela he would have seen an experienced and spice manager, which is not too connected with the ball case.
"I talked to some people who would come into account."
"For me, it was crazy when some said that at this moment they didn't want to identify the Czech Bal."
"That's what I want to change," he said.
Now, mostly, Pelt's connection with the President of the National Union of Plzenian, Roman Berbrem, a man with a controversial story, which is known as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates on the Valley Room.
It's so inacceptable for the carrier that Pelta's standing in the presidential position.
"If he wins, the current state is reserved and nothing would be moved forward."
"In combination with Berbra's support, which is a powerful negotiator, it would not contribute more to the ball," said the deputy.
It also suggests that the name of Pelt was in the poster in the investigation of the corruption affair, but that Pelta went out without penalty.
"I don't know what the Prestibal of Pelt's victory would bring."
"And how they looked also in the eyes of EUFA and FIFA," said the article, which, however, also takes a view of its own claim that "the Plugin Club would sell if Pelta became the president."
If a person triumphed in a quarter choice, he could imagine the future cooperation with Pelta.
It also considers another candidate Rajchl, who was supported by the guardian before the spring of the wallet, which ended with the fiaski.
"He would be the first one I would follow."
"I have great ability."
"I could imagine him as a boss of representation."
"But the manager wouldn't be able to drive a partner."
"I also don't strike the nose where I don't know it," said the cousin, who in September wake a great attention by standing after the call of the Commission of decisions in the face of the Macel, who replaced Dagmar Damk.
The teacher claims that he'd be thrown into a association leadership.
It is revoked to its ability from the management of private fires, and since the past year, Plzni also headed, which, with its support in May, celebrated the primary ligue triumph.
"I have the strength to change something in the balls to contribute to his certain culture."
"In order to limit the effects of some interesting groups, which may have the tendency to influence the disciplinary and revocation committee, which is to be inconscient," said a person who does not have their antipaties, for example, for the Spanish Boss Daniel Christian.
One of the priorities would also consider the estimation of the FACHR relations with the Czech Olympical Committee, with which he would lobby in political spices to gain more money from lottery tax in sport.
"It's one of the key things that the new president should be announced."
"If it comes to a risk as the political parties do, I understand their arguments, but at the same level they have to say where money will go," he noted.
As a complaint now, it doesn't take its association with the Prague Club, whether it himself claims that the FACHR president should be "natural".
Pelta is connected again with the Jablon, Rajchl with the Prague Duklo.
"It's not ideal."
"I don't even see the sense of translating my action to someone in the Prague Club, and in a year and a half, he returned there," he said.
Pelta promised new FACHR statements that would distort optional patts
Two days before the Validad Crossball Association, one of the candidates of President Miroslav Pelta promised that in the case of the election, the FACHR should have new provisions that would definitively distort the electoral order in the future.
The Jabloneca is optimist before the quarter negotiation in Nymburce, and it implies that the preferential battle will significantly deteriorate the eventual success of the Baltic Representative today.
The Pelta has already promised a non-complete choice that it is appropriate to concentrate on the representation and receipt of funds in the case of election.
He decided to go to the last minute before the past valley, so a two-month division could be able to deal with his ideas of the management of the ball and represent in a larger context.
"The people at all levels are doing a lot of balls and expecting the president to be known on Thursday."
"It feels that it's the highest time to lead partners," mentions the man connected primarily to the jablonic club, but who has acted a number of years in Sparte and the Executive Committee of the Union.
It also believes that it has enough experience to be able to conduct the Czech Bal.
It is convinced that for the current issues of election, the Eufory was dominated in the time of Ivan Haska.
"Therefore, on the red valley rocks were approved, not as perfect as they all thought."
"When there were different explanations, we had the president since September," Pelt warned.
The processing of the most important document of the civil Association has been taken as a delegate.
"When I become president, I'll take it as a personal task and I'm willing to take a personal responsibility if it doesn't happen."
"It's the original thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
I think he's still trying not to fight against his opposers.
He had already announced that he could present cooperation with Jindrich Rajchl, who he recognises for his legal education, and well knows that his candidate would be his first president.
He didn't even attack Tomás, who didn't leave Pelt or dry.
"The ball moves something over a year, has been successful."
"But his attacks were inexcusable and a lot of people in the way of the election campaign."
"And therefore, a number of them now doubt about his character," he said against Pelta's address, which seems to remain an unfair advertising that he has announced in September.
His strongest weapons are, according to the knowledge of the ball from the lowest competitions to the representation.
This should be an explanation of the ball.
"And I would also try to finish all the affairs starting with the Bohemians cousin or the doses of the low corruption scandal."
"I'd soon go on negotiating with the private and state sector, and I'd assured enough money for the whole bal," said the CITK sixty-year candidate two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his arrival to the head of the ball would not mean any personal cleaning.
"I should first meet the full of individual employees," he said to the Guardian, where a comprehensive nervousness dominates from long uncontrol.
Throughout the present disaster scenarios, which are being carried out in the Valley Homode, they do not go to delegates to Nimburk on Thursday.
"If it's the only ambiguous point of choosing in the third round, we'll be able to transfer."
"Fotball's confidence, and here it only gets by finally having his leader again," Pelta remains two days before the possible day that decides his career with optimists.
Rajchl promises that the FACHR would start working firmly under him.
If the new President of the Fotbal Association of the Czech Republic on the quarter Valley Room had been chosen by the Prime president of Jindrich Rajchl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his choice, he will work firmly.
He wants to make system changes and take members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual balls.
He also promised to solve Bohemians, improve EUFA and FIFA relations, bring more money to the ball and continue the work that President Ivan Hashek started before.
"As the President, I would like to renew the ball as a whole."
"After international contacts with EUFA and FIFA through representation, professional bal, youth performance."
"I don't say I'd do everything alone," said Rajchl in a conversation for the CTK.
"I'm a team player and I want to share the competence in the Executive Committee so that each member may have some of them."
"And I'm going to give a firm task to move a mile step forward in each segment."
"A lot of people would probably not be happy because it would begin to work true and not only criticize the work of the rest," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the ball movement, he was probably thinking of re-considering the candidate.
"I know I'm doing 20 hours a day."
"But I'll say that it's gonna have sense and that there's no people behind me who'll keep my clocks under my feet and doubt every one of my steps," he explained why he was weakening.
"But many people told me I couldn't give it, because then they would give it to others."
"This is the confidence I can't just reject so," he said.
He's just motivating him to continue in the work he started with Haske.
"For the two years, a big job has been done and I don't want to take it away."
"There are initiated processes that will have a dose for a few years, and I don't want anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that in the case of the choice of another candidate Miroslav Pelty, it would be possible to return a time before Haske.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's what I think Mirek Pelta doesn't think."
"To him are mostly involved people who would do it so that he would only be chosen for those."
"I can calculate a lot of things, but I'm sure not that I'm going to face somebody."
"I'm trying to be objects."
"I want to do a ball for everyone, because then they'll have everybody well and not only you choice," said Rajchl.
He also claims that he is only the Czech president.
"Although some people are trying to claim the opposite, I'm going to make Mora's maximum."
"For example, it's time to think that the second liga would divide into a Czech and Moravia part whose winners would go into the first liga."
"It would not be so modern when only three moral generals are in the lira, which is a problem toward young players in Moravia," said Rajchl.
Since the Chairman of the Tomas Club was involved in the fight against the president, Rajchl does not believe to consider his choices.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech room, which has chosen me to be his president and sees that there is a success behind me," said Rajchl, who considers the safe ten million coroners of injury, the negotiation of television contracts and the lottery law for its success.
On the contrary, it gives it to a partner that the union doesn't go for one cup.
While it states that Pelt is "disposed from returning to the Czech Republic of Confidence", the second of the supporters considers a strong candidate who has a bal what to offer.
"No one can doubt that he took a great job in Plzni for that year."
"When he was chosen, he might have continued in the things Ivan Hashek started here and would not generally change personal occupation in the commissions."
"He wouldn't worry about it in his benefit," he assessed the Rival Rajchl.

Julia Stopek
Browsing from Ufon's view, the relief basen in Budapest: Whoever travels to Europe can enjoy his blue miracle - and after the spectator of cities or travel, let his feet rest in the terms.
The book will show where wellness is in the most beautiful water.
When Iris Meder was released in the past one and a half year on the open road, it was not supposed to miss her duty: her floors.
Leaving a mark on the water, looking at the height of the art of the building cups, floating against the marmor path (building a little naked boy, a child (with wings)), which waited on it on the basen edge and wondered carefully restored season floors.
If a floor loved her, she brought her into her recorder in the knife - and with a careful details about the way of building and the story of the building.
More than 200 soldiers examined this way the historical tecture of Meder and presents them now in the book "Badefreuden (Radost from purchasing)": People's floors in Mnich, historical palace flooded in Schwarzwald, "Fird Nuclear of Beton Building" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "The Road for the most usual lobbys in Central Europe": Near Germany, Russia and Switzerland visited localities in Italy, France, Czechland, Slovenia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year Germany is a real enthusiast of the floor culture.
It doesn't move too much with sport, says Meder -- it's something else in the water.
To rise, it is only that fand floating must be satisfied with blue cocktails and chlores, while runners for health can breathe a wound of the dark woods or listen to the joyful lighting of birds in the park.
"Every day I wondered why actually the floor must be so big," Mrs. Meder says in Vídeo.
"So I started sharing nice floors."
Water level doubles the tecture
So spraying in the Scokane base and etheric oil for sauna is so big that it relates to all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, they could be a floor for the eyes: "There is a man in the water coal."
"There is, however, transparent, but reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is doubled: high clothing, pearl cockles, Scocanian cock.
The Malformation Image Link "Badefreuden (Badfreuden from purchasing)" provides on 190 pages everything you need to talk about historical and cultural oases wellnes, but especially pleasure to go into blue.
The spectacular copies discovered the collector of Ms. Meder's floor at her traveling in Hungary.
Along with beautiful medical lashes, such as 100 years old Shecheny lazzy in Budapest, found water with the contents of dusicnans in the pâ splendid yeskyni (scale lazzy in Miskolc-Tapolca) and the termal lazze, which bases are filled with alkalic water and are placed in the building of the lahve (Városi Termal bidö in Jaszberena).
Beautiful looking against this offers a lot of exhausted floors under the wide heavens in Switzerland and Russia. While a person has from the kirchian frontal bathroom on the eye of the whole city, he can look at the snow covered in St. Anton - and: In the park lazing is a window from which it is possible to watch the movement of the lizard cheese.
Hopefully the most aware design of the basen is expected by the lazen hosts in Längenfeld: Akvapark Ötztal seems to look like ufo that just joined in Al’h.
From the three top of the winter covered pans, a couple stood as long as the mountains of Ötztal swallow to heaven.
Alhambra and Schwarzwaldu
Not in every floor, Mrs. Meder's basin collector was stuck in the chloor.
Many thermal lasses are feeling as if they are in the Ar’d lass in the Hungarian Béksessabi, that is too heavy oil that humans will just believe that he has reached the medical larves.
The insects originate from the medical water with the contents of alkaline hydrogenetic potentials, which is almost black and its seat swimming on the skin, as soon as a person enters the basin - sometimes a special effect of wellness.
However, at one place Iris Meder was searching for beautiful laser disappointments: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate flash Luhaczo, she reached a closed territory.
In 1902, Duschan Jurkovic was closed with the text of Duschan Jurkovic.
When Mrs. Meder looked down with the red-white-sheet windows, she saw the potentially growing floor between the walls.
In contrast with this, they set up in a shipwheel in Schwarzwald: Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These lessons have three phases of exhibition; a person can not only discover new Roman elements that are sealed from his appearance in 1844, but also the Mauritius court in Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation of 1995, Palais Thermal is a favorite lazenian place of Iris Meder, not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's a great performance, connecting so many building stocks to such a beautiful complex," Mrs. Meder says.
In such a palace, there is apparently a surrounding matter in the thermal base.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank is allowed to check the trading of commodities
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave his trade with agricultural sugars?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Joseph Ackermann trusted the group to investigate the results of speculation for the poor world.
Then in January, the director wants to take the investigations out of this.
Hamburg -
For social citizens, it is a matter: 84% of Germans are based on one study as unacceptable to speculate the banks with agricultural cereals as wheat or sugar.
Two thirds of the questioned even require Deutsche Bank and the final credit institutions from this trade because the problems of the worst world are deteriorated.
This is the outcome of the Force survey from the Foodwatch Confirmation Organization.
It is based on the report that Foodwatch presented in the midst of October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that the taxes in global commodity bubbles extinguish prices to the height and that the banks have a community with the world's hunger problem.
The campaign of consumers' protectors is designed specifically against Chef Deutsche Bank Joseph Ackermann, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
In fact, commodity forces were thoughts to ensure that trademakers were insured against price exhausts.
However, the majority of experts agree that the high-risk trade-related market operators have dismissed the offers and requests - and have gained profits to the lowest.
Otherwise than competitors in the United States reacted to Ackermann's criticism: He promised that the results would be checked and said that no trade "is not for the good news of the Deutsche Bank to be given in the ship".
According to the information SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international work is controlled by the Foodwatch-Report group.
By the end of the year, the control should be closed, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank representation, together with the recommendation to be submitted.
At the end of January, the representatives of the bank want to communicate the results.
Finally, the reduction of trade with commodities or even the total refusal could be made.
Ackermann works with his help on his image.
The Chief of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened its criticism of the financial sector: "The seat at the growing price of food shows particularly drasticks how the banks today harm the general good."
Let Ackermann be the highest bank. Lobbyists have the obligation.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from his portfolio all items in which money is used for food prices," said Bode.
"If Mr. Ackermann is concerned about the hunger of suffering people or about the story of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view appears to the first view as a surprising view, but it is that the Concern Boss for a few months before his department from the office would leave a perfect image.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the leader of the representation would not go to the supervisory Council other than planned.
Returning from a sportive agriculture speculation could improve its image.
And maybe he's not needed to take care of the loss -- and he's supposed to advise the end of his representative.
Everyone else would make investment in the floor.
Foodwatch is trying to keep a high pressure on the manager.
There are now more than 30,000 internet participants in the organization's campaign.
On Wednesday, the Bode published an investigation in which the Institute fors asked 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only eleven per cent is based on it as legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments with which feed prices are related.
Many bank clients would also conduct personal investigations if they knew that their banks were involved in such trades: each other would, as a result of the investigation, report all the investments in which money is running into the speculation with sugars.
43 per cent would warn known to such a bank, 49 per cent indicated that they would think of their statement and go to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Víden
Moving pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
History with tops, falls and happy ends: The Russian pavilion from the World Exhibitions in Brussels 1958 gained prices, became a Museum in Vienna, remained empty and released.
Now it's opened again as an exhibition house.
When it burns for modern refugee, for forms, glassed hauls, courageous dimensions and new building materials typically for faith in technical progress, then the Russian pavilion Karla Schwanzer is an excellent and glorious example for the Brussels World Exhibition of 1958.
The Swanzer's pavilion then received Grand Prix d'Architecture for his easily and highly-effective steel and glass.
The condition is still set as a milk of the current activity.
He praised the teacher so that he also built the Pavilion of Russia for the next world exhibitions.
With his Legendary Four War Palace BMW plus as a key made by the next building in Mnich, he was finally glorified internationally in 1973.
His as a temporary exhibition building, designed pavilion after the world's exhibition, placed in Switzer Garten at the South Bahnhof (South) and reconstructed and opened Museum in 1962 - was called "The House of the 20th century".
But it was not suitable for the Museum of the building, neither space nor technology - the walls missed for closing artificial exposures, no exciting climate.
However, it was used until the current art was reached in the New City of Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and was still more and more.
Now the Adolf Krischanitz pavilion has rebuilt, now carrying the name "The 21th century House" and will be used in the future as the Museum of current art.
On Wednesday evening there will open the Museum Belveder, whose palace belongs to, the first exhibition - a happy purpose in every aspect.
The new start of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became a new director of the Russian Gallery Belveder 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted historical art with a significant career, i.e. in the youth of a beauty, posti in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's Museum, and as a funding director of Musea modern Salzburg, promoted considerable reconstruction in politics and memories, cared of public and private sponsor money and determined use.
In addition to the current art, works of Fritze Wotruba society should be made with the same named hope, the coffee and booking, and the office building should be established.
Good supervision, low budget.
Then Krischanitz was an ideal occupation.
Not only that he was sensiblely reconstructing and enlarging Joseph Olbrich's session buildings in Vienna and winning competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Widena and pavilion was "inconsistently important place", on which he was "almost every week" watching the exhibition.
He knew the pop project and also knew the problems of the building which already lost its use in the movement to the Watch and the change of use in its greatness and easilyness.
In the current reconstruction, there were far more problems: the building was "the catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of glassed fasads have been changed, used by glassed flames of isolated glass and glassed steel replaced by special safety steel.
The cold pool-destination weapons were strengthened or changed, and the asbest filled arrows were sanished.
Two underground grounds offered a place for new use, leaved lighting channel between the building and the streets, to the input of the woods - almost new building, but still the splendid Swanzer pavilion.
The P's entrance doors have been kept, the building is built in an old anti-coroz red tone.
And the kinosal is even exactly the same as he was before.
And it's all for the low memory of the Office and the low budget.
"Frequently it must have been found a material that is good and nice and also enjoyed the memory office," says Krischanitz and points out the diluted ground of suteren.
Despite all pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airable.
It was difficult to have a pavilion, "who came here from Brussels," said Crischanitz recently, the typical "Drop-in-the-City-History".
Such a characteristics seem to be "always in the wrong place" and yet wants to "be relevant with self-consciousness".
In this case, however, the House of the 21th century is not in an inappropriate place, because urbanistic happiness has occurred: In the area around Schweizer Garten, the new "Capital Square at the Major Recompense" has appeared with office and resident houses.
And may still come to another happy event: House of the 21th century could receive support from another Crischanitz building, because Francesca von Habsburg's collector bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and how to hear them, one of the city of neighborhood in Schweizer Garten.
Drake plans a package for the winter crisis at millions of high
The drach was a crisis plan to protect the accidents of the wheel during the cold period.
The start of employees must be doubled.
That's gonna be a million.
In the fight against winter caused accidents of trains and lately, Deutsche Bahn issues in this year, according to the newspapers of more than 70 million euros.
The newspapers "image" reported a preliminary report to the internal concert plan that it was estimated to be a total of about 300 million euros by 2015.
It seems to be achieved by the better use of trains and rail networks too for extreme wind-skins.
It is also planned to double the number of intern and external employees for 16,000 people to remove snow on railway equipment and travellers.
The objective should be removed from the start of the operation and 90 per cent for the operation of needed evacuations within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the leader, Rüdiger Grube, warned after meetings at the highest level with the government representatives and the industry before the accidents of trains and late winters, too.
In the past cold period, it had significant problems in personal transport because there was no reservation in addition to difficult air pollution.
Thus, new regional trains are waiting for a year for the approval of the Joint Railway Authority.
Furthermore, the ICE flags are subsequent.
The road is also not aware that ICE-dracks must have to be more frequently controlled in the case of one ICE-draw on the main coverage of Köln to destruction of the repair.
Deutsche Bank pays a million of people in the United States
After breaking around the boss Joseph Ackermanna comes to the new trampots in the United States: Deutsche Bank must pay millions of damage there.
As a result of the problems at home, Deutsche Bank has not been enough, but its past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute is paying 145 million dollars in one balance management (106 million euros) to evaluate conflicts due to the bankruptity of five large associated banks during the financial crisis.
It's the sale of hypothetic sheets.
The NCUA financial market regulator calculates a whole range of large banks that the banks' associations have been broken by false promises to purchase financial products; that the risk is probably decreased.
Such papers have lost significantly the value of the crisis, and the banks have lost themselves.
"We are sure we could have solved the topic without the parties to the court," said speaker Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank does not recognize any guilt by compensation.
This also applies to Citigroup, which was committed to paying $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the integrity of both money institutions.
National Credit Union Propertyation (CUA) is responsible for the banks in the United States and assists bankroots to protect customers.
The NCUA is trying to obtain a refund for billion damage.
Now finished compensation is the first of its kind.
The regulator also rejected other large banks and demanded JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
In suspicious hypothetics, this is the so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
They're based on bank credits.
When the U.S. bubble broke around the illegality in 2007, it became a number of financial fires condemned.
In September 2008, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thinking on the top of the financial crisis.
Although a few years ago, the banks are now stuck in the wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have made claims to achieve corrections or doubts.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has made the largest claim.
The 18 international major banks suggested that two state-American financials involving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the trade with hypoteques in about 200 billion dollars.
Germane Bank must also complain FHFA, here are more trades in the total value of about 14,2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires that the French establishment comply with the "substantial losses " and that it does not impose a precise amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requests as inappropriate and announced that he wanted to defend it.
Warren Buffett enters 10 billion IBM
The Buffett Financial Gurmuh invests potentially in the IBM IT subdivision.
Since March he purchased a share of more than $10 billion.
Today, a significant American investor Warren Buffett has announced that it is possible to invest in IT and computers because fire development is only allowed to be predicted with difficulties.
However, he has now read the IBM business reports and has changed his view of investment.
He had already already had to understand that IBM offers services primarily and provides computer systems for IT-separation of other businesses.
Warren Buffetta's investment is found in the financial world to pass on a rider.
In this regard, the mother's horn IT IBM is now called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett has proclaimed to the American economic audience station of the NCBC that has purchased the IBM action from March at $10,7 billion.
His investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became so one of the largest IBM shareholders with a share of 5,5 per cent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about his engagement yet.
He praised the management, who tried to make economic crisis even for a good income.
"You made a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has already been working for a long time on lucracy IT services such as the operation of calculated centres.
More than 100-year computers is also offering software and advice and executive computers for companies.
Buffett's company's more disappeared than today.
It claims that it only invests in businesses whose activities they also understand.
Instead, Buffett sat after the cost railway, after the manufacturer of mass or after the manufacturer of machines.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway has also shared around 80 own daughter fires in a whole series of large concerts such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Münchener Back.
The 81-year-old Lord took a small textile company of Berkshire Hathaway in the past 60th century and built one of the most precious businesses in the world.
However, his way of life is modesty.
Therefore, for many investments there will be a culture around the world.
His almost immoral sense of making money brought him the "Orakel from Omaha (Orakel from Omaha).
When Buffet's investment became known, the IBM action was decreased before the start of a percentage.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, has a total price of over 220 billion dollars on the burst and is set together with Apple and Microsoft for the most valuable world businesses.
In the Microsoft company, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to go.
The founder Bill Gates thinks he's his trusted friend.
The threat is stumbleable
After the discovery of the "Bunks in Zwickau", the Turkish media doubt about the German legal state.
The news is even talking about "blood ideology", which is now reviving.
Eight small enterprises of Turkish pêch and one Greek in 2000 to 2006 had the right extremist background.
This report reacted to fear and anxiety in Turkey and within the German and Turkish population in Germany.
Because for many German Turks, there is a return of the fear that was considered dead: Since the attacks in M'n in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there was no comparable violation with the right extremist background.
That in Germany there is xenophobia, however, has never been doubted.
However, the right-handly extremistic network has discovered the range of which the dimension cannot be considered for a long time.
"There is a re-life ideology?" sounded the titles of the "Haberturk".
In contrast, the news of Sabah highlights that one of the hosts should be a secret police officer for the protection of the constitution and fear that the German authorities could also be involved in the right radical weight.
The Turkish province of Germany reacted reasonably: she remembered the weekend of the demonstration of silence before the Brandeburian gate of racial violence victims.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish state in Berlin, together with the German and Turkish Policy, reminded the fifty-year German-Turkey agreement on the collection.
In the joyful colors, a common life has been enhanced - as success.
As a set here, the reporting of several Turkish media: "German of Germany to the fifty" is the subscription of the article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
The edition of the "Hurriyet" letter for Germany can't take it so that it doesn't take this ideaal connection.
"It starts to get it," sounds the title of the column from Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people who paid taxes and their jobs have contributed important contributions to the restoration of Germany.
The most critical is discussed in German Internet forests the police procedure and its latest success in the breakfast.
Why did the German authorities have not seemed so much before that after suspicious guards in the right extreme cross, the authors are wonderful.
So many are leading to at least the retoric engine to use drastics: "If the activity continues to be so surrounded here, it will be no more than its own defence and weapons."
"It may be the best self-defense."
"On the quality of explaining and accuracy of the whole network depends very strongly from the internal peace in Germany ", writes "Selen".
What it means, if the internal peace is threatened in Germany, they explain atentities in Mın and Solingen in the nineteen years.
The photography of the burning in Solingen is deeply thrown into the memory of Germans and Turks.
Because no other event has shown to the Turks living here more that there is a mature threat and Germany that uncertainty and disappointment can be carried out in the right violence.
However, atents have affected the Turkish sides of more evident feelings of mutuality.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish pressure, it was primarily criticized the failure of German policies after attentions: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those who survived.
After an attack in Solingen, he sent a constraint telegram to the Turkish State president, but he was allowed to deal with his minister by Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel, then, in his statement, count the payments of Turkey.
That's as if the value of the human being measured according to the height of his tax.
The current reporting of Turkish media shows again the deepness of many German Turks in the current state-right arrangement.
According to the effort to enlarge the interpretation and a new evaluation of the right extreme terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
Scanning bank at Curish Lake
The best European bank has no seat in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered for the financial crisis of bankrots and from one crisis to another.
Now the German has to compare it.
That's what Axel Weber didn't think.
After his appeal from the leadership of the Federal Bank, in July, it was known that it would take 2013 to the same speeculate new employment: the President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in the career.
Axel Weber enjoyed publicly, praised Switzerland for his beauty and UBS for her newly obtained solidity and said friendly notes about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has been operated."
"I'm glad to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grubbel."
But in September, it was pretty important that everything would be fully different.
One UBS dealer, London, broke all the bank security systems and lost approximately 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Oswald Grübel, not only the Swiss recognized banker, had to leave.
The President of the UBS Management Council is also as based - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has become known that Weber'e can work since February 2012.
And we will take the Presidency of the Governing Board already in May - not just in 2013, as the bank reported on Wednesday.
It'll be strong for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, but a Professor of Economy and Banker, and he'd certainly need a time for work.
We will then take the responsibility for the bank's strategy, which just once again proved that it deserves the title "The Bank of the Greatest Scandals in Europe"
Because UBS is, however, great - until recently, it was the greatest property manager in the world - and it is still running for a year from one scandal to another.
Nothing, so it seems, the fierce Swiss bank will not remain safe.
It started for the financial crisis.
In 2007, UBS used an excellent story.
The image of the silent and solid, but also the ambitional objectives of the property manager is combined by the ambitional manager: she also wanted to mean something in the investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed more than $1,6 billion than any other world bank.
And on the other hand, she was a investment bank in the ligue of the largest world banks.
That's what it's doing.
An ex-banker and a recent-year-old banking professor in Curych Hans Geiger reports: "I've noticed UBS to my students as a pattern of a good bank."
"On today's view, a man asks, "How could I just make a mistake?"
He was a big mistake.
In 2007, something was clear in UBS was clear.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli was a surprising leader of the representation, which has yet been considered a highly intelligent and also a genial banker.
In a few months later, he realized why he left.
The bank's investment division lost subprime papers and had to describe billions.
In order to succeed, UBS announced an increase in the range of 13 billion francs.
Therefore, it was found investment, but it was so discreet that a man did not know his name.
But it was just the first time.
This was worse in April 2008.
Bank had to recognize a new billion losses, President of the Government Council of Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best payable Switzerland Government Board, left.
In October 2008, the disaster was followed: UBS became due to its error investment for financial crisis before healing and had to be saved by the State.
Nationalbank sold the UBS for ten billion billion valuable papers, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs to the obligation to change the obligation for which it could be a contracting bank.
The whole Switzerland was cut off - because he noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when he has so large banks in his territory.
Finally, the UBS sum of 2007 was more than five times more than the performance of the Switzerland economy (see image).
"They couldn't save UBS again," says Banko Geiger expert.
The second is the first catastrophe.
For a few months, UBS was in charge with America, and she was willing to issue data of eligible customers who, if my bank was helped, cut taxes.
Moreover, she agreed with the payment of $780 million - as the return of unleavened profits from these trades in the prospect of repentance.
The UBS learned more or less innerly that helped the reduction of taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that was rejected by her competition for rich clients: a secretary of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss Bank has not already been secret what was before.
The Chairman of the Presidency and the Chairman of the Management Board were followed.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus, the bank lost its advantage in both central trades over a few months: in the investment banking for bad speculations and in the management of the property for aid to shortage tax.
And just when it was a little quiet again, just when the UBS thought that it was renewed, this unfortunate business anabasis comes here: the only dealer lost 1,7 billion euros before the bank noticed that it was something wrong.
And it's fair: with the management of the risks in the investment banking company, it's obviously still not wrong.
"In the case of Adoboli, it is likely that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, the economics and the Financial Professor of Financiality at the Bank's Institute of the University Zürich.
The Financial Director of the Great German Bank is also saying, "The UBS problem is that he does not control risks."
Instead, it was exactly the idea of caution that Switzerland bankiers had done before a time to become the guardians of the world's great possessions: no too big risk, therefore the security for money - also the Alp Republic has rebuilt the world from this side.
The Swiss bank tresors became a symbol for inconsistent cohesion such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly quality chocolate.
The UBS center in Curychu is still running to the closer good Swiss private banks - is just a little more.
The position is classic.
The Bank has its main seat in the Kurish Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curish Lake, which is covered by the snowed tops of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are wonderful, the acquisition of trades belongs to the highest in Europe.
Clenotics like Tiffany's are here between Swiss traditional trades like Sprüngli sugars.
The Swiss bank is here since a century: from the National Bank through Palast der Credit Suisse to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
UBS is entered into the receipt chale by the hard round doors.
Inside the walls are covered by a marmor, and there are potential skin chairs in front of them, near the bank's log, a large direction to "seif".
UBS knows what the client is looking for: security.
This is the idea of the Swiss Bank's two major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, however, sometimes - have hit or delivered the leader of a small Swiss private bank.
His name would never want to read in newspapers, finally concluded, as all Switzerland bankers, too with both large banks of trade.
UBS may have been too increased, it is, especially in the investment banking company, where the increases have been expanded.
The Swissians may not have anything to say about it.
"And if it were, they have been adapted to English ways ago."
In fact, this was the English Investment Bank, which UBS changed, leaded to the first high profit and then to the burying: No European financial institution lost so much money as the Swuzzer Granbank in the jungle around Subprime.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was evident.
"In that middle, the government coals of seven million countries have been raised to the greatest salvation action in its people," writes the author Lukas Hássig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion franks or approximately 45 billion euros have been approved by politicians to save the staff bankroom.
How could that be done?
If they're talking to Swiss bankers, they'll see your problem primarily in UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three Switzerland major banks joined the powerful concert.
The bank, which already was too big for the small Switzerland at the time of the fusy, continued to grow.
In addition, the two distant banks were added to the UBS preliminary: one rich but inflammated bank in Curycha with difficulties in the management of property and poorer, but more internationally involved.
Immediately, internationalized investment bankiers came advantagely to many money with which they could solve a large rule.
The UBS has two names: Peter Wuffli, leader of UBS and Marcel Ospel, then President of the Governing Board from 2001 to 2007.
"I've always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the future team," says Banko's Professor Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modesty, who knows many of the models and statistics and Ospel, a man manages feelings around the crap that has worked from the bank completely up."
But, uh, I mean, the Ospel got on Wuffli at the end.
And at the end, Wuffli probably made a decisionful mistake: "I thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, the spirit has fallen.
UBS employees are focusing on the main workshops on which the Concern Boss Wuffli continued to repeat the same password: Snap Goldman Sachs from the throne below.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank of the world.
She said "League Tables", a Officer who documents the success of the bank at that time.
The UBS attempted to locate it completely up.
A few steps have happened.
The games were completely upstairs in the trade with devises and actions.
However, business advisers who have been granted highlight one weakness: in the international ratio trade, "Fixed Income" bankers, it is likely that there is a great decline behind the largest banks.
UBS has approximately spaces in American hypothetic products.
In order to close this area, UBS decided to be well-being, which was almost existence.
Hunger after growth, both the bank's own and its funds are funded to ensure risks in the US subprime investment.
It was developed in a powerful machine that packed valuable papers on the American hypothetical credits and delivered it further - while it also left the risk.
Moreover, when the final banks were looking for a long time.
"Too in 2007, when the market with inviolence was in flames, UBS bought there," says bankoGeiger.
How big it's, how deep it's.
One manager after the other had to take away when trying to quiet was more difficult than he thought.
The positions in the UBS became a catapulating seat, and they're going to go up until today.
Whoever leads the big bank now has an incapable job.
It must find a bank strategy that all nearby trade models have disappeared.

Intelligent wheels are spread in cities
In many places, havres of fields have been placed for "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals can't be released from the city for a long time, strong experts.
Some of them are owned, they would be quite released: the doors belong to the image of the city since a century, yet in some communities the people's complaint to the uncleanness and sound of animals caused.
On the contrary, it is not against "problem birds" yet in the supervision.
The Havrana fields may not be able to leave the city anymore, but experts on the first symposium of returns in Eastern African Leer.
There were experts from the whole social territory on possible easts.
They are looking for alternatives in towns
At the same time, natural protectioners have brought the problems of the cities from the exode of particularly protected hazards of the field: the use of chemicals in agriculture is likely to destroy traditional life.
Following, growing campaigns and shaking of typical trees to destroy birds disorders life.
The doors are protected.
Great colonies with more than 600 neighbors are outside the Westfalse Soest, northwest, other than Jever, Diepholz and Achima at Brem and Leer.

Removing the noise by slipping water or smoking of trees has often adverse results, also said a expert on the lives of Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Badensk-Württembersk.
"The animals come up, the big colonies grow and divide into other places."

Ms. Jürgens joined the Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg Scientific Travel, which provides the information table of learning about the life of a highly intelligent havre of the field.
The project is likely to accept tourists.
Also, on the criticism of the sound of the bird caused by Mrs Jürgens, she had her own opinion: "This is about every volume of communication, she has much to say."
Intelligence and distress of animals are legendary: Havrani fields use not only a help to achieve memory, but even as a helper of their tool will be prepared.
Researchers from the University in Cambria recently tested the behaviour of four havrane fields as far as birds have reached the intellectual.
In one experiment, the birds learned that they must bring stones up to the larve of mole.
Without a large trend, they have known what size and face must have stones to cause the colaps of the floor.
In the second trial, the broken backs had to solve a lighter problem.
In the left of the war, the researchers placed a small rubber with a larve mole.
The birds couldn't achieve their benefit.

Personal mask
Essentially strong new book Peter Englunda named Beauty and Success: Trust History of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with a long list of positions that appear until you get the head.
One advice to keep on this moment: Take care of this page and make a bookmark from it.
You will be very well familiar with all people in the Roman account of Mr. Englund, and this list will serve you as a navigation - as a poor - in the moments when you will feel like men and women in the story and feel deceived and loss in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and a journalist.
It is also a new place in the Swedish Academy, which gives Nobel's price for .
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, pretty ≥ "antihisto" work.
It contains a number of very known names, important contracts or celebrations, but it lacks a lack of wallets, energy journalists and taktic discussions and equipment.
It isn't even a book of what happened, explains the author, rather than "the book about what it was." It is mainly "faiths, thoughts, experiences and invasions".
"Beauty and grief" combines in it the war-up 20 more less tuctic men and women, on both sides of baricade, from students and botanics to hour, doctors, salvation drivers and officers.
Some of these people become herds.
Others become military prisoners, come about the conceit, foolish, or dead.
Their lives are mixed as flames of lights in the church - newly added to the web of judgments while others are arrested.
Mr. Englund's book is different from classic historical Romans.
He adjusts the idea that the First World War was only about horrible battles at the West front.
"Beauty and triumph" also examines the other places where war dramatics were running: Alpy, Balkan, East front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book resolve problems by falling on them the nid, having Christmas in the shadow of the pyramid, or having the presence of much tse-tse.
It's from the beginning that it's about a very gracious reading.
War will ruin people's lives as a natural disaster, such as Katrina's urican in the shooting work.
When the remote is going to call a shot from the board, and you are a woman who is home with your children, you're going to escape or stay?
Who's actually coming near?
But no one understands what's going on, even why the whole war was dissolved.
"The vacuum resulted from the lack of facts," Mr. Englund observed, "the agreements, opinions, fears, prejudices, conspiratory theories, dreams, night mormons and fames were filled."
"Beauty and grief" follows the stories of individuals, such as Florence Farmborough, an English health sister in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young mariner serving in German football.
Their stories are collected in the universal part of magazines, letters and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives can sound harmful and disappointed, but the short time and detail are completely alive and reliable.
Many of them are negotiating and comparing with him.
In the story of German students, the author says, "Pleasures, all the same refunds."
"The coffee's payment, the kidnapper's imitation, the imitation of the gume, the paper boxes, the wood buttons."
He's still going on and describes the replacements of food in Germany.
It is mentioned as "mass made of lised rise coated in the cup (and added to false bone of wood), tobacco of dry roots and dry wooden pools, bottles with trees".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat replacements in the production of parks and 511 registered coffee replacements".
Some stories are about honour and mildness.
One American is located inside the wildness and brutality, as it states about the war: "You finally understand that this is a human nature. Although sitting in a pleasant cross with cigarette and whisky, dinner news or good book, this mask represents civilization and that there is no barbar behind me in the nitro."
Instead, the British soldier realizes that with the biggest probability he will die soon and that no one will not notice it, so that he will triumph.
"When a man finally comes to peace with the sacrifice, he would at least expect that this happens before the air of the thankful public," he writes.
But instead, it seems to be a "court who is secretly covering".
Other comments relate to the department of ancient Europe and the arrival of new fears.
"Conflict with the more economic competition and competitive fight," says Mr. Englund, "the war between the factors."
He captured what he says "a new kind of beast of the coming centuries: an explicit and ideologically swearing mass killer in the clothes shotted on the peace that his blood flows, without rising from the table."
People are totally unexpected, the ground is coherent with herd.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who have promptly tried to catch a sexal disease from the prostitute so that they could avoid the service on the front.
"The most gross example of this behaviour was trade with a gonokoke kid that soldiers purchased and cut off with genitality in the sight that ends in the hospital," he writes.
"The most confidential were in his eyes, which often blinded until the end of life."
In this translation from Swedish from Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s proselyte is fascinated, but it does not show what is very important to his human theme.
In decades of small outcomes, it catchs the way war "expertly inexcusable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are forced to fight.
The best books on the First World War rather than with a complex statement worked with signs, for example "World War and Modern Encyclopedia" from Paul Fussella or Romans as "To Western Front Calm" from Erich Marii Remarque.
Mr. Englund gives an advantage to the unconventional sense.
His book has the most incredible arrangements that have no periods in the literature.
But I'm not going to hurt him to you.
Yet, you will feel like the author suddenly shot out of the book, threw out a page from the list of herds from the hand and burned it.
After the previous error this time per minute the exactly planned time
Hundreds of police officers, some of them in the ships used for street accidents.
On Monday night, she was chosen on Tuesday because the Zuccotti park should be empty at that time.
No one knew about the action except a few highly established experts; the other was first said that it was practice.
In the head of the action, the police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted how many problems the police division had to take place during the operation.
They should not repeat cases from the last weeks when, for example, the use of petroleum admissions against demonstrants, which violated the rules of separation, and also the public sympathy was overcome on the side of squatters.
Therefore, the police operation aimed at cleaning the Zuccotti park from demonstrants, started up to two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leading representatives were allowed to be inspired by operations running in the rest of the cities.
The mass of exercise for the case of behaviour in crisis was running in Randalls Island, which was prepared for action in Zuccotti Park.
The leading factors strengthened the so-called training to deal with disturbance - anti-terrorist measures that include the movement of a large quantity of cops - by focusing on the city part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training passed on Monday night, to the Manhattan side of the river East River.
The orders to move to the park came to the word "in the last minute" declared someone to whom the action was just explained as "learning".
"I know a few of the police who were also invited to this action, and no one said to them that he was going to the Zuccotti park," said the person who spoke just under submination that he would remain anonymous.
"It's just the highest position of the members of the Department."
One of the deepest lections was a lesson that the city had received once.
On October 14, the representatives of the city were supposed to clean the park, but then they departed from the plan, because as the demonstrators heard of it, they were included before the operation was started in the park of a hundred.
Internal action has been made by the police from different units, including foreign groups around - tens of police who are currently used to strengthen the fourth with a higher level of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, it comes to the park and a lot of people go back, so one hour night was the ideal time to start the action.
"It was appropriate to perform it at the time when at least people will be in the park," he said.
Before the units went out, they were arranged at the border of the Pike Slip Street and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bri. The costs of car rental units with cloud lamps and amplions.
The lights and the recording reports of the amplions have been scared of many demonstrators.
When the members of a series of units entered the park in their blue trees, many demonstrators packed their things and went away.
The police claims that until 1:45 she has not reached the only apartment that she wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack things.
Other teams of police were seen in the park border so that they could enter into the park if there was a need for an appeal.
The reporters were required to leave the park.
Clause of the Police Department Paul J. Browne claimed that it was for their security.
Many journalists, however, believe that the police wanted to defend them in seeing her units in the action, and also some police officers had been taking their back.
Mr. Browne claimed that television vehicles at Church Street leadership could be able to drive out the west border of the park without problems.
Police was walking in the west direction and broke up with a huge mistake of personal things that protested, including bonds and igelites of full clothes, and followed them by teams from the hygiene division, which straightened all that was left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were removed from the park. Documenting image materials appeared sometimes later on the Internet.
The most intelligent group of demonstrators came near the kitchen in their camp, which lied near the middle of the park.
Some have created a defense, and the police have started their methodological attack.
Nearly ten people in the camp center were joined each other.
And two people joined the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the Preparation Services were approved to cross the locks.
Until 3:30 in the park there was no attack, Mr. Kelly reported.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, and the police sounded exhausted.
Mr. Browne said that there were about 142 people in the park.
The majority of the arrests went from the "Organization of Disturbance and Opposition," he explained.
The highest police officer at the place of action was Joseph J. Es­o, the police officer, the highest uniformized officer for the division.
The operation was personally held by Phil T. Pulaski, the director of the Department Detectives.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he didn't share in the operation," Mr. Browne said.
The second group of police were waiting for Broadway's east side, between Liberty Street Street and Cedar Street, for the case it would be necessary to call her.
On the Cortlandt Street Street, the block north of the park, and on the Pine Street Street, the block southern from the park, were thrown down the ships.
From these places, the police developed a protective trail from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, the police were watched, from which many shields were equipped, as people were struggling forward to this border.
There were approximately 28 people at the north border.
The bigest actions of the night passed south from the park.
About the fifth hour a demonstrator was seen south from Pine Street, sprung on the police car cap, and a few others who left the air from the pneu of the police delivery.
In a minute, he's running a kiss of slips out of Dave.
At the end of the operation, one policeman and one protester was hospitalized.
The committee will complain about the city for release
The representatives of hundreds of school assistance workers who have come for work last month plan to demand the city in the middle. They claim that the release was not necessary and that the discrimination was also due to an inappropriate impact on schools visiting poor students.
The Court of Justice is probably the latest options remaining to the committees in the District Council 37 in their efforts to repeat the decision on the release.
In October seventh, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid employees of the city. Their releases of the members of the committee described as a payment of the city because they were not able to access the health care fund for the management of work by reading which the city wanted to flee the ticket in the budget.
The representatives of the city rejected this categoric accusation.
The Minister of School Dennis M. Walcott said that the release was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately checked that no one in the budget had spoken specifically of the release of assisting works.
The representatives of the District Council 37 announced that they already fulfilled the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of School that they would complain about it.
Mr Walcott and the Ministry of School will be complained in the process, while the complainant will be the eight lost works, of whom all are afro-american or his's, as well as the rest of those who have come to work.
Elizabeth Thomas, the speaker of the town's legal department, said that the city hadn't seen a complaint yet, and thus expressed himself to individual accusations.
According to the complaint that has been able to get New York Times, the committees focused on the quantities released in poor parts of the city, which wanted to support their claims of unfair acts. It is also the opinion that poor schools have come for more assistance because they have already been rejected enough financial employment.
They indicate that while at schools in the Staten Island part, there was no release in the part of Upper East Side, at least in Brooklyn, part 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants, and in parts 8 and 9 in South Bronx, even 46 assistants were released.
At the point that at the University of Public School 36 in Harle, five of the eight assistants have lost work, although it is about school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. In the complaint, "It is not about the neighborhood of speaking parents who are able to gain financial costs in the budget."
The start of the Public School 36 has been reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and the school has also come about money when the city has changed the way to calculate bonus finances for each poor student.
Boards, other than otherwise, claim that the directors of the high schools could be deteriorated by the way that the document was written for authorising the release of parental coordinators.
The document used for the description of the action the word "excess", thus rejecting the position, although this word is more frequently used to describe the movement of the artists from the school paper to the database of available jobs which the recompense of the Central Authority is charged.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators have been released," they are stated in the complaint, "not only moved to the database at the location of available jobs."
Miss is at the end, Congress is ready to adopt a Libya's agreement
Finally, the Republicans and the Democrats at the conference will agree with something about the resurrection in Libya.
However, before that occurred, the revolution had to succeed, the Governing Dictator Muammar Kaddafi had to be captured and killed and the units of the United States had been completed.
On Wednesday, the Commission for the International Senate Relations will decide on the exhibition supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McC±m (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which Libyans should be welcomed to their successful resurrection and the American units to thank for the "satisfaction".
"In this statement, we want to evaluate the courage of the people of Libya who started with the conversion of their country," said Kerry.
"Buts of the political speech would like to express support by their democratic efforts."
This may seem innocent, but no debate about Libya has been easily.
During the year, the legislators of both sides continued to consider between themselves and the White House the version of the series of declarations to approve or refuse of the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain resolutions authorised the use of American armed forces in Libya.
We have been rejected in Snembray because of the distant opinions of both political parties, so it has never been voted in the Senate.
However, at the same time that the House was rejected in the Sneavia, the chair also refused measures that would stop the financing of American operations in Libya.
This is what the American mission in Libya has experienced in the legislative cleaning - Congress criticized the way president of Obama's mission is conducting, but its members obviously did not harm him to stop supporting him at his beginning.
The importance of the congress finally preceded further events.
The Rebels received Tripolis in August, and on October 20, Caddafi was killed.
Miss Nato officially ended on October 31.
Now Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations in its statement "congratulates the people of Libya for their indirect courage and wonderful disturbance they have been able to free their people" and "that praises men and women of armed forces of the United States and their associations who have participated in the operation for the protection of the Libyan population for extravagant wealth and professionality."
The statement also "affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and unreversibly transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the Commission receive a full support for international relations, or will the legislators re-distribute in two halfs, as it was in the approval of the June Wood?
Contrary to the last version, Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the main representative of the Republican Party in the Commission.
Lugar's speaker on Monday said he hadn't seen the final version of the new story yet.
This week will be voted on the Statute, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority to all the Republics and Democrats in Congress.
This measures adopted by Bob Goodlat (Va.) will be the first part of the Statute on the budget or other theme to vote in the whole of the Sneam or Senate.
Other legislators have not yet been able to interfere with their expectations until their own vote.
Goodlat's nage is only one of the 68% of the stations represented at the conference and touched the wide scales of different subjects.
Some of them were the same - the same advice presented Snamovly and Senate - and others are only small exchanges of others.
Only in the Sneamable can be found at least 15 versions of the balanced budget and the other hole that would "regulate the federal expenditure".
Some of us are the same, but their staff - especially the invasive publicans who want to improve the story - can be praised by their "needs".
The conclusion on the regulation of the budget approved in August requested that Snémovna and Senat vote on the balanced budget.
In March, 58 Senators voted in favour of an illegal declaration to support the result of this.
In addition to the budget, several members want to negotiate and limit the number of periods in which the members of the convention could serve while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the amount of the period to be held in the president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a whole series of persons that would guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
It remains an addition to prohibiting the marriage of couples of the same sex and the addition prohibiting the fire of the State flag.
Some legislators also want to enable the cancellation of federal laws in the case of two third countries against them.
Although the members of the Congress are very active in the monitoring of different areas, in comparison with the previous years, they are not extremely distracted from the prospectus.
In the 11th Congress, they offered 77, while they were 66 in the 100th Congress.
Their activity is even flat compared to the beginning of the 1970s when members offered more than 150 per year, according to the Senate Books.
However, they were not much more successful than the current policy.
The latest addition added - 27th appendix - was added in 1992, but the Congress was proposed in 1789.
"Free, but not hurt," Gifford says in her first television talk from shooting
Ten months after the shooter in a public meeting with the election in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on Monday evening on the whole national television, sing together with a melodia from the broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and announced that more than to return to the Congress was demanded to heal.
Giffords appeared in the order "20/20" at the ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that her creation still makes problems and needs help when she walks.
The whole order documented its gain to the reckonvalences, which were necessary for the damage of the caused cow, which broke the left half of the brain, and behind it out of the head.
Three months ago, she was surprisingly returned to Snown to participate triumphally on the vote on the debt.
In her first television interview from the January shooting, during which six persons were killed and 13 others were hurt, Giffords laughed, laughed and sang -- while she described her retraction as "difficulty".
When Sawyer asked how she felt, Gifford's 11-year-old answered, "Very well."
The conversation with Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly's astronaut, was part of the hour specialist work "20/20", which was sent before the edition of a new book of this couple, named "Gabby: Reality of courage and on".
The specialist followed the entire Gifford re-valence from the shooting of January 8th.
On the videos that Kelly touched during the first week, it's to see Giffords in the hospital bed with a thrown head and a rubber throughout the head.
While her husband encourages her, she can't be more than one or two fingers.
About a few months later, Gifford's is arrested, sitting in the road chair and terapeutics teach her how to perform easy activities.
Heavy covering.
Education of lips.
And then, her first word, "Co."
During a few days, Giffords expressed another word - "toast", when she requested changes in her dinner.
Videos from the ABC stations show that the playing role for Giffords music playing: Congressmanka sing on them together with therapy on melodie to the song "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" from Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" from Tom Petty.
During Gifford's conversation, which spent two hours daily therapy, Sawyer's reported that she didn't remember anything from the day when the shooting happened.
Her husband said Gifford had predicted the newspapers on the shot until 12 March when she first asked him who was the sixth who was killed in the accident.
From the shooting is a suspicious Jared Lee Loughner, who is held in Missoury's office, where he is waiting for a judicial process under the influence of the drugs violently given.
"A lot of people die," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Free, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer told his wife at a moment during the rekonvalescence, "I've lost."
"So I said to her right now, Gabby, you didn't lose it," Kelly described.
"You just got a laptop.
But you'll be able to do it, you'll get back and get back even stronger than ever before."
Military units are more competitive than with respect
This event was a galaxer at Wall Street, who took millions of dollars for war veteranas in New York, who have no shot over the head.
Kid Rock sing a ballaad of impatience, frustration and loss.
Some hundreds of soldiers, mariners, aircrafts and mariners were running away.
The honestly dressed damage rose up and was softly cut off.
"The men and women who served in the army were considered herds," said David Saltzman, who arranged a warm benefit.
On the morning, the president of the Committee of the Chairs of the Chairmans of the Chairmans of the Chairmans also participated in the celebration of the evening and was also advocate Mike Mullen, who, however, saw the role of the military units sometimes differently.
"All were represented as poor poverty," wrote the expert in the e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought that well.
I know.
But what I saw was not a respect, it was a sorry.
Thus, the completely opposite ideas only illustrate a small relationship between the army and the often distorted, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The soldier is included freely with praise for his victims.
But this praise is something worth, they're saying soldiers.
The public is still more behaving as if the only one in the uniform was deceived.
"We're no victims at all," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the units in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems to be the only way some can support us is to put us into the role of injurious souls."
This subject is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or to show relationships with the public they serve.
They also realize that the wrath to which the units had to come back from Vietnam was much worse.
The result is that the majority of the words of compassion is carried out in silence and in private between military veteranes.
When two sons of Colonel Marc Cancen returned from the fighting activities where they served as the marine pigs, their father warned them that people would look out of two angles for their service.
In view of some, they will feel respect and ugh because they have struck the enemy rebellion and visited exotic places.
But to other people, he will turn his head, if "under the surface he doesn't cover a bad, violent veteran," Cancian said, "which made wars in Iraq and after returning to Washington in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for work, some people who were talking with him unfortunately indicated whether soon after returning to the battle, they would be able to deal with the stress connected to work in Washington.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count with negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
Army's anxiety partly from America's hostility to wars.
Success in the habitation field is only a little bit of recognition in the country, which has only a small hostage and in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is only a little of its own advantage.
"As a nation we no longer appreciate military heroism as it was running for the Second World War," said General Commissioner David Barno, who commanded American units in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by the political and public is focused mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
The soldiers are referred to as a number of actions they have suffered, a number of friends that they have lost, or a range of their damage.
The army faces the growing pressure to strengthen violation
This week will be decided whether 28 women and men against the army will be initiated due to evidence of inactivity in the case of violence.
No, the claim is prepared to submit hundreds of other persons.
The first Elizabeth Lyman's military class was the night when she was particularly violated to her colleague from the army, 25 years and was in pregnancy at the 11th week.
It happened in October 2008, and she moved to the casier to the airline base Miramar northward from San Diega. After dinner with a friend, she reached her husband's unfruited box with 12 beer.
He asked her if she could join her that they could drink a little at her room.
"My head lighted a warning light," described Lyman.
But the parent Texasan ignored her meetings completely.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," she said.
"I would listen to my instincts."
He says just a few minutes after they entered her room, the man went to her, threw her into bed and violated her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other centuries or former military members will wait for a verdict of hearing that might have a historical impact. This will be played in Arlington in Virginia, and it will take place on whether the accusation against the former Minister of Defence of Robert Gates and his former leader, Donald Rumsfeld, will be made before the court.
The accusation states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the fight against the spread of violence in the army, which is in contrast with the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The accusation was given in February to the washington lawyer Susan Burke and the complainant party had 17 members at that time. However, during the following months, their number increased to 28 - 25 women and three men who all claimed that they were violently attacked by their colleagues in the army and that the army failed to investigate, accusation and any harm for justice.
Burke claims that he's going through his neck to the highest hosts of the army, because the problem's just starting with them.
"Armé is a directive system," he says.
"Who are people who are in the position that they can avoid the efforts to take measures against such actions?
Burke also states that she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of them could be part of the other claims given in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than collecting all accusations in this case - she put all sheep into one box, as she says herself - she gives complaints in several different cases, if the pressure is necessary.
The Defence Defence Department of the State Representative of the United States, Neil MacBride, who, together with its cooperation, encouraged the rejecting of the case.
The newsweek court documents detailedly deal with the statement strategy - in principle, the current or former soldiers cannot complain to the army for the hurt they suffered as members of armed forces.
In accordance with the Regulation of the Supreme Court of 1950 called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage that soldiers suffer in the active service.
"Sufficient damage relates to military services of complainants," it is written in the document.
The Defense Minister refused to express this matter.
However, most have changed since the fifty years.
Although women have not yet to serve officially in the fight, it is only a vocabulary: in modern wars it is only difficult to find a given front line.
In wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's military teams played a more significant role, especially in communicating with civil women providing in the war zone.
The result: among these wars, 150 women's soldiers fell -- two thirds of them directly in battle.
It's time to come to modernization in the army, explains Burke.
He's not alone in his battle, besides the case, he'll kill three other legal representatives.
At Yale's legal school, visitors of the veterinary seminar on legal services of complaints on four main military academy for a huge development of the atmosphere that promotes hate to women.
About this, the United States Vietnamese Veterans' non-requiremental organization has a base for its complaint against the Army. This claim is focused on the diagnosis of the "personal pollution" which has been determined in the victim of violence to have an army to release them - according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati, a group of human rights for the Service Women's Action Network, is about a complete practice.
Its group has already made a claim against the State organisation for the negotiation with veterinary persons charged by discrimination practices to which the processing of a request for assistance from the parties who claimed that they were sexually attacked in the service.
In the Congress, nine individual opinions were presented, which the group of Senators and Missions from both political parties had submitted, and had a series of correct measures in them.
According to the Office for Prevention and Solution of Sexual Violence of the Ministerial Defense, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains notified in the majority of cases and, according to Pentagon’s own estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated number of 19.000 incidents that occurred in that year.
In the report issued in March, there is also a deterioration of the penalty of suspects: In 2010, 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army, which is half of the distortion of the civil justice system.
The complainants in the case of Burke's representative describe the attacks only as the first of the whole series of traumatisms.
For example, Lyman's first class warriors reported that the military police had been violated not for a hour after he had to come to him.
During the night, she said, she was asked to repeat the details of her violence to 11 different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She understood all the investigations necessary to determine violence, and in her bed the blood of an attacker was found - from the blood that she made for him.
In six months later, in April 2009, Lyman had decided the audience before the court, during which questioned whether she loved her friend on the day of an attack.
Six persons were invoked that as witnesses of the story were spoken in the benefit of the reporter, who finally had been forgotten by the guilty.
"I'll take myself on the day the sentence was made," says Lyman.
"I had to feel that I was born right there -- with a cry I went out of the court court."
"They put me on a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I said to my Master, "It wasn't his judgment.
The Lymans ordered to visit a military psychiatric, who finally affected her personality injury, which signed her as an ineffective in the service.
In January 2010, the military was released without honour and, therefore, without demand for the debt.
Whether the case of Lyman and the rest of the complainants is moved to another phase or not, it's a run on a trace, says John Turley, professor of the right to the Rights University of George Washington.
Of course, he notes, "From my angle of view, they should be able to go into another stage of negotiation."
However, between them and the verdict, the doctors mentioned have been criticized since the first moment that the world’s light has seen.
I'm the entire life critical of the doctor of Feres Doctrine.
The army is a few decades behind, because their obligations are not able to keep the same measure of motivating firms and fearing forces.
He adds, "The chances are hard against them... but it's important for them to try it."
It will only happen when good people will be willing to fight.
In their benefits, Burkevoa, the lawyer of complaints, shall keep hundreds of other persons prepared to submit a complaint and continue to work on other cases relating to this subject.
"We will not stop fighting the army in this matter, from where it doesn't come to reform," he says.
Or until we die, according to what's going on before.
Walls have eyes: How do you look at Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of the right extremism in Europe, he was only another young man who presented his anti-motive opinions on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who was admitted to the murderer of July, after which 77 died in Norway, participated in his first public audience.
Although Breivik was able to act alone, it was not absolutely solemn in the cyber space: during the preparation of an attack, he was chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who supported the rights group on social networks.
After the tragedy of the year, people want to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - it's enough to go to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not really so difficult to get them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of the recent reports of the British Research Team related to European Digital Populism.
The principle of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett, that it was enough for the doctors to easily use the advertising on the pages, and thus determine the demography group searched - something that marketing workers have been doing for a whole year.
Bartlett's team throughout Europe has found half a million of the right group fans who have focused on them and sent their intentions, but instead of calling them to the newly developed group or offering them adequate diet products, they have invited them to fulfil the questionnaire in which questions about their education, the relationship with nausea and optimism were addressed as regards their own future.
In the middle of Facebook with Bartlett and his colleagues, the results of more than 100,000 fans of 14 different rights groups in 11 European countries - unless they have to leave the office at all.
"It's a completely new way to conduct research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online levels of right groups are young men who consider the growing level of mobility.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, democracy and less violent than those who remain still hiding behind the screen computer."
The DEMOS team work is only one of the examples of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of people.
Research teams, health teams and political researchers use these pages to study all, from health problems to social trends which cover status updates, breath contributions and pressure buttons "I love".
Facebook reports more than 800 million activists. Each of them each day provides three different data from this social network, which makes the term "information supernovation", which is a result of the development of many new researchs. The beginning of the academic works in which the word is given by Facebook has increased the state of a number of five years ago to 800%.
For some people weigh Facebook's bathroom in giving them the opportunity to study people without having to force them somewhere on the street.
"It was earlier paid that when you wanted to make a research between people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should get to the side where you would never leave," says Bartlett.
"This is all Facebook rebuilding -- you just go directly to them."
Others claim that the page can offer a way to identify social and health problems and avoid them.
In a recent study of Dr. Megan Moren from the University of Wisconsin, the research team discovered that university students who had discovered their drinking outcomes on Facebook were much more threatened by alcoholism than students who were silent about this subject.
Morenna intends that the types of students monitor the page and come with a offer for help to the student who publishs too many drinking statuss.
"It can't be difficult to resolve if you can't make it," says Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, together with Dr. Moren and Director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Development of Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We found a way to identify threatened kids who had no chance to discover."
Facebook continues to investigate the data of his own owners.
The information team was developed in relation to related status relations and the day of St. Valentin, elections in 2010 and the coefficient of the pleasure of the people (in particular using information to which they had access - the residents of the Internet freedom already claimed that the site would have access to their information property to research and final).
But Facebook players think that the page is following, whether they like or not - to exchange the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is a thousand miles away, it is necessary to provide your personal information.
But what if Facebook people become part of the research they don't even know about?
Scientists have specific rules on how to store data offline. However, online data are available to everyone.
"I don't think that the people could see their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, sociolog in London Knowledge Lab, about the study of 2006, which he conducted using the public facebook walls of his students.
"When it was about them, they took it so that there are only information between them and their friends."
The following is to consider the question of methodology.
Even in offline research, there is no guarantee that the entity is completely honest.
On Facebook it is not possible to verify how many parts are information on the profile and articles on the wall of the truth.
"What you say on Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook, these are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has performed a long time research of new rubbers, thinks that the complaint and the recorder still remains the best possible tool that can be used for research.
"When you go into the world and talk to people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Community research should be about society and social activities - and the hell of many social activities still play off-line."
"Callow and non-idic": Anders Behring Breivik will take place his first public court
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who was acknowledged to establish two attacks during which the year was killed by 77 people in Norway during his first public court hearing in Osla, he described himself as a battle of "fight".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Movement of Opposition and between the Norwegian temple riders," he announced before the court where 500 people were saved.
"I recognize a meeting against the court because the mandate has given you an organization that supports the hate ideology and supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize my actions, but I don't admit any fault for them."
Judge Torkel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monology because "he didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a podium from which he could report his opinions."
From the same way, Breivik refused, who brought himself the ready word, to enable at the end of the hearing to celebrate his family victims.
Nesheim also commanded the police to keep Breivika in the binding for the next 12 weeks, prohibited him any media through 4 tonnes and announced that the competent authorities would have full control over all its visits and all its correspondences within eight weeks.
The hearing took part of about 30 family victims and survivors.
Some have come in the ability to watch Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure that it is held firmly under the lock.
Everyone was involved in moving the case to quick closing.
"I thought he looked cold and iridish," said the NRK commenter one of the survivor attacks.
"It was nothing pleasant, but I could say to myself, after I saw and heard a suspicious, I was psychically moved a little away."
Breivik, in dark clothes and blue cravate, remained calm and professional for all the time of hearing. When you come and leave to the building without pressing the view of present journalists and survives in the eyes.
Despite Breiviko's strange assumption that it is part of the "opposition" movement, the judge noted that he was a fool and noted that there was no evidence that he had a similar partner.
For someone it may be comfortable that attacks of 22 June seem to be the work of the only extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically decrease the grief and disappointment still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I would like her to look like a creation, which is not like that," said the family of one of the victims.
"If so, it would be much easier."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie in order to film this week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, people who compared him to Henry Ford started to find the views of his geniality by the greatest modern finder.
For the recent discovered Jobs' conversation, which was exhausted for a special movie that is going to film this week, the Apple's fans will be the fact that his creatival mind has completely understanded business processes and workshops that stand for his products.
He was a spectacular designer, snippet and self-called member of the hippie movement, but at the same time also a peep organizer and a person who ships every smallest detail - he believed that many undertakers suffer "the assumption that the great idea is of 90 percent of their job... [but] between the excellent idea and the excellent product is still a long way of work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the Triumf system of computer crazys, who discussed the design of personal computers. During the turning, he played a unique, more than a hour talk.
At that time, Jobs had already ten years since a moment that Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and had full hands of work with his new computer company NeXT, and not long-termly looked at how a broad public will accept the Internet.
Only a short part of the whole Cringely talk was used in the TV series and the interview was concluded that they were lost in the transportation.
However, shortly after Jobs' death, VHS copies were found in the repository garage.
Just this material, quietly covered, is based on the 68-minute picture of Steve Jobs: Lost interview, which meets the selected films this center and Thursday.
On someone who has heard his unfortunateness to provide longer conversations, Jobs acts so surprisedly that he can talk about his philosophy and business strategies.
And it also appears to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the discussion, between the question and the answer will occur a longer pause - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking when it is to see how Jobs' answer is perfectly thinking to be the most exciting and most accurate.
There are even moments when Jobs' perfectionism is exposed to the surface when Cringely's questions act inevitably and encouraging him to reach more important problems and subjects.
The conversation was still surrounded before the era of Pár, iPod or iPhon, and there are too terrible proroctical ideas in it when Jobs value what they do to the final company well and wrong, offering their own vision of the future on the field of computer technics.
One thing is to read the deadly evaluation of Job's career, but on Jobs, which we see here as a breathing snow in the flower of his geniality, is something of syrical and inspiring.
He has his own view of how things can and should look.
It didn't continue, and after he expressed his thoughts, he also began to refer to the practice.
Quick summary of seven scenes of the Lost Interview, which are definitely determined to observe:
How he learned to conduct the business:
"In the years of business, I asked myself, 'Why are you doing this?' and the answer was always the same: 'Well, that's what it's just doing.'
No one knows why he does what he does never thinks about business matters in deepness.
I tried it.
Jobs continues describing his effort to simplify ethnicity in Apple.
He was completely disappointed by the way the costs were mentioned - often began with the title "Standard costs", they could only think about their height. At that moment he decided to walk on his own road - developed automatic tool that ensured that the trade costs could be determined during a minute.
As he performed the wheat on the paper:
Jobs raises on the "Modrow Box" that he built with Steve Wozniak - equipment that allowed people to get into the phone company and call freely anywhere in the world.
This device was already written in the past, but Job’s overcome, when the Blue Box describes as a tool of power, is literally deceived.
Explain how Wozniak and the equipment tested using a payable phone and during the talk were allowed to reconnect from one AT&T network to another while using the largest number of satellites.
"Now at least half-two times we broke around the world, so when we cried something in the pay phone, it was a minute after the second phone at the door," laughs Jobs.
"We were young and we found that we could build a thing that is able to drive the infrastructure for billion dollars throughout the world."
We've made a little thing that could control a lot more - it was an incredible experience and I think it would never destroy Apple without it.
Jobs continues the description of the jacket that they and Wozniak reached the end. In the middle of the blue box in the night they called to Vatican and asked if they could talk to the papa, while they were best published for Henry Kissinger.
They were gradually invited to continue the position of the Catholic Church members to talk to the American diplomate at night, just before the phone was raised up to the phone, two were trying and listening.
How he loved himself to ́ (and phoned with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old and had a replacement to set a range, he found a number in the phone list on Bill Hewlett and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Jobs had already secured an annual brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
"Incrediblely influenced me, it was the only company I knew at that time, and my view of what this company really is and how to behave with her employees."
Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the fire-school professionals in Palo Alto, where he saw "by the table computer that was ever made".
He was big as a cuff, he had a CRT monitor and I just loved inside.
As teenager, I walked up and up in HP, I flatched around the computer and started writing programs.
How the innovation is thinking:
In some places, Jobs talks about how new products are thinking about running.
At the beginning of his career, when he sold a couple of tables with areas, one customer asked him to set up the entire computer for the purpose of it.
He had only 30 payable days available during which he had to find out, install and add prepared equipment.
When he was posted in Apple, he faced the problems they faced in the development of computer mouse:
"I remember how we were wondering... they cried on me that it would last five years [set the mouse that would cost 300 USD] until it stopped me, I went out and found a designer."
In ninety-nine days after we could make a perfect mouse for 15 USD.
As a large company comes to breath:
A long time before he led the Revelation of Apple, Jobs probably foretold that many industrial leaders in his vision were shopping and losing their share in the market.
"Let's say you're working at the IBM or Xerox company, so you're doing better copys or printers, well, and what else?"
You have a monopol on the market, so the company can't be more successful.
At that moment, the marketing is already governed, so the companies lead people who are concerned about this, while people who are concerned about their own products are exhausted from the decision process.
The technology genius that the company has led to its inconsistent position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - the disorder and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened in the Xerox company...
Xerox company could own literally the entire computer industry.
She could be ten times more than it was, she could be Microsoft for ninety-years...
Yet, the victory place they have been able to lose.
As it takes innovation as the form of art:
"It is still a long way and a long way of work... and as the great idea is developed, it changes and grows."
During that time, you're learning a lot about him.
You must access a number of compromises -- some things just electronics, glasses, robots or factors do not.
You have to have a memory of 5000 things - different concepts - and put them in the...
Finally, you're trying to think about the best things that mankind has created, and in a certain way you're trying to dismiss them into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists are copying, but the best artists will steal.
I've never been ashamed of my best ideas.
The Macintosh company was so spectacular and successful because people who worked in it were exciting musicians, basic artists, artists, zoologists, history, and the best computer experts in the world.
Without being computers and new stories, they would be able to make things in the entirely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas dinnered with the anticipation of the health care law at the time of their case.
On the day when the High Court sat behind the closed doors to negotiate a political controversial question whether to accept a meeting against the law of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Guardian Thomas, participated in the celebrated dinner sponsored by a lawyer firm before the court.
The event occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges were gathered to discuss the sentences.
One of the cases discussed was the complaint raised by 26 states that suspicioused the radical processing of health care, which has been approved by the Congress - the law that has mobilised to preserve activists worldwide.
The judges agreed that they would hear the complaint, but in March there are 5,5 hours of negotiation, which will further develop the presidential elections scheduled for 2012 and will be in full course during the issue of the decision.
The question that will stand before the Court and try to get the refusal of law will be with the greatest probability of Paul Clement, who served as the General Prosecutor of the United States for the Government of George W. Bushe.
The Clement's law firm, Bancroft P±C, was one of the two tucts of companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner group, which has already been a long-term exercise of conservative legal principles.
Another company, who sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the commercial associations of suspicious laws, i.e. the National Federation of independent business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical gigant Pfizer Inc, for which they are in the process of a huge financial process.
She was at the Washington Hotel for a few hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
He participated, besides others, including Mitch McCon日, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate and the confirmed anticipation of the health care law.
What about the guests' advice?
It's nothing new: these two judges with the Federalist Society's action group have been a whole year.
And it's absolutely nothing to do with ethical rules.
These judges have the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct which are subject to lower federal judges.
However, their behavior would certainly be under the principle of C4, which says that "the judges can take action that are just associated and other organizations are ordered to obtain financial employment, but the judge must not be a speaker, a honest host, nor should it be mentioned in the action programme."
However, the relationship of Scalia and Thomase with two legal firms in the case, and also with a large financial interest in this case, was rich enough to protect the ethics in the government.
"This shocking breach of ethics and lowliness against the code of behaviour is in contrast with the statement of a number of judges that the highest court acts in accordance with the same rules which apply to all the final federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges have been drinking and dinnering for the Community's benefits together with the legal representatives waiting for the negotiation of their case before the court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining financial financing through this action undergrounds their feet by all undertakings of inappropriacy, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed their criticism only a fashion of understanding and showed them that they also associate their judicial obligations with group action, such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife, Ginni, is highly designed to keep an activist.
Moreover, the conservators suggest that ethical problem is mainly judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor for the Government of President Obama when the first statement against the law had occurred before the court.
Kagan's criticism presses her to say to the case, and he claims that she was fighting for the law as much as she could be inadmissible now.
Kagan's nick didn't mean she wanted to go away.
Boeing Boeing has received a recording ban on aircraft in a value of 18 billion USD
Aerolinks Emirates in charge of 50 double boeing aircrafts Boeing 777 with options to buy 20 other.
Boeing also sells six years of Boeing Dreamliner to Aman Air Links for which he incases more than 1 billion USD.
When a company gets a charge for 50 feet of its products, it is not a deal to celebrate.
However, this company is the Boeing Co Airport producer, and the price of these 50 years makes a record of 18 billion USD, it is something else.
The same important report is where Boeing has received the prohibition from: the Middle East, which grows the gold floor for the future aircraft.
According to the statement issued on Monday, the Chicago company considers that the links on the Middle East will need 2 520 years at 450 billion USD in the next 20 years.
The Boeing company announced its biggest contract in the history about the dollar values for commercial aircraft - 50 double boeing Boeing 777.
The singing order came from the Emirates Siteline in Dubai.
The Boeing company on the 2011 Dubai Air Show announced that the links have the opportunity to buy other 20 airports, so that the total value of the prohibition would result in 26 billion USD.
On Monday, Boeing announced that the Oman Air's links had negotiated six machines Boeing 787-8, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which were very better for the fuel and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six years exceeds 1 billion USD.
"It's about an excellent message for the whole Boeing company," Neal Dihor, analytic for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
A lot of lines on the Middle East belong to more peoples of difficulty.
This means that he has not only money for the payment of the aircraft, but the increase in the price of the weight - mostly damaging links, because it's one of its largest costs - it's not so determining because the country's alone at the highest prices of the flood.
This is important because they are not as probably as in other lines that they can carry or discharge aircraft charges from increased fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such a natural protection," he says.
The Emirates entitles Boeaing's leading position on the market with a wide range of airlines and brings it into the hard company Airbus SAS, which wanted to try to distort Boeing's dominance with its A350 transport model.
The victory of Boeing comes four months after Airbus’s representatives announced that the first year of their largest airport A350, which is a direct competitor of 777-300ER.
It took time for the manufacturer to add the machine to the engine.
The price of Boeing Co action increased by 1.5% to 67.94 USD.
The sister of the Mexican president was alone in Mikoacan elections
Louisa Maria Calderon claims that her counterfeit, Faust Vallejon from Pri, helped the purchasers with drugs in hunger.
The sister Felipe Calderon seems to have lost a poster in Michoacán in violent state elections, and on Monday she declared that one of her opposers to the victory had helped drugs buyers.
Preliminary results have condemned the leading in the Western Valle of Faust's Western elections by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI.
"The rules of the members of organized crime in the entire election process and, in particular, until yesterday the elections are alarming not only for Michoacán, but for all our country," said Louisa Maria Calderon in a conversation for ́dio after Sunday elections.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the group for the investigation of public opinion... they entered the election urnes, built roads... and allowed people to vote for the Pri negotiation.
The Pri Government of Mexico in seven decades until 2000, when the presidency came.
However, it plans to quickly return to power and victory in the elections in Michoacán is a important step in this effort.
Page PRI hopes that he will win in July in the presidential elections.
It seems that Vallejo has hurt Calderon, who has done a day before elections, just very close.
Calderon, the candidate to preserve his brother's National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as a winner.
Third placed Silvano Aureolis, a candidate at the left side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who has yet controlled the Office of Aureolis. For the disappointed and resently investigated party, the presidential elections in 2012 are very disappointed.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results as valid.
Valleja, an ancient main city chairman, named Morelia, rejects and calls for the final candidates to recognize results.
Michoacán was controlled by drug cards specialised on marihuana, heroin and metamphetamine.
It was the birth state of President Calderon and just in Michoacán, in 2006, military fight against winners.
However, violence has survived.
An elder from the PAN, the staff of Luisy Marie Calderon, was killed only a week before elections and many candidates from the elections were dismissed from fear.
However, whatever election results in Michoacán look for the Prie side, victory will help the side to get a new impulse.
The expected representative of Pri in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Neto, welcomed the Wahington Valley and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraged because of the next year."
The ADB bank invites Asia to help save the Euro
The Asian Development Bank invited India and China to be prepared for aid to save Euro'na from its commitment to debt crisis, otherwise the global decrease of the world's economy that would have a negative impact on economic growth in Asia.
Rajat Nag, Director-General of the ADB bank with the seat in Manile, said that two of the growing economics in the world must "do all that is in their powers" to help rebuild the monetary block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the States of Bric group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] followed all European trends "too uninterrupted" and declared that Asian financial assistance in combination with European guidelines and helps to bless global economy.
"We're all in that together."
"So everyone who could help Europe from the crisis," said for Financial Times during the discussion on the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected in a certain way, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should do it."
The European Monetary Association has already been tested for a few months in the course of the debt crisis.
In recent days, the expenditure costs of Italy have been dangerous, and the presidents of Italy and Greece have declined.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised anxiety of re-receiving the global economy, and it has started to discover calls to re-blooming economics and help Euro to find a solution.
Mr. Nag foretold that all Asian support would be addressed by IMF, but noted that the remote aid - such as the purchasing of the Financial Aid Fund for the European Union, the institution for European Financial Stability - would provide more negotiations to the Asian partners of European countries.
Anand Sharma, Indian Commerce Minister, said that "India will do what will be able" to help Europe because her own economy now suffers by the decrease of exports and the decrease of the advancement of the resource.
"No one wants the Euro to remain stability and unbecoming," he declared.
"We're going to go before a hard job and we have to keep a high growth. "
"It's not about the alternative, it's a crazy fact, because they could find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others suggest that developing economics, such as this, have nothing to help European economics when they are required to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult to explain assistance for Europe 1,2 billion Indian people when 800 million of them live from 2 USD or less daily.
"One of them could find out that the Greeks are going to the income in fifty and that they are allowed to use on beaches, which would likely have been difficult to explain to them," he noted.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, has doubted why Indian resources should be used to maintain a well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in wrongly managed and lost sectors, such as railway transport.
Mr. Nag highlighted that the Euro's crisis is threatening "fare dominant effect".
The bank's predict that in Asia, in 2011/2012, to 7.5% of economic growth, now leads to the risk of reduction from Europe's threat.
He announced that the vulnerable development markets must create "unpredictable expenditure plans" to be protected from the decline and significant impact of their economy.
Warning from Pentagon regarding possible defenses
The Defence Minister Leon Panetta on Monday, in Congress, added hardly under a chat when he warned that ridiculers in the budget could threaten national security and call for a financial cycle reaction beginning in Pentagon and continuing through the battle in Afghanistan to civil mounting lines.
The Pentagon will have to take this way to reduce the budget by 450 billion USD during the next ten years, but now the decrease of 600 billion USD is feared if the Congress cannot conclude the agreement on expenditure.
"The impacts of these sticks would be destroying for the whole resort," Panett wrote in the letters to Senators John McCain, Ar'a, and Lindsey Grahams, South Caroline.
He said that the incapacity of the Congress to reach the budget agreement and that such a emergency obstacle will cause 23% of the paused reduction and suspension of many new projects.
"Furthermore, because of such a huge decrease, useful in this unresolute way, you can do the amount of our building or ship projects - you can only buy three quarters of building or ships. Moreover, it could be a serious damage of other modernization efforts," wrote Panetta to Senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since it has decreased to continue so, we will also have to send civils to the deadly permitted, and they were able to fulfil the target requirements."
"These changes can be rejected with the faith of those who care for our army and severely harm her preparation."
Finally, the skulls will also touch war units, he told Panett.
"Despite the financing of possible war operations in the ocean, this situation will not be directly reached, the operations there will be negatively affected by serious changes in the final budgets," Panetta warned.
"There is also in the contracting staff, which will be the result of the delay of contracted contracts supporting the military efforts of our people."
"The states of payable employees will be reduced, which will also increase payments to the suppliers and subsequent violations of legal and political support."
Both Senators repeated the Panett ten days ago and asked him for details about potential impacts on the auto-defence ministerial.
"The surveys of the disturbance of the Defence Ministry could cause degradation of the view of the United States as the world's military power."
"We are extremely against this strong measure," the Senators in the common statement on Monday afternoon announced the Panet's letter.
"It's not the conclusion they've been able to live with, and we're determined not to sign ourselves."
"The planned boxes are a threat to the national security of the United States, which should not be allowed."
"The first will be seen whether Panett's letter and fresh warning will increase the pressure of the Congress to approve the budget and strengthen the votes calling for the release of the Pentagon from the list of embraced Others.
Panetta was recently in discussions about potential clusters who were more deteriorated, although he himself passed to his high position in Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of the budgets in Congress and the White House, so he said that it was to be a battle.
On the printed minute a week, the Minister of Defense indicated a structural image of what his resort can wait - a host of the army, but there will be a mistake of the nuclear.
"It's like a ship without mariners."
"Be as a brigade without municipality."
"It'll be like an airport without school pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, such as a cazarian army, buildings and bombs without enough number of trained soldiers who could end the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of the speaking in Pentagon.
"It'll be like a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to compare with a mighty enemy."
"The results of this will be welcomed by the aggression..."
In the Annex added to the letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, it specifies how decreasing the result of "evident operating risks: late reactions to crisis, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions to the potential of leaders and settlement worldwide; assumed unacceptable risks in future war operations."
Furthermore, the Panetta added that some of the largest defensive projects could wait for the end, including those already tested, and those who are at first in the early stages of planning.
The list, for example, was a project of F35 airport, a planned new bombarder, a balistic pool of a new generation, a new coast battle ship and a new earthly battle vehicle, which wanted the army and the marine coast to replace humvees.
In order to stop further development and testing of F35 airport, 80 billion USD would have been protected during the next ten years, but its staff claimed that it was necessary to improve the army, which is necessary for the country to be organized with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to deal with a lie
The late view of recent newspaper titles indicates how serious and everywhere present are lies and crying in everyday life.
The Republican President's candidate Herman Cain has full work with accusation that he has sexually charged several women - both sides claim that the other lies.
The administrators at the Penn State University were accused of a false witness when they tried to hide the records of that the pennabal trainer had sexually attacked the boy.
Last week the French president Nicolas Sarkozy was welcomed as the launched microphone calls the American President Barack Obam that the Israeli president of the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie was able to destroy the entire career and to include the stability of many countries.
The New York Congressman and the Internet exhibitionist Anthony We's made a deaf man when he published the information that was immediately returned by uncertain evidence.
John Edwards' ex-president candidate was accused of deteriorating the financing from his campaign to try to deal with his unmarried relationship.
And no one will never forget the media cycle that shot around Bill Clinton when he lyed during the second period of his sexual fraction with Monica Lewins.
It's all over here that's just tough stories of school and university.
There are cases when the teachers themselves give their students a test response, just to look well in their businesses.
Mentors who should be repeated send a message that lie and subduction are acceptable.
How many fools do we meet?
See shows that on one day, you're going somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let us assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lost three times during the first ten minutes of the first meeting in life.
Definition lies, or "rekening lies" is the necessary power that everyone should win, either from personal or working workers.
However, it is not a community game that would be similar, let's say, Sharah, when man will say, "I have you". Recognition of the claim is a serious sector of working with the data stored during the last six decades at press universities through detailed research projects, especially in psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that the majority of old myths of lies were rejected.
The liars are quietly in your eyes.
It's not that they'd be kidding, cooking, red, or worrying.
Nevertheless, do not take care of the fact that it is difficult to observe and discover lies.
The schooled identifier of lies can be able to discover the truth from a small building, small expressions in the face, the way to make questions and their time.
I have spent a few years by sharing a deep knowledge from a comprehensive and developing sector of the recognition of lies and it is that discovery of claim is a modern skill that can be learned easily and in a complicated world that can help you very much - especially if your work and obligations belong to the demand, the management of conversations, the negotiation or the leading of people.
The good liars can read well in the rest, let them go in the watch, direct their emotions and intuitively realize how the other side is accepted.
From research, we know that extroverti lies more frequently than introvertising that men's translation of more "autocentral" lies, while women say more lies "related to the final" - a lot to protect some feelings - marriages lie less often to their partners than free people (which is the lie that they say, it's "inexcusable".
We also know that if you are considered a sinner, the finals feel less proud when they lie to you.
How do you know someone lies?
First, take care of the normal behaviour of the entity.
It's called "start observation".
It will make it more easier to see with what to compare.
Take note of the bodies of the entity, his smile, his work with the voice.
You should be sure if someone running continually sticks his feet so that you don't wrongly accuse him of liar only because the meetings are attempting to slip his feet.
Then try to specify the effects of false verbal and non-blahal behaviour.
However, consider it only as a warning signal, not as a evidence of a lie.
People who spend a lie can stop moving the top half of the body when they are trying to remember their outstanding story, the bottles can turn to the door, move to the east, make a significant change of the body's knife or give an "left after the conversation's finish" - overwhelming efficient respiration and change of position when a difficult response is behind them.
People often make a false signal that the interview is at the end only to see how the destruction will look after it ends.
Take note also the language of the entity.
It's fair about how Scott Peterson has ever rejected and used the past time when he claimed that his murdered wife is alive, which has spread the entire country's control of her body.
The claiming units can also say adequately: "I had no sexual relationship with the lady... Lady Lewins" or they're getting the whole question again.
The most current verb characters are only very insensitive.
Someone can use a lot of "needing language" when he answers the question: "Well... to say the truth... of what I know... according to my best domain."
In such a response, we do not know too much of facts and often refer to another warning signal.
There is no shot to discover every lie, but it is possible to gain powers that can help lies.
The help of these powers will have a greater chance that in his personal and workless failure to be a liar and a fooler.
The contradiction plan for the construction of a farmer will be transmitted after the threat of the discharge of approval by the US Government
A few days after the Government of Obam threatened that the approval of a planned farmer from Canada to Mexico Value - which respected the committees against herself, but calmed the environmentalists - the company who had the building of the building for concern announced that it was willing to translate the project so that things would be returned to the movement.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it moved the planned road from the ecological sensitive Sandhills in Nebrasce, and it is convinced that the project would be so approved.
The company notified this Decision at the printing of the Netherlands government.
TransCanada Alex Perbax's staff claims that the company is convinced that the building will finally be approved, although it will carry another road.
This announcement occurred after the last week the Ministry stated that it determined the federal authorisation of the project, from which it did not conduct a study of possible replacement travels that could not be involved in the Sandhills in Nebrasca and in the Water Layer of Ogallala, a broad subterraneous water resource.
"This is the real movement forward," said the Republican representative Lee Terry from Nebraska for Fox News.
The new ecological review of the Ministry would probably take away any decision until 2013, so the year after elections in the next year, but the authorities refused to play a policy role in the decision.
Both, in the written statement of the last week, described the decision as a request for the Ministry, and expressed its support to him.
1 700 miles of long tribe will connect Canada and Mexico Valley.
From Albert's province to the raffinery in Texas, I'm eating 700 000 bars daily.
This way will be necessary to strike six states.
This project hates the environmentalists, but it loves the work of the chats that believes that 200,000 new jobs will be found in the work at the work of the trumpet.
However, the legislators in Nebrasca set up against this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would cause the company to not enter into the Sand Hills region and the Water Layer of Ogallala, the main source of drinking water and inflation.
The current study on the environmental impact, which the Ministry had negotiated, found that the project would only have a small negative ecological impact, but the source of energy industry said that the General Inspector of the Ministry had negotiated a new review of the whole process of study, and focused mainly on two questions.
Once it was that the lobbyist found by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was the adviser of Hillary Clinton in 2008, did not represent the interest conflict.
Otherwise, whether the company invoked for the p's study was not chosen unusually because she had commitments to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused that the bathroom was rejected.
The New Yorkian family claims that the song Patti LaBelle had soon entered into the festival of their Manhattan house and feared their daughter so that she turned away from that fear.
The outcome of the song's hit "Lady Marmalade" feared the 18-month Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "changing personality, disturbing sleep" and "increasing fear of strangers," she said her family in the complaint to the Master Court of Manhattan.
On November 10th, the apparent technician Kevin Monk, his wife, Rosena, the teacher in the school, and Genevieve was able to make a family outcome.
When Kevin Monk arranged a car, Roseons Monk met down to their house in Riverside Boulevard and brought Genevieve with her.
Rosen Monk said she stopped at the door of the châu and set up her child at a moment.
"There was somebody behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "yes" and I went to get her up."
LaBelle's wretched the pregnant woman.
"The aggressive tone told me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," Rosen Monk said.
"I said to her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She was disappointed and started talking directly -- she was speaking the most simple expressions...
She had a laugh with water with herself, and she started taking water after me.
He says Genevieve got histerical relief.
"I said to the woman, "See what you did to my daughter."
LaBelle was on her mother - who still had Genevieve in the hands - and had to stop her until her deliverance, who then moved her to the waiting car, answered Rosiones Monk.
The daughter was so shooting as much as she returned, and she added.
After all, the family sent a letter in which LaBelle requested excuses, but they had no answer.
LaBelle can't respond to our phones so that they can't get up to the whole box.
The complaint demands closer to the unexpected, but family legal representative, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken freely and that the family plans all the lodged money to promote a charitative organization with a child with cancer.
"The goal is to offer Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for its start," said Davis.
"This behaviour is totally inacceptable, especially if it's intended to be against a teacher from the school holding in a 18-month child's hand."
The economy has disappointed the climate
During the first year of the government, Maria López Valdez increased unemployment and unemployedness in Sinaloa, increased investment and economics with them
In 2011, it is the first year of the Government of Maria López Valdez, who is called a government of changes. This government has made a great expectation with herself regarding economic progress, however, from the inappropriate climate changes at the beginning of the year, no growth has been mentioned and has even reached the decrease of the main economic development indicators.
Low hour temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, have limited the possibility of growth in the state economy, having a conscious reduction of the economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year, which has resulted in historical decrease of 31.16%, which has distorted the dynamic and other economic sectors.
According to the reports of the caused damage issued by the Mexican Council for sustainable development of foreigners, the damage was designed to 582 835 hectares processed ground, from which 78.03% was completely destroyed and at the remaining 21.07% were discovered partial damage.
The decrease of economic activity to November caused constant growth of unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Employment and Geographical Logistics, the rate of unemployment in the State mentioned during the first three fourths. Since January to March, 55 053 people were unemployed and reached 6,19%, which represents approximately 74,000 unemployed people.
Less liquidity
According to Gerarda Lópeze Cervantes, the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Facility is possible to explain the growth of unemployment indirectly on the basis of the steps carried out at the level of public policy.
"We are witnesses of growing unemployment, relating to different factors, among them belongs to the loss of liquidity on the market from the limitation of resources in the light of the legislation which has approved the conference in relation to the fight against spending money. For people who are illegally forced by dollars, it is not easy to make them, invest them or use them for something," he stressed.
Suspension
López Cervantes noted that in the growth of unemployment the demographic factor was also shared.
"The beginning of those who depart for work in the town, in the United States, has decreased, however, from an inevitable entrance, and then also because, even though these people get outside the border, it is difficult for them to get jobs.
Incompatibility
An analysis of the work market in Sinaloa is also deteriorated from the growing incapacity controlled by workshops.
In this administrative territory the lowest payments of the country are added to employment and unemployment, as indicated in the registrations of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Work and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was in September 5, 352 pessets, deeply under the national average, which moves to part 7,375 pessets.
Reduction of direct insurance investment
In combination with the decrease of economic activity and the growth of unemployment, in 2011, the most significant reduction in direct investment in the past 10 years was mentioned. According to the Ministry of Finance, the financial period from January to June has reached directly 630 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74% of the decrease of 5 143 312 dollars for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State has invested 17,280 million pessettes per year.
Manual
With regard to the scenario of economic reduction, the Government of this State requested in July a State congress to approve a loan of 3 billion weights, which would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 cities for the purpose of the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2.600 million weights. In November there were no profits from debt, not in any sector of the State economy.
Reaction
According to the representatives of the business sector, Mary López Valdése pointed out the lack of government ability.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Com of the Transformation Industrie, declared that in 2011 the voluntary of individual sectors, including the Government of the State, was missing.
"We have to work intensely on it during this year, and we have got back the land we lost in the year. In 2012, we have to double our efforts, we have missed the harmonisation of our efforts, and especially the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let us hope that the next year will be much better," said.
Economy Slowness
Loredo López noted that events as frozens at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a series of tasks, other than the frogs. One of the main results was the delay of the economics that were not enough to remember to resume dynamicity that would enable the admissible movement of processes, products and services, and therefore we experienced deeply at the end of the year under expected forecasts," he said.
Redefinition of transmission
According to Salazara Uriarte, President of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa Employment Conference, it is necessary to touch the state of more dynamic production activities.
"We generally note that it works, and we believe that it is necessary to prepare a plan to be redefined the objectives and economic coherence of the state because it is important to mobilize all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work that's before us
President Coparmex highlighted the importance of setting a future view that would better lead to the government's efforts.
"I would generally say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, in the economic development has achieved some progress, but it is important to create a plan," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the leading of public policy.
"There are elements that enable the government to try to be privacy. I can say that it is here to see the work made and I believe that the government is the idea that it is also a lot of work before us," he said.
Country for 8 kg of marihuana
The population of Navoato was sentenced to five years of destruction and 100 days of repugnation for eight kilos of marihuana.
The general prosecution of the Republic informed that the dealer dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was condemned for the criminal health threat, particularly for the driving of marihuana for trade.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by mexican armies on 7 June 2010 at the street of Cipriano Valdez, against the station 80 in the quarter of El Castillo, Navolato.
Dealer had a black packet in the car in the cottage and a small bathroom in the seat. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of marihuana 23 grams.
In these cases, the insured man remained available to the Judge of the Second Section and the management remains inside the Centre for the implementation of legal effects of criminal acts.
Debts for projects
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Habitat, Saving public places and 3x1 for ́ntors, are dangerous that they are affected to the end or that they will have great delays from the lack of economic resources, Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of the Civil Social Development stated that if the building work has yet gone forward, it is now threatened that the State government is able to secure the relevant deliveries required by over 11 million weights for three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes is nearly 50 million weights. The state is 25%. It has only been added to the Federation and the city until this time, so it is possible that the implementation of projects will be late.
"They have to get 12 million, and even though the year goes to the end, we haven't got anything at all, and even though we had to get part in July," he said. "And they didn't work time, we started projects and continued very nicely, but we missed money."
He noted that in the remote year for Jesus Aguilar Padilla's administration, he did not comply with the relevant supplies, so at the beginning of the new period, he had to ask the city for a loan so that it could be able to charge more than 7 million who had not been governed by the State.
"The fact has happened to us in the past sixteenth period because the state had no economic capacity to reach and the programmes went further, and this year we had to get to the programmes mentioned, we had to get the things that would cover what has not been done," he explained.
Despite the fact that there are promises by the State representatives relating to the transfer of these resources, he noted that the request was sent to Armmand Villarreal, the Secretary for Administratives and Finances to facilitate the management and the corresponding percentage had reached the first time.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million, and although the year is close to the end, we haven't got weight yet."
The Court of Justice approves "the end of the analogue sending" in Mexico in 2015
Replaceing analogue signals with digital signs is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in the past years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) refused the constitutional complaint submitted by Senate and the Missionary against the presidential decree, which wanted to accelerate the "switching of analogue signals" and to perform it in 2015 in place of 2021. He noted that there were no eight votes necessary for it to be dismissed.
Minutes of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juana Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed his power when he issued a decree in which individual steps were introduced, which would lead to a transition to the earthly digital television.
With this exam, the claim submitted by the Senate was refused because the eight votes had not been achieved so that the court could be sent to the constitution or inconsistency of the said decree that remains valid.
In the sentence of the Ministerial Deputy Olgou Sánchez Cordero presents the opportunity to declare a decree for non-constitutional, since regulations of all issues relating to division and television are the matter that is replaced by the Federal Telecommunication Commission (Cofetel) by law, which is so to violate the principles of hierarchic subordination and the exception of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero were voted for the project.
With this argument as Senat, the Missionary sponsor supported the constitutional dispute in trying to fight against the decree. Minister Sanchez Cordero adopted requests and stopped the application of the decree and all the actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitalization.
The Meeting of Ministers has also decided to refuse the complaint given by the Missionary to be prompted without entering the debate on our concerns, as well as the Ministry of Sánchez Cordero.
In its presentation, the Minister stated that it was not accurate with arguments of advice in the meaning that the Federal Executive cannot structure by the general standard of measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if it did, it would have touched the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and he reminded that the planning of public policies in strategic aspects such as the telecommunication sector is a federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the coherence of the state.
The replacement of analogic signals with digital is one of the biggest changes that the world has experienced in the past years. It relates to better use of radio-electric spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
It seems that the change would mean to remove the benefits from digitalization, which requires decisions on public interest, which are not only technical dimensions, but also "think of economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he highlighted, these questions "require the operation of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of the economic control of the State, which includes the entire number of competences that the Constitution believes in the hand of the government of the State".
He recalled that a number of countries throughout the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and acted so through its governments, even though there were highly specialized technical authorities.
He noted that it was impossible that the Government, by granting an inappropriate decree that consists in a certain measure of the powerful conference, would lead to the administrative compliance with laws prepared for legislation.
In Michoacán, they analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data published by PREP, the range between the first and the second place in the electoral options is 27 per cent. The votes of 879 of 6074 election areas have not yet been calculated.
The possibility of calculation of "vote after vote" was shown in the annual elections in Michoacán, where, in accordance with the data published by the Previous Election Results Programme (PREP), the division between the first and the second place in the electoral electors of 27 per cent has not yet been started, in accordance with the 879 of the total 6074 election areas.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Election Institute in Michoacán (IEM), Maria de los Angleles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that the electoral authority had approved a number of measures to harmonize local standards with the federal election reform.
As noted yet, Michoacán did not officially confirm his political establishment or its State election code or Law on Election Justice. The State Congress approved reforms soon before the legal period for their entry into force still in this electoral period, and the Leonel Godoy Rangel reminded their publications in the time specified in the Official Court of Justice Act, with the fact that he had an accommodation against them.
On November 9, the Highest State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislation powers and announced the voice of the State's head in the matter of constitutional reforms for "invalid and illegal", because it has no right to "approve or vet."
On the question of the possibility of counting "vote after vote" María de Los Langeles answered that by the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of IEM it would be possible to carry out the local electoral authorities partly and the total calculation.
In this way, the partial number of votes, one or more electoral packages, can be carried out after the following submins: optional results are unconcorded; there is no record of the number of votes and calculation in the corresponding box or no chairman is given to it; or if it has occurred to errors and obvious injury of election results.
Furthermore, the total number of votes in all elections can be carried out if there is an indication confirming that the division between the potential victory of election and the candidate on the other hand is smaller or equal to one percent point; if at the beginning of the session, the representative and/or the coastal will be demanded at the second place.
The total number of votes can also be carried out when, after a correct summary, the difference between the probably victory and the candidate on the other hand is equal or less than one percentage point and also when there will be a statement request for the political party whose candidate has completed in the second place. In this case, the optional packages in which the partial calculation has been carried out will be arranged.
It is necessary to mention that there are options in Morelia, where the PREP is a division between the first and the second place of 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral areas have not yet been counted.

A new Italian government will be appointed in the center
The named President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet the Italian President tomorrow to present him a new government that will lead to the crisis that this country holds over the loss of the economic disaster.
The named President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet the Italian president tomorrow to present him a new government that will lead to the crisis that this country holds over the loss of the economic disaster and which has led to the risk of the entire euro.
The Chairman's palace reported that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet President Giorg Napolitano in the middle to confirm that he could create a government.
It is expected to represent the government a majority of technocrates, even though it is not yet clear when the new government is taking power.
Monti announced that he would represent the president the outcome of his discussions that he led with political parties in trying to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this kind of phase," said the former European reporter Commissioner.
Monti didn't explicitly say that he could create a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were convinced.
"The frame is now well designed," he added.
Monti has completed the government's creation within three days, so much shorter than it is usual, while Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has resulted in a higher debt at an inconsistent level.
The new administrative guided by the former European Commissioner Montim must approve a strong package of sustainable measures required by European leaders, which will only be possible to restore the confidence obtained in Italy.
In Monti, a large pressure is developed to accelerate. For the stability of markets, the rate of the Italian BTP debt has exceeded a decade of 7 percent limits, the level where Greece and Ireland have to ask for salvation.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Employers Organization of Confindustrie, said to journalists after meeting with Montim: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this inflammation.
Montiho na ́e successfully multiplied by the support of the PDL Silvia Berlusconi, which the crisis brought to rejection on Saturday.
"We believe that the effort of Professor Monti's is intended for good outcomes," said the journalists Angelina Alfano, the secretary of the Mediterranean.
The PDL support, the largest Italian party, is important, since until this moment, a number of members of its members have been set up against the government with the technocracy which Monti is composed.
Parliament's support
The new Monti Government must have a strong support for Parliament to promote non-armed sustainable reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in that effort may lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Foreign Banks Association added to pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti started negotiations with political parties, committees and business groups, youth and women on Monday.
When the deal ends on Thursday night.
Monti was appointed by the president of Napolitan on Sunday, which enabled a very-successful process in reaction to the crisis.
After a short decrease from the end of the last week, when the Berlusconi was already obvious of demission, the rate of the Italian debtors returned to the critical border and thus reacted to the uncertainty of whether the new president of the Government is successful.
To save Italy, whose public debt moves to 1.8 billion euros, it would be over the possibility of current euro financial reserves.
Monti announced that his government should keep at power until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite general prognoses that claim that politicians only give him time to implement reforms and then declare preliminary elections.
Monti pointed out that it would have entered the policy into its cabinet, but the large market party would have to be charged by the Government only from experts to bring Italy out of the hatred that the country had received from the financial pressure.
Political resources have stated that distant uncertainty and disapproval among the parties are complicating attempts to join governments and political persons.
Spanish with international stocks more frequently than Costa Rica
Of 22 Spanish Balists, ten exceeds 50 international stocks.
On the side of Kostarica only one of the 22 players called up to 50 stores.
Great contrast on the side of Kostarica, if we compare 22 players of both countries who have meet today on a friendly shot at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and Europe, the number of a monthly FIFA rating, has a wide range of inter-evolutions of class A, Kostarika has only Michael Uman's defense, who played as the only 50 international stocks.
This number reached the past Friday at the campaign against Panama (0-2) at the stadium Rommel Fernández.
Spanish Ballists playing in the East Stars and in the powerful Clubs of the first League, holding intense activity over a year on liquor championates and households and high-level shoes in Europe's shapes such as Champions League.
We must also add experiences from the national Spanish team in complicated exhibitions on European and world championate.
Costaric players have much about the options for employment stocks in Âi. It is here, for example, Concacaf, which is considered as the lowest level in the FIFA.
We see that the biggest number of Spanish representation reliefs has on his account Iker Casillas, who has reached the former Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international challenges before England (progress 0-1 in London).
Casillas will also take up today against Costa Rica and get a new record for Spain - 127 international shops.
Xavi Hernández, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 storages on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced for a week along with other Spanish players who have hundreds of stocks on their account. In addition, Zubizarret has already been mentioned with 126 and the Middle attacker Schalke, Raul González, with 102.
Hundreds came close to Carles Puyol with 97 stores.

The best shooter of Spain is David Villa with 50 ≥ and follows Fernando Torres with 27.
On the coast side, Brian Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quentheto included the country in its tour at the opportunity of celebration 20 years of existence
"The way to Kosovo is a dream that becomes awesome."
In the exclusive conversation for Viva, Jeff Ament based on Pearl Jam said that the group was ready next Sunday to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium.
We've been waiting for more than 20 years, but the same group assures them that the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a complete dream.
That's what the baset and the funding member Jeff Ament spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South America continent in the tournament at the 20th holiday of existence and will be on Sunday 20th a single station in Central America.
This day will come from 19:30 to the National Stadium together with the English group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a show of the conversation that you will find the whole record on the La Nation pages on the Internet.
You know what your fans will eat?
The way to Kosovo is our dream that becomes awesome.
In South and Mediterranean, we were at the same time a good experience.
I've been in Costa Rica only once, for allowed, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to live here for a few days.
So we have a great joy we can bring you our music.
I wonder, because there's a group of letters who love, the fans are spending these days very intensely.
What do you say to your most lowly guests?
Thank you for being with us a lot of years.
It's been 21 years before we arrived in Kosovo.
Some people are talking about a concert already as the biggest show of the year.
Does that make you feel more pressure?
Some of the biggest shows we've preached in the last 21 years have appeared in a few weeks in the horizon.
We had a few wonderful shows in Sao Paul, and we hope that we got to the form of a concert in Costa Rica.
We really enjoy the concert.
We love this country, we serve, we like jungle, and for both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Kosovo and her walls suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfair friends and a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends drive to surf in Kosovo or in Nikaraguy, or in Mexico. These are the best places for surfing, and so we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan on your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we never played here, we have no restrictions that we couldn't do.
We'll take the best show with various tracks.We'll play a couple of songs from each album and present our fans a good and different repertor.
You're never repeating a repository.
Why?
I think partially it's because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 tracks and everyone has other tracks, so it's hard to choose what songs we're gonna play every night.
When we have two three songs we haven't played in the repository, we'll focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked that and we may have forgotten it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour you celebrate 20 years of art roads.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you have done?
Yeah, sure.
First, I think no one of us could imagine we're in one large rock group and we're staying in it over 20 years, it sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given and he thinks we can still play together.
We've got a music, and we're making a music.
We're lucky to look at the places we've been able to.
We couldn't get better.
What did you mean that you were a major part of the appearance of the grong genre?
It was always the honour for us that we could be part of this group, in which they are represented by themselves.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when movement comes from a group of friends, it's not very often happening.
Since time, a group will appear in the city, but it is much less habitual to get five to ten groups from one city.
We're proud of it and we're honest that we can be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we're still playing with somebody.
Last year, we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on the tour. We're lucky that they're all our friends and honors us that we can be part of this movement that appeared in Seattla.
It is also very unusual that the group as yours continues to be a group and have the same members after these years.
Yes, we four have been together 21 years ago, and Matt (Cameron) has joined us 13 years ago, which is a very long time about itself than the usual duration of the group.
I think we all have the happiness that we are still in this world and our second role plays the fact that we are still interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and thanks to this, we have been able to open the musical ways that allows everyone enough freedom to have his own experiment.
We believe each other, we appreciate the music of the other, and I think it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find the balance?
As we grow up, it was gradually more easier to find equality.
We're not trying to get too on the tour, because it's very easy to fall into this feast of gifts and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, remember that you have to respect music and what you have given them. You should not be allowed to enter you by being famous, rock stars. This is never really interested in us.
How do you get up to the next project Mother Love Bone?
I think we've written great songs, and at first it was something big.
As a capelle, we had three years and never had any albums after Andrew Woods died.
It was very frustrating because it was so long. The most important is that today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Gregem (Gilmore), who started in the chapel with us. When I listen to a song or look at the song, I take up on Andy how incredible I was asking him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, to smile, to talk about music or music and many others.
It was an incredible person, and we missed much.
The National Chapel Las Robertas will be convinced by starting a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their job, namely Eddie Vedder, and that you've chosen them as pre-speaking?
Yes, the production sent us videos with some of us, and this group was most liked us, so we know what Las Robertas would offer and have to be very fun.
Why're you changing Yellow Ledbetter?
That's the question of Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He's sing to her and I think he's adding the first thing he's gonna attack him.
Who affects you as a base?
It's a lot of people.
I'm first attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so much for them that I could talk about the basic teams I like.
How did Pearl Jam keep the grong, although he's not in the mode?
I think we've all felt easily separated from the Grenga word.
When it comes to Grunge, I'll imagine the groups I mentioned like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the rest that appeared at the same time. And if this music is still valid today, it's something great because it's a music that is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney today play a better music than ever before.
At the beginning, your music had a easy shadow character and now it's more positive.
What's this change worth?
It's interesting because I feel that in the new album there are some tracks that are easier racing, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very humble, even though they can be seen as a position.
At both of them, when Ed played them to me, I wept, and they're deeply dark.
I think if you grow up and have a trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or friend, these things will affect your art and music, and these two songs just represent me.
I also think you can be a happy man and even make a humble music.
Peru:
Fuymori has been hospitalized again due to medical tests.
The former president Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in the public hospital on Tuesday, where he was tested from the dâ swal loss he suffered in the bottom of the finals, he informed his medical doctor.
72-year Fuymori, who is deprived of 25 years of freedom of human rights violated by his government (1990-2000), suffers from some diseases, including the cancer of the language, which has been operated four times and has already been controlled by doctors at the moment.
Sender Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, said the TV station Canal N that Fuymori will undertake tests at the National Institute of Displaced diseases for three days, where they should find out why he is painful and why the loss of powers in the bottom of the conceits.
Aguinaga said that, according to his opinion, Fujimori could have mercy from humanitarian forces, however, the former president himself doesn't have mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times for the cancer of the language, he decided 18 kilograms, and other diseases were added to these problems as a heavy erosion of gastritis, cystas on the slider, renal stones, high pressure and both problems in the feet, and he called the doctor.
Fujimori has rejected the penalty since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years of death for 25 persons who killed the murderer of the army who acted illegally in the first years of his government.
Music at the visit of Mexico to strengthen political relations
The official delegation of the president of Uruguay, José Mujica, which has been delivered by several ministers and undertakers, starts on Monday visit of Mexico, which aims to achieve the expansion of trade between both nations and to touch the political subjects of the region.
The music is in the middle of its Mexican Protestant, Felipe Calderon, which is the most important meeting of a full meeting with the representatives of the political, trade and representatives of the Uruguay community living in Mexico. The Uruguay presidential office has published the program.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajar will serve to exchange information on political matters between both countries," published the Uruguay presidential office on its websites.
According to local communications, Mujica will try to take Calderón to support Uruguay in relation to France when the French president Nicolas Sarkozy organized a country of yooame to the list of tax collectors at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In its statement of Sarkozy, he threatened that the countries that will continue to remain in the position of taxes will be separated from the international community, which has resulted in a rejecting position from Uruguay and the consequences with the prosecutor in this European country.
Mexican President G20 from November. G20 is a group created by the most powerful developing and developing countries of the world. With the Latin countries mentioned, it has concluded an agreement on exchange of information that will prevent the double opinion from January of this year.
The Uruguay Government has recently pursued a specification of the fiscal exchange agreement with the aim of obtaining the "Black Charter" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which have not implemented all required international standards for tax cooperation.
From the commercial view of Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has been closed, which has increased the exchange of goods between both countries.
Your installer runs 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario is already more than 25 years in the fight to save Princess Peach from Bowser's wounds, but he has never seen in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of a girl with a stereoscopy.
The title that comes this month into all trades throughout the world has already been created from the beginning to use all characteristics that offer the transmission of Nintendo 3DS console that allows playing three-dimensional games without to use brilliant.
"Mario is a statute that must say how stereoscope is to operate without brilliant," introduced the worker of the print specialized at Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez noted that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "a video game of Nintendo designed specially for this nose", since until this moment successful photos such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adapted to existing titles.
The speaker Nintendo noted that the video is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Available" video game that allows it to enjoy a gas and gas partition.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "easy", whose task is to attach less furniture.
As soon as you convince this level, you can leave to the "three wheel" at the levels that are more important this time.
Moreover, they can choose real time between "agressive D" or one who only affects the depth of action. But it will be necessary to play 3D so that you can overcome the most different challenges and "no submit to optical clothes".
This new Super Maria in 3D also assumes the return of the transfer stations to the console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays notes to those who follow and repeat a successful formula from the previous parts. It suggests that the installer of yourat man will have to go through dangerous platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movements, areas, overflows and also between enemies, it also appears "playing" Luigi.
Column authorised the issue of Portilla to the United States
President Álvaro Column announced on Wednesday that he had made steps to issue the former President Alfonse Portilla, who had to be responsible for the destruction of 70 million dollars in the United States.
This is the end of the process, aimed at answering Guatemala to the request of the northern country that requests the issue of Portilla to be able to judge him.
In the printing, Colom confirmed that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judicial and executive power and that he remembered that the Court of Justice has already ordained an issue.
He assured that during his mandate, he was "not attached" to the court decisions and allowed all the issues he had received on his table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will be issued for murder and harmful health pollution and Edgar Esdra Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trade.
The step of Colombia is the step of the execution after all the judicial and constitutional institutions have been exhausted to conduct the process against the former president who was governed in 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Court of Justice and the Court of Constitution (CC), Portugal will be issued after its law will be resolved in Guatemala and will be ensured to keep human rights.
Portillo was considered innocent in the case of 120 million in the Defence Ministership during its presidency. This process was previously released, but the Public Ministry revoked and returned the case to the game.
Trinity helped 6000 young people in threatening
The organization has developed to help children without education so that they don't feel at the border of the company.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of the social aid organisation of Trinia is very important: 6.000 young people who have threatened social extinction have been helped.
It is necessary to join hundreds of jobs that have been obtained for this social group.
The yesterday year also served to represent the balance of the festival act which was played in the former production sites of Fabra and Coats and who was involved in more than 300 persons.
The Trinity Organization appeared in the fourth Trinitat Vell in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug dependencies or with social distortion.
At the yesterday meeting in San Andreu, a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions cooperated in the past 25 years with association.
A variety of political representations, at election time, showed the unity of the work that Trinia is performing.
With the President-Generalitat, Arture Masem, and his predecessor Jordan Pujolem participated in the Festival Act, an ancient socialist adviser for education, Ernest Maragall, and the former age and the current ecologically-socialistic Council Ricard Goma.
The current adviser for social welfare and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of Social Work in La Ca, Jaume Lanaspa, also delivered to the large Chamber of Fabra and Coats.
Mas said that Trinia had occurred in a very difficult time and that today's time also cleared a series of interruptions, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day was "good foundation".
The President introduced Trinia as an example of how it is possible to fight against an improper circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis isn't for this organization and for the work he's doing, I'm going to do nothing new," he said.
It happened to move a carrying house where giant festivals were organized
The shooters owned 11 of 13 apartments in Balmes, 51.
12 employees left the house yesterday in the south without resisting
Everything testifies that the nightmare of the neighbors of number 51 in Balmes Street is finally at the end.
Twelve people yesterday willingly leave the building that they were illegally inhabited and where they organized the giant festivals that were neighbors. They left the building from the Court Regulation without having to include the police.
After the end of the operation, the lock on the door was changed to prevent repeating.
"From this moment the input will be guarded," said the manager.
The occupants who took 11 out of 13 apartments in the building - remaining inhabitants - took all electric and partially and water equipment, and switched the walls and left all kinds of waste, especially poultry after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments, a great party was held up to two days, and the final payers were raised.
Near the building is a discoteca, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europe Press that the markets were decreased by 80% since the building was occupied.
The owner of the discoteca emphasizes that the building buyers have made some competition because they sold drinks for 3 euros, where there is 10.
Furthermore, the owner of the enterprise had to respond to complaints of neighbors for the sound. Because the problems were not affected by the visitors of the discoteca, but by the people of the home, and especially those who attended here ordered festivals, whose frequency and intensity has grown in the last weeks, according to divorced populations of the environment.
The owner of the discoteca explained that the problems were so big that they even agreed with the owner of the building, and they forgive their reward for nine months.
The town police also confirmed that during the last weeks she had received more tissues from the neighbors to the country.
Alberto Fernández Díaz, president of the city group of the PP people at the Council, requested that "the building be moved immediately and related to the problems of civil suffering that the neighbors suffer and the destruction."
The president of the people explained that only one trial had been taken ago, but in the past months, the occupants had reached all the fathers of the building and even all the apartments, and in one of them even had been stealed.
In this way, he added that "the need to be related to insatisfactory and to be effective if it is the effects of civil responsibilities that have occurred in the building."
The city police also held a building in New Barris yesterday.
At 15 hours of 30 minutes, the police arrived in the 35th building on the Mont-Ral Street after the neighbors called her, who saw the building of four people.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountains?
The architects meet at the opportunity of entering procedures which are more than the polemics of honoraries
The town election procedure on 16th opens a debate on the role of the Collserol park in Barcelona.
In the middle of the 80s, during the largest flower of Corporation Metropolitan de Barcelona (CMB), this self-submission printed several pampflets for the support of the Collserola park.
The flight defined the mountain as a big metropolit park of Barcelona.
Moreover, he was filled with digital comparison with the non-Work Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the thinking of many like the top border of Barcelona. The Catholic metropole is one of the small ones that are not oriented north - north, but up (horn) - down (sea).
Qualification of Collseroly as a natural park goes in this direction.
References were no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wilds instead of Yogi's beverage.
This was the position until September when the Council announced the mega concurrence of 16 complaints to the same amount of entry into Collserola.
Of course, the gate burns more thoughts of the park.
Be this, or someone's trying to put the gate on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or hour?
During the competition, as well as purely organized, as well as on the basis of the town's reflections, this question becomes the central subject of all Barcelona teams.
It is already the same delicate as if two members of this old box selected at the meeting in the box are given their hands.
And this is just that he has chosen one of the rare agreements between three Barcelone teachers and a representative university teacher.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection procedure has its delay.
According to Roldana, after the question of the guilty party began, "this must also be discussed about "the mountain side", so the declaration Ildefonse Cerd on green eggs was not addressed to the end.
"We have to get out of the principle that the most clear Barcelona park is the beach.
In addition to my great availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the tech for which the name "brows to Collserol" is "lexicological past" in itself: we can't imagine them "as income in the park, but more as a range where it is possible."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experiences from the world of urbanism, is a "intelligent challenge" which reports "any danger".
The danger resulting from the "invalidity that presents today the project of public place" after the experience of the 80s, which had in the Forum "the Lab of Song" in Forum.
By fear it is the same limitation of the border where it should be built.
"Nothing to determine means to do another step," it's in principle to move on the step next.
"The new urbanism and planning tools must be remembered because the current (with reference to the General metropolitical Plan (PGM)) can cause a fair funeral."
If we are more detailed to the question, the Modol thinks that the potential suh Collserola can be "park", but the Barcelona part is not even, and it's from the pure topographics.
Modol also reminded that there is already a work that Patronat de Collserol has carried out, which "not can end on the waste," even though he welcomes that the adviser offers his range that he will take into the project from "for a minute".
In addition, he understands that near the mountain and the city is a likely permission that allows the teachers to be involved in the debate, but "the doubts" that it should be just this technical profile that will lead to a multidisciplinary team ("they're all about skills"), which must be created: "Architects should be only tools."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question the name of this game is complicated because there is a missing global view of Collserola: "16 choice procedures were reported that killed all the mountains of the sea, but there is no subsequent study that would look at and understand it as a whole."
This causes at least he, registered in all 16 election procedures.
Otherwise, the project of one gate can lead to the concept and definition of the neighborhood gate.
According to his opinion, the advisory should ensure that the aircraft of Ronda de Dalt should ensure the whole length of the area of equipment that would enhance the gastrointestinal transition between the city and the green.
Casino passed by Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of prison, the legal officer Cadino Red gave the favor to the brother of the elderly Monterrey in the process in which he was traced for a demanded exhibition.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal spent in 72 days and now will be released after the law forced officer Casino Red gave him mercy before the Second Court of Justice in the circle that negotiated the case of a division in which the elderly brother of Monterrey was accused.
After an atent to Casino Royale owner of Casina Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas had to ask for the payment of the economic quota to allow the council in Monterrey illegal operations in the building house.
After public accusation, the State prosecution started the penalty of the brother of the panist. On September 2, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours in front of the Public Ministerial Agency, the number 3 for the ownership of crimes was transferred to section 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the main city of the State.
In this place, he remained 49 days after the second regulation was issued to the prison and the public ministerial officer had the opportunity to participate or organised crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadreyt for suspecting the owners of Casina Red by one and a half million weights. However, only a few hours remained in the area with a middlely difficult supervision because he was threatened by death.
The leading representatives allowed him to stay in the cities of San Nicolas de los Garza during the process.
On October 25, an order was submitted to the arrest by the Secretary of the During Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who declared that at the same time after two months of investigation, sufficient evidence that allows Jonas to prove the guilty. The evidence includes, for example, the payment of 1,5 million weights to the representatives of the casino in exchange by the promise that the operation would be allowed.
On Monday, the legal officer Casina Red, Victor Aldo García Gomez, delivered to Judge José Luis Pecin and requested mercy for the elderly brother of the region. On the basis of this, it will be possible to return to freedom.
During the legal negotiation with the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias asked García Gomeze whether they were harmful and who of the partners decided to give mercy.
On the basis of the Official Journal of 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is granted legal grace. In the process that was against him, there is no complaint to be given. It is also impossible to ask for damage or penalty.
After overcoming the legal powermaker about 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábala Breton.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanéz, came to the officer in San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted official mercy and his case was sent to the archive.
He also announced that the judge had issued immediate regulations for his release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jacome presented details about the air accident in which the secretary, Francisco Blake, and the other seven persons died.
The Secretariat for Communication and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which the Secretary of the Government of Francisco Blake Mora and the other seven others indicate that the wheeler had been influenced directly on the area full of power, without the pilot to try to reach the needed arrival.
At the printing Dionisio Pérez Jacome, a secretary for Communication and Transport, stated that before the start of the airplane, the pilot found that climate submissions allowed for years.
"The parts that are discovered testify that the unit has come into contact with the territory several times, the wings have entered into the woods of 25 meters from the place where the unit has lost."
He also informed that the entity was appointed for 19 persons, therefore complied with all requests for the transport of staff.
Furthermore, he noted that there were no parts on the ground based on the investigation carried out in the event.
"In the search, it was found that parts of the aircraft were not located in another place, so the aircraft arrived as a celister.
"The wallet was appointed for 19 persons, complied with all the requests for transport of persons.
The teren shows the swimming of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary noted that at the moment it is the most important to get the most outcome. However, investigation may take a few months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aviation and Aid Services, announced that at the moment of the arrival the presidential Chamber was moved to the airport and that there was an accident on a mild emergency territory.
"That information supports the hypothesis that during the accident, it was about a transitional operation," he said.
At the printing of the SCT Pérez Jacome representative, he appointed six basic points of investigation:
Visual years:
In accordance with the aircraft standards, the year has been carried out in accordance with the rules of the visual plane, which means that the post must be seen in the field during the year.
Meteorological submins:
The AICM report refers to the added submissions at the start, in accordance with this aircraft, in line with the border direction, between DF and Mexico State, the layers were dark in low highs.
Selected paths:
It is probably that the dark department was looking for lower and more visible to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the trailer.
The coordinates of the speed and the last record of the radiator are agreed, and it is likely that the loss of control has not occurred before the end or the breakdown of the flight trailer.
Distortion of aircraft residues in a limited territory:
The information that we have now available is enabled to assume that it has occurred on the same tracker and on the side.
The dilution of the rest of the aircraft indicates that the whirlwind was clergy during the time of the speed on peın.
It wasn't a fire or an explosion.
There were no evidence in the place of unfortunateness that would testify of the explosion or fire.
The final outcome of the investigation shows that there could be several contacts with peʹna.
During the territory work, the rest of the aircraft was found up to 9200 degrees above the sea, the territory is covered, the highest level is from seven to 30 degrees.
Photographs indicate the clusters that probably have occurred in the deterioration of the road.
The information provides elements that, as it seems, indicate that the whirlwind could be contacted with the country at some places.
After a careful surrounding in the surrounding of the accident, there were no residues of the wheel, which strengthened the opinion that it had occurred in the state where the wheel was still celestial.
Mexican health insurance institution started a gene research that causes obesity
Health Insurance Institute is conducting research aimed at detecting gene responsible for the obesity of children and adults.
The Mexican Health Insurance Institute (IMSS) announced that a research aimed at detecting a gene that causes obesity in children and youths.
In the 21th century, Miguel ́z López explained that a multidisciplinary team was established from doctors, sisters, survival professionals and social workers.
This team is based on the support of post-gradual studies from the National Public Health Institute (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvesta) of the National Polytechnical Institute (IPN).
The research can also be connected to a broad public with or without permissions. People can come to sports with the IMSS sports centres in Valle de Mexico, where each group of 8 hours will conduct tests to youths.
He highlighted that the research started in the Sport Centre of Cuauhtémoc (Mexico State) and from 8 October, this activity was also carried out in the Sport Centre Nezahualcoyolt (Exode of Mexico).
When data will be obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the Sport Centre Independence (south from the Federal Idae) and finally in the Sport Centre Morelos (North of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to specify the components and significance of geneticity in the development of obesity, and to identify mexican children and young people's risk factors and thus predict chronic degenerative diseases.
At the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, celebrated on 14 November, he reminded that the purpose was to store data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with a consent and a supervision of parents, for specific questions on survival.
The questionnaire will also ask for physical activity and family anamnezis of heritage diseases to avoid risk factors that may cause disease such as sugar or renal failure.
He noted that every Sabbath with all antropometric measurements (weight, height, pass circuit), measures the blood pressure, determines the level of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, and tests genes (intendes to identify genes participating in child obesity).
López noted that this research reflects the anxiety of medical health over the alarming growth of child weight.
'The health cares carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that only in six years of age boys had increased by 77% and by 47% girls. The dramatic growth has also occurred in the case of overweight,' said the IMSS expert.
He noted that one of the points to look for indicators is the opinion that the country’s population is different from the final population of its genetic history.
He informed that the average Mexico has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in genes responsible for diabetes and overweight.
He explained that general obesity genetics are currently explained as an incapacity to spare the overland energy we consume (calorie) and which is stored in the form of tubes.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the employees is that they will receive a total assessment of the status of children, which will prove whether they show such known overweights or obsessions.
He noted that even the presence of the dark color inflammation (acantosis) on the neck and the preresolution indicates the probability that the unit will suffer with metabolic problems and pre-succertic conditions.
The information is still trustworthy, doctors give it to parents in writing and explain to them all the meaning and changes of life that they need to take to avoid disease.
López explained that there are three main ingredients that cause survival, obesity and other chronic diseases: a seat of life that means a lack of daily physical activity, a whole-day television seating and use of transport facilities rather than a short distance.
It also causes a big caloric income, which is a higher consumption of coated drinks, carbonhydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high range of tubes and proteins and a genetic burden that is subject to this research.
In Asfalt with UNAM
Rafael Herrera, dec from the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asfalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with a better quality, independent of climate and temperature
If it was properly concerned about the lack, it would not be necessary to carry out at least 200 thousand profits after each period of rain in Valle de Mexico, Rafael Herrera Najera, a chemical faculty (FQ) from UNAM, which added that if the asfalt deficiency was appropriate, it would have occurred to a significant limitation of the benefits, or it would even be possible to remove it completely.
In his preliminary Technology cause of the benefits he had made in the International Year of Chemie, he announced that the employee under his lead develops modified asfalts with polymers, which should result in a mix of similar characteristics as asfalt, but even more mechanical diligence, as well as at low and high temperatures.
Mr. Najera believes that this type of modified asfalts could be used in places with extremely heavy climate, such as in some cities north of the country. It would improve and reduce the creation of profits.
He explained that asfalt, the most difficult part of the rope, is the collection of the molecules of hydrocarbons, the molecule with a large molecular weight called asfalt, and other with the low molecular weight that is called maleten. Commonly adds asfalt typical viskoelastic character.
The vicoelastic character of asfalt results in that at high temperatures, approximately 180 degrees, it is treated as a liquid, at 120 degrees has a high vicocyte and at 50 degrees, however, in a strong state, while the asfalt has a low temperature trend to laugh.
This means that asfalt diligence in the streets is not unique, but has changed during the day according to orological submins and temperatures, the expert warned about chemical engineering.
A scientist from the Chemical Faculty noted that the streets in Ciudad de Mexico are covered by a flexible covering of six species of materials, of which three last are mixed with asfalt.
Among the highest levels there is a asfalt input, made by small stones in ashfalt and then in a stick.
He highlighted that every stone that makes an injection is to get asfalt.
When a car comes, or when the pressure is created, it is so possible that the powers in the pool are well distributed.
If it was a modified asfalt, it would be better distributed, the chemical engineer seems to be considered.
He added that on the asfalt layer, the last layer is called the layer made by a stone, thus the sand that is also cool in asfalt.
Since this layer will be attached to the contact with the vehicle, it must have more mechanical power than the asfalt entry and shall ensure the third vehicle.
As part of the burden is to be exposed to a large burden, it must have a sufficient packaging and must be taken into account the material from which it is prepared.
Climate, particularly walls and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that must be remembered, especially water has a great effect on the ability of asfalt input.
When the territory is low, the water is spread inside and it is hard to get out, it causes the mixture of all the layers of the wheat and the result of the profits.
He explained that during the creation of exhausts, the movie is first to hurt the flash and then comes to the damage of the asfalt input. It does not occur at a moment, but it is a permitted process that should be stopped with the first signs using the appropriate maintenance programmes.
As a member of the National System of Mediators, he also explained that the carriage is another important factor in the creation of profits, and therefore the carrier of each individual layer of departure must correspond to the load of the vehicle and must be assured that this burden is not exceeding. Only so we can prevent the frequent result of profits.
Rafael Herrera warned that we are still waiting for a job and research at the beginning. For example, asfalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries, are easily enabled to perform requirements without using high temperatures.
What happened to the Valle candidate to become a new Miss Columbia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna has not obtained the coronation of Miss Columbia.
Valle gets the 14th title of the first multimise.
Valle del Cauca hasn't reached the crown of Miss Columbie again.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the feeling of a victory, obtained a silver crown and a sharp, based on the new Columbia first maimiss.
Based on the results of the yesterday final in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico was winning and cheese, the department obtained the 14th title of the first multimis. Melina joined the representatives of women from Valle del Cauca, which were reached at the reach of the victory coronation, but were finally announced by the first additions. Among them belonged Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Others belonged to Miriam Ospina Benoit (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garces Aljure (2000 Girale Algeria) (2008 Girale Alpha).
The question that many people ask.
The fact is that the wound of the great favorite, which showed in all previous rounds that it was to become a new Miss Columbia, and not freely became the king's police and the most beautiful face of Joile de Volgue. These titles have been achieved, for example, Talian Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who had taken the title of Miss Kolumbie.
One of the key factors that decided that the portion had decided to name it only Private Multimiss is that she did not confess her answer to the question, "What book did you most like and why?", which Martin Murillo Gomez put in the literary text of Leamos.
The candidate answered:
"Please read, I believe in the role of the role, I think it's one of the forms of culture. The book that most affected me in childhood was the "Small Prince", a very deep book.
It is a book that is part of the worldwide, which everyone had to know. And today I have a book from Irene Nemirowski, Russian authors. It is a wonderful book called "El Ardor de la sangre".
However, this answer was not likely because of the term "culture" and secondly because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned were noted.
After the end of the celebration ceremonie, Melina declared that she was calm and she was glad of the outcome: "The world is wise what is going to happen.
And you people, you read, if you can.
One of the other hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
The Bogotic Journalist noted that the candidate was the most famous, unclean and the one who took all the prices previously (Gastronomic call Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic clothes and the Queen's mother), raised the dependence of the other attendants, stretched the queen, which then burned on the scene.
It was evident when the first presentation of the floor on the beach of Hilton and two overviews before the final crowning.
Even when she was on both July, it was known that she missed power and burning, which led representatives from Magdalene and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the "Aka home" program on the CNS Canal, believes that Melinda has received the title of the first multimiss confirms that the candidate who has received the most titles during the concurrence does not finally go with the coronation of the Queen."
Moreover, in the last days, Valle was more than an unfair statement to the media, and it wasn't payable for him.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the report on its social interests, which are based on the National Competition of Beauty.
On the other hand, two days before the election of the international member of Lucy Doughty reported that they are looking for a woman who will have the social needs of their country.
"In the competition Miss Columbia's beauty is missing, it is necessary to see something more than physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates have been involved in such projects before they enter into competition," she explained.
It also speculates that the candidate Valle has lost points because of the lack of her background and fibrosis that was on the back of the cup, but it is completely contrary to the verdict of the wedding, which has chosen her "natural beauty" for the most healthy body, the right survival and the responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing the Queen, recognizes that Melina had not the best body that there were the best girls here, "but the problems with fibrosis on the back, which, according to my opinion, was not too significant, have dressed points to the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos from the Cromos magazine believes that a parent from the Valle has made a mistake when she has reached a number of surgical steps.
"The chirurgical cases are all right, but they weren't in the Valle.
The body has never been her strong page and here has chosen her tax."
From this evaluation, which first had made the National Conservation of Beauty, after the overview of the vessels, came to the cruel prejudice that was fulfilled. It was said that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melina had to not finally have to give her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is certainly that Melina has started the year of her rulership today, not as a Queen, but as a princess, from the position that gives it the opportunity to represent Cookieia on various international competitions, where it will be appointed by the National Competition.
Nevertheless, it will be written into ≥in as one of the kings who, despite the successful success in Cartagena, did not get to the highest coronation.
That was the job of the inhabitants of Cali who identified the dead Alfonse Cana.
An expert on the printing of the fingers from Cali entered the story as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cana.
The work of these officers is key.
On November 4, the CTI fingerprint expert in Cali entered the history as a man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader Farc: "Alfonse Cana" and this by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts who work for the CTI division, this week was a series on Eliazar González, men from Puerto Tejada, who works 21 years in court research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at a council in Chocó, where he often had to look for more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the dead were necessary to identify.
In 2000, he moved to the main city of Valle, and then, after determining the relevant cubes, he started to specialize the printing of the fingers. This is a study of the third puzzle, so he cut his hands and his feet.
On the week when operations were conducted against Alfonse Cana, they told Eliazar to take clothes with him at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he went to Cauca in the Palmir's wheel.
He knew that he would have to identify two dead and that he was suspicious that one of them was a man who led the oldest guerill in the world, so they asked him to take a map with the printing of the fingers of Guillerm León Saenz (his right name).
However, when he came with an investigating team to the place where the dead was called, he didn't leave him from a physical excitement, but he seemed to be completely different than in the reporting events.
He didn't have you, he was dressed as a village in the Danemark, without a brilliant, much shielder.
But the prints don't want.
Along with the galton luxury, inquisitor and transplanter and light Eliazar began to compare the dactil records of the dead with the card records.
It was Alfonso Cano.
That same night the man from Puerto Tejada was approved that the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzon, confirmed whether the truth was the highest commander Farc.
Searching for tracks
For a dactiloscope from Siyan de Cali, the recognition shown to Eliazar González president Juan Manuel Santos on print operations of service against "Can" is very important.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is exact, without the possibility of a mistake that can play a key role in decisioning criminal acts.
Besides identifying the mortal, they help these people in investigating criminal acts such as stealing or murder and confirming the identity of captured persons.
When they are captured, a lot of delicts present false documents or have no papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator told that in the case of hurt, he had to remove the wall of the house in the house because he oppressed the evil place to get a treasure full of shoes and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to collect prints, but in this case we could get the printing of the whole hand and identify the pachat that had participated in some furniture," he reminded.
Fingerprints may also confirm or reject suspects in case of murder.
Recently, they found a dead man with a lack of alcohol around them.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for murder, and that the print on the lake was confirmed.
Although it cannot be gradually confirmed that he was a murderer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of crime.
The CTI fingerprint expert explained that the prints are "shooted by chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, the transplanter or the sand is used for their collection.
The prints are then sent to Asif, which is the delicts database, or to the Registration.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data are nowhere provided," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not all is as shown in the CSI TV.
Like all that is crazy, it's not gold, not everything you're touching remains.
However, if it can be used, appropriate comparisons must be carried out.
"Inflammation" protests in New York
Hundreds of demonstrants were pressed in Zuccotti, where they wanted to set up.
Most of them were waiting for the order of the space and moved to the nearby park.
The members of the movement Obseded Wall Street went out on Wednesday the representative of New York when they tried to get back to Manhattan, where they were carried out. Then they tried to take another non-Work park.
Hundreds of manifestants were pressed at Zuccotti, where they wanted to get through the court order that allows the "inflammated" to return to the place. The second part of the movement reacted to the dealing by taking a park north of the city, where there was another detention.
"When the court doesn't allow us to return to the place, we'll sit in another place and we'll continue in the legal battle with the goal of returning to Zuccotti, as well as the confusion of peaceful manifestations," said one of the speakers' movements "Let's sit Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray stated that the answer "inflammated" to the movement of the camp, which he himself commanded by the Officer of New York, Michael Bloomberg, was reached to the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued a command that prohibited the violent movement of the place and enabled demonstrants to continue to be set here.
Besides, they took another park located on the crossing of the Central Canal Street and the Sixte Avenue, near the entrance in the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the ground of the Fara in Trinity Church.
At least for a hour, they could take a place, but then the police came and stopped some manifestants.
The organization ensures that several hundreds of people have been sitting on the place, and the delegation of religious representatives has also come to support them and has also tried to negotiate with the police.
In addition to Zuccotti, which is a private property, it remains closed. It is expected a judicial proceeding to come rightly on Wednesday and the law of evacuation won't be analysed.
Some of the moved demonstrants even spread and distributed a copy of the judicial order and even gave them to those who were guarding the location, which caused the "small deteriorations", said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police manifestants were.
The Court order prohibits the authorities to move the members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or to use "the laws that have been published after the start of the ship, or to prohibit access to demonstrants to the park with trade or other places they used before."
The Starest Bloomberg noted for the print that, due to this court order, the city stopped the opening of the public space and the manifestants noticed that local laws did not allow them to return the events and packages.
The highest representative of the city protected personally the wounds of the movement in Zuccotti, the operation in which 200 people were arrested and accessed, because the manifestants were "building the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the site because it was "the place where people were not going to protest, but violate the laws and in some cases deteriorate, because " Some trades received dangerous letters" and "neighbors feared the quality of their lives".
"The early settlement was awesome and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests in the work of the American worker," added the speaker's movement that accused the anxiety that "they do not appreciate the freedom of expression".
The "Occupa Wall Street" movement representatives also stated that it was planning to organize "great action" on Thursday in cooperation with Communities and Communities to remember two months after which protests were held.
Pamela Anderson will represent Mrs. Marii in a special holiday TV order.
Along with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians will be found in the TV program "It's and" Peters Christmas on 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was a assistant Tima Allena in "Home Improvement", a shipmaster in "Baywatch", in "Playboy", a wife of Tommy Lee's annual musician, and now the cluster and model will be Lady Maria in a special holiday class of Canadian TV.
The CTV's private television station today announced that Anderson with the song of emotional songs Michael Bublé and other significant Canadians will find out in the TV program "It's and Peters Christmas" on the 1st, and he will forget Mrs. Maria.
The CTV today has shown records from the TV program, in which Anderson, also known from the Internet pornographic photos, will appear to her former husband, the engine "Möttley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as Mrs. Maria holding in the pools of the girl representing Jesus.
As Joseph on the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comic of Indian pump, who recently acted as a moderator on the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
Crome Anderson and Peters will find a Canadian song of Bublé in the special holiday CTV, who at the end of March march married in Buenos Aires with the argentin model Louisana Lopilato, and who is close to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Cardashian on one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after devastating landscape
HDP grows in 1.5% thanks to homelife and so ends the period of falls beginning in March
Since March of the year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now it is deteriorated from a devastated landscape that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country had to face from World War II.
By the review of the Tokyo government, material losses have been calculated for $30,000 million, which, despite the difficult worldwide divergence, are well different.
After three quarters of fall, the HDP value between July and September was in the position that it was possible to rotate the page with definitive validity: the HDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous fourth and by 6% annually.
The results of the second Thursday - for the Japanese tax year begins in March 2012 - also assume the largest growth time compared to ice to March 2010.
The survival may be partly explained by the purchase of machines necessary to restore devastated landscapes and subsequent tsunami.
Undertakings increased their investment by 1.1%, expenditure decreased by 0.9% over the ice period to March. It is the first decrease after six months of unexpected growth.
However, the real awakement of the Japanese economy comes exclusively from the impulse that needs to use the crisis to it, and it has been strengthened or renewed the infrastructure, which is to use the lack of it, and they have started completely from zero.
Japan was awakened, especially through the development of households, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese BDP.
This variable increased by 1%, increasing the costs of the vehicle, roads and free-time activity.
Yen Stigma
The currency of yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "saving values" for investments that flee from the low crisis from the euro and the anxiety predicts of the United States. It is a privilege, which is, however, a great burden for export companies.
With stronger currencies, products are more decent, which is negative for the country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony added their weak results in July to September just the yen course.
While markets continue to cover EU border countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda is careful.
"We have to take care of the risk that endures, such as the destruction of certain economics, the impact of the landscape in Thailand and the increase in yen," said the State Secretary for the Economic Policy of Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And the perspectives are not encouraged.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that the majority of the Member States had shown the signs of economic slowness in September.
The indicator, which predicts integrity in the world economy, showed that the economy of the main powers is slow.
She decreased by four decades to 100.4 points above 100.8 in August.
The euro has even been obtained under the average of the level 100. It has reached at level 99.13 points.
Atenas re-wide inconvenience
Papadimos says that they will be approved with susceptible measures, but the conservators will not sign any written commitment
Greece is still more involved in the labyrinth that leads to the outcome of a large debt crisis in Europe with the importance of employment and risk risk guarantees and the inefficiency it has re-controlled.
The view that the "contract" of the new transitional Greek Government is given more than the requests of Brussels than the real conviction of political forces, it begins to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Luke Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of 100 days that he received during his nomination would probably be short for their own, the president would conserve the Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said that the new susceptible measures would not support and repeat its request to repeat new elections on the proposed date of 19 February.
"The task of this Government is to apply the summit of 26 October," Papadimos declared yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will bring out tomorrow by voting on the trust of the government.
Package with 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officers and new measures against tax exclusion will be between the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samarase does not explain doubts about his position: "We have committed us to help the transitional government, but we have no longer committed anything else."
The President of the Conservatives went in his statement to the EU and the MMF a little far, and these organizations have to dislock 8 billion, which are at least at Athens, but he said that they would not support and sign any commitment on the implementation of susceptible measures.
The European Commission, which has already been distinguished by the impact caused by Papandre's referendum games, stressed yesterday that its requests are incomplete: it does not dislock any help if the new government and representatives of the main parties do not sign "the written commitment without double-being and what may be first".
The speaker for the Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that inspectors from Troyka will return "very quickly" to Athen and will act with the new government about "what's to pay the sixth part" 8 billion. Definition of the date but does not exist.
The Greek girl's still wanted to get out of what.
Queen Sofie: "There are tools for progress and on"
The Kingdom shall highlight the primary position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has reached a significant position at the world level in relation to microfinancing".
Queen Sofie yesterday reminded that the country has become a second gift of the planet in the last two decades, regarding this tool of cooperation, which is based on "the tool of social progress, justice and the better future for the whole of mankind. It is a tool based on human trust".
The Queen yesterday started the 5th worldly sum of the micro-power in Valladolide with the conviction that "not doubt" that this type of operation "is absolutely necessary" for it, and that they reached the Millennium Targets established by the United Nations until 2015. "It is especially about the completion of the objectives that have to achieve a decrease of the half of people living with less than one dollar per day, so with the amount fixed by poverty."
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsiblely", emphasized Queen Sofia, who hopes that initiatives and benefits of Summitus, which needs to be until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacity and opportunities for those worse and especially for women", which are designed primarily for these loans.
"We have reached a lot" and "Multiful calls are still before us."
The summary of micro-limits must be not only a debate forum but also a platform that will support the "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the goal was that 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services until the end of 2015 and that 100 million families would be over the poor poverty in which they are currently living.
The concept of micro-licenses spread to Spain and to other countries of the world after "what was issued on this road by the Muhammad Yunus idea," the Queen said and added that it was "the act of justice and the needed recognition".
The father of this tool described as a "wonderful idealist who had seen the way to fight poverty." She met his work 15 years ago, when she was released to Bangladesh to meet directly in his policy of loans.
After this experience, further followed. The world summit in Washington and other meetings, for example, in the Slovenia Bridge in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I could find an inconsistent development, the Queen explained the title of "the head of the family", which she had given in Valladolid, the "being of the poor".
The Queen of Sofia revoked her exhibition by calling for the employees to participate in discussions and search for solutions and thus enabled them to continue fighting poverty.
"Ethical Emperative"
The Ministry of Zambia, Trinidad Jiménez, announced that the solidarity "is ethical emperative" must be managed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with ballohobit, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that micro-powers represent "serious and honest policy to remove poverty" and now more than ever before the governments of developed countries have to work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to become victims of grapes.
For Spain, a microcommerce is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secrets for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on our confidence to people who are all closed by the door.
The CDU aims to choose the European President on the basis of the general election right
Without serious pressures for the Office and the President of the Christian Democratic Party, Angel Merkel passed on Monday 14 November, in Lipse, the first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The question of the future of Europe was not on the plan p, but it has become up to the top, in particular to be satisfied by the members of the parties who consider the government policy today against the Greeks and may be tomorrow to the Italian for lax.
On behalf of the President of the European Commission, the leadership given by the European Commission was to be adopted at the same time.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were opposed, and 10 delegates remained voting.
Several minutes of sheep come to the conclusion of the exhibition of Angely Merkel and after a few hours after Wolfgang Schäubla, a very pro-European Minister of Finance, did not leave a place for doubts.
The vote of the Officer's idea and the responsibility to the crisis "not less of Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "9 million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Office in Europe, "the time has been changed."
This could be expressed by changes in Lisbon with a view to strengthening the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the euro Member States, but it could also take place in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of the general electional rights "to give Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the convention accepted, whose inspirator is Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly only a little likely that all twenty-seven countries will agree on this revolutionary step: contrary to British and the leading representatives of the CDU think that we will also take the same position to Nicolas Sarkozy.
But the direction's exhausted.
Similarly, delegates refused to evaluate the weight of each country in the representation of the European Central Bank depending on its economic weight, which is evidently involved in strengthening German weight.
In the past, the Office has made a number of references to the Conrad Adenauer and Helmuta Kohla, but it has not tried to get a congress speaking about the "small" European States or the States in the pressures that are willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If we are concerned about Europe, one paragraph refers to the importance of the "France-German Friendship", Angela Merkel France did not.
Just not right.
When she recalled that just two years ago, the blood battle was running in Lipse.
It was one of the most humiliating wounds of the Napoleon Army.
What is the subject of incapacity’s work?
After support, the UMP and the government official against labour incapacity are launched.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Wednesday 15th in Bordeaux and will visit the Agency for Social Aid, where it speaks of a topic repeated from 2007 on the fight against social undergoing and the redistribution of solidarity.
As a result of this official, which comes from the will of encouraging support in the context of increased tenderity, but not less in view of the right presidential campaign, the right to concentrate on the work of incapacity.
Firstly, because of the budgetary efforts, the Government intends to introduce the work of the private sector on the fourth day of incapacity before they continue to support the disease.
Clearly, without a consent of the company, the employee who is sick would lose four days of salary, so at least 15% of his monthly revenue.
The care that risks to cause a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the letter Les Echos, could bring 280 million euros.
In addition, measures to be taken by further symbolic achievement measures: giving public employees an unlimited work on one day (not yet incapacity to exceed three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of the debate, the right will also start the subject of the undercuts this time related to crimes related to work incapacities.
"The controls will be much more comprehensive and more: if you'll be attempted, you'll return," Xavier Bertrand warned on the conversation of the RTL station on Sunday 13 November.
Similarly, as in other cases, the effects of the notice appear to be inappropriate in view of the truth of injustices in unemployment.
These were the subject of continuous monitoring since 2002 and the political efforts that brought their fruits.
The French are not more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's first stop with some official numbers.
According to Caisse national d'assurance disease (CNAM - State health insurance) in 2006, more than 237 million euros of daily refunds were paid.
According to the French Constitution for Research and Health Documentation, in 2008 the daily refunds were represented by EUR 11,3 billion.
46% of this amount were related to maternal contributions and job contributions and 54% were related to unemployment incapacities, e.g. 6,2 billion euros.
So only 2.5% of health costs.
According to the study of the Alma Consulting Group, France in 2010 had about 14,5 days of work incapacity for 17,8 days in 2009.
The average that hids certain derogations in itself: another survey published in 2007 on the sites of murderers with the opportunities of Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 questioned French employees answered that they had not chosen any day of uncapability.
Other studies, conducted this time by the disease insurance institutions, state that in 2010 37.8% of work uncapabilities were shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% was longer.
When we compare them to their European neighbors, the French employees are no more than to the worklessness otherwise.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that the total absency (from health deficiencies or none) in France was estimated between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 18% in the Netherlands.
In the case of work incapacities, only a very small part of work on the black is a higher part of work.
It's about the fools, these are just a small range.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 caused systematic controls to work longer than 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM noted that at 1.5 million controls, 13.8% of 285.000 were carried out due to a short-sufficient "injustified or too long" incapacity, i.e. 37.050 cases.
In the case of systematic controlled incapacities of more than 45 days, 11% of the cases of "non-adaptated or unadjusted" were calculated to 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
Thus, in total, 169 000 "injustified" cases for a number of million employees who had an incapacity.
A number that represents much less than the number of work on black.
According to UMP Dominique Tiana, the author of the June Report on this question, this number would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing tax election per year, which is more than the total amount of daily refunds and, therefore, unfortunately more than the dumbs associated with the last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new salvation plan
Greece will need a new salvation programme to restore its economy.
On Monday 14, the President of Minister Lucas Papademos presented these words before Parliament and added that hundred days given to his government of units are sufficient to fulfil this task.
"To that, and again, we have put our economy on our feet, we support our European partners and a new budgetary budget plan," the Government's boss declared when he found his first public statement in the middle of the beginning of the debate to vote on trust in Parliament.
The application of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the sum of the euro will be added to the new government's task, since our country is in the game in euro.
Following that, Mr. Papademos assumed that the public deficit of the country would be from now to the end of the year "approximately 9%" of the gross domestic product after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights reject new susceptible measures
The Leader of the Right of Antonis Samaras expressed its support on Monday with a already approved measure to try to avoid debt crisis, but noted that his party was not committed to any additional susceptible measures.
"We will not take a hand for any new measures," Samaras emphasized to meet the lawyers for the New Democracy.
We agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt and fighting the defence, but we are against any policy that would protect economic relief.
Mr. Rehn, European Economic and Monetary Commissioner, who warned that MMF and the EU do not disbloke the necessary debt of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee of all parties supporting the proposed measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that they would not sign anything under the external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize eutanase and assisted suicide, says the Commission of Experts
According to the report of the King-Kanada Society, the Canadians are dead.
In the case of the Commission's paliative care, it is urgent that governments, health careing institutions and physicians work with the aim of ensuring the best paliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian company lives with a idea of death.
Only 9% of the Canadians accept the opportunity to talk to your doctor about the subjects in which they want to die, and he takes the decision in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the general report of the Royal Canadian Society, in which six experts worked in different areas, including ethics, rights and medicals.
This Commission recommends to the Government to amend criminal rights in order to allow assisted suicide and eutanase if this option appears to be necessary for the patient considered competent to take such decision.
At the beginning, experts have recently listed an independent agency Economyst Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Maybe Canada was located on the 10th place, the study notes that "the Medicalisation of the Death in Canada has brought forth a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medicalisation yes or not, 77% of the Canadians have no access to paliative care, experts communicate us with the mandate of the King's Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die in the house of Canadians, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to the whole Canada, while in Quebec province this number is higher than 86% of the dead in the hospital.
This is a delicate issue of eutanase and assisted suicide, the reporters are influenced by the conclusions against the position of the Federal Government, which already said that the criminal law on eutanase and assisted suicide would not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also undergone controls of all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered criminal cases, there is no evidence that this criminalisation causes a serious misuse in the practice of eutanasis or an assisted suicide to persons incompatible or incompatible.
Instead, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, together with the reports, confirmed in the television yesterday more than the fair cases of these exhibitions just in countries where eutanase and sustained suicide are not legalized.
"Eutanasis is also conducted in Canada, where it is essentially illegal."
"Assistent suicide is also conducted in Canada, where it is essentially illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are clowned by eutanasia
Remember that, according to the investigation of the Forum of Reid in 2010, 85% of the Canadians have already expressed the benefits of eutanase because they do not allow people to facilitate their suffering at the end of life.
And 66% does not mean that legalization of eutanase means that we send a message that the life of older or handicapped persons has a less price.
41% of the questioned persons judge that they should not be judged.
In the matter of maintenance or interruption of the patient's care is less, reporters say.
In the list of their recommendations, it is also suggested that the derogation from the treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not penalty.
The Commission also requires experts to be trained by doctors to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of life without fear of penalty.
In the case of the Commission's paliative care, it is urgent that governments, health careing institutions and physicians work with the aim of ensuring the best paliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of a paliative or final distress already used in the Canadian health equipment, the Commission requires that it be considered to be no longer used to reduce physical disease, eutanase, and to support the same procedures.
Refunds of the final experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their exemptions regarding the conclusions of the reports of experts of the Canadian Society.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a medical specialist, was guarding the position of experts-signers of the report as "external" otherwise because he does not limit the practice of eutanase to the sick in the final phase.
"This opens the door to the deal, when everyone who was awakened with life and who had been more than 18 years could ask him to help him relax himself," says Pierre Deschamps, who simplified the summary of messages yesterday.
P. Deschamps also stresses that it seems to be the authors of the reports to autonomy of the person over all the final values that create a social prejudice company.
Because "in the company, it says, there are warning marks and restrictions."
Margaret Somerville's medical rights specialist also designed "fortunate meetings to the conclusions of the report that she was "manifest for eutanase".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Kingdom Society of Canada, is particularly doubting the data of the report on the absency of doubts in some countries where eutanase and aid suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the United States of Oregon.
The Jordan King invites President Assada to reject
The lady's talking about "complot"
Syria is more isolated
Bashara al-Assada stoups showed yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressures were intensified on Syria, president Bashara al-Assada, who is distorting them with Russia's support and talking about "complot" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of the Syrian membership in Lisa of Arab States, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the Neighbourhood of Syria, revealed the position in the benefits of the department of President Assada.
The Jordan King Abdallah II was the first ruler of the Arab State yesterday, who called President Bashara al-Assada to kill nearly 40 civilians and members of the military forces of the regime.
"If Bašar had the interests of his country, he had to give a demise, but he had to also create submines necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, the country of neighbourhood with Syria, at the BBC station interview.
At its side, the Turkish diplomatic leader Ahmet Davutoglu policyed that the efforts of the Turkish relief in Syrian regime from the beginning of the year were not successfully corroborated.
"They who don't live on the Middle East in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them will go" he announced with an injury to the neighborhood of Syria, which Turkey applies to what more stronger line.
The United States were pleased with "the strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the unrespectable deal of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the Arab States and of the European Union.
"The International Community, the United States, the European Union, the Liga of Arab States, the country as Turkey applying the more stronger tone" against the repression in Syria, Mark Toner, the speaker of the Ministry of Affairs.
As the Syrian observer for Human Rights announced, during this time, there were 16 civilians in the city of Dera in the south of Syria and 19 members of the prosecutive forces.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians have been destroyed in the city of Jobar in Homos.
However, during the printing of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Mouall considered that the country was "coming out of the crisis".
Recently, he lived to the decision of the Arab States to stop Damascus' membership, which represents a dangerous step.
Syria doesn't decline,'added with the sure that "the complots committed against Syria did not succeed."
After his decision to stop Syria, the membership is currently thinking of the "mechanism of protection of civilians" Liga of the Arab States and intends to send 500 human rights protectors, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Alain Juppé is also favorably emphasised to send the United Nations observators to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which is "paranoid" according to.
The new special meeting of Ligy is invited to Rabata to review the plan for the resolution of the crisis, which was decided on 2.
The Russian Minister Sergei Lavrov considered that the Liga of Arab States was "building" yesterday while China urged Syria to adopt a crisis-resolution plan, but the support of casual sanctions against Damascus was completely excluded.
Italy
Monti requires time and sacrifices in Italy
The next leader of the Italian Government Mario Monti requested the markets for a little time to be able to form its team and to start implementing a program that will include "offers" to get the confidence lost in the past months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed the political parties yesterday before meeting with the representatives of staff and employees today.
It should consist of a relatively shadow cabinet consisting of technocrates that are not part of the parliamentary parties.
"Monti has spoken of the important programme with many victims," Francesco Nucara, a lawyer of one of the members of the parliamentary groups of discussions after meeting the designated Ministerial Chairman.
The President of the Missionary Chairman Gianfranco Fini expects that Mario Monti asks Parliament to express confidence to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
It will end with Mario Monti by representing the small team of the twelve ministers of President Giorgi Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented on nervousness on financial markets yesterday and asked them for time.
In "democracy, it applies exact terms" about the preparation of the government and its program, he highlighted and added that it is "certain that markets will be patient and understandable".
His name by the President was initially accepted favorably, but the concern was renewed after an unexpected serial fall of the industrial production in the euro.
The named Minister should be a team which includes mainly technology, even if he underlined that he would adopt the "policy".
He expressed the conviction that the new government will maintain until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to the President of the Missionary Chamber Gianfranca Fini, the new government will receive the trust of Parliament to Friday.
Mario Monti has promised to act with an extraordinary interest and to become Italy again a strong article of Europe.
The speaker of the European Commissioner of Rehna stressed that "and with the new government, our Italian economic diagnosis has not changed."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the sustainable plans adopted in the past months, Rome will not reach its goal that is equivalent to the budget in 2013, and requires new strong measures.
Confindustria Emma Marcegagli, who is meeting with Montim on Wednesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "for the country that does not show growth cannot comply with deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for its professional knowledge and independence, "profesor" symbolized by the authors of the leaders "the challenge to seriousness" and "other Italia", represents "epochical change" for Italy after 17 years "berlusconism".
The time of life of his team will be very unknown.
President Napolitano would have acquired preliminary elections, since Italy has to place state debts for EUR 200 billion until April 2012.
The Soviet Dec assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
The Soviet Decec Viczeslav Danilenko helped Iran to develop a detonator useful for atomic weapons, reported on Wednesday the American non-governmental organization specialized for atomic risk.
The Institute for Atomic Energy and International Security (ISIS) shall be based on a recent report from the International Agency for Atomic Energy (MAAE) and other unique documents from this UN Agency.
Last week, MAAE reported her "serious concern" about the "potential military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS institution, the width of the MAAE documents, V. Danilenko (No. 1934) should work three decades of the sixty years in the Soviet military research center in Čeljabinsk (Ural), where the production of synthetic diamants should be used by the explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991, he had to leave the center to establish an "nano-diamanty" company in China.
The economic challenges of his company were to bring him to contact the Iranian Majesty in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he had to cooperate in the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In his last report, MAAE has clear information about the development of a detailed system conducted by Iran "from the work of a foreign specialist who did not only know this method but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked during a large part of his career work on this Property in the military nuclear programme of the country from which it comes."
Anti-muslim criminal acts and delicies were decreased by 50%
According to the FBI published on Monday, the number of crimes and delicts against the Muslims has increased with 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time the remaining racial and religious violence has slowly decreased or a little.
According to these numbers, the total number of violence involving the Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is 49% of increase in 13% in violence against Catholics, decreased by 4% in Jews and the total growth of 14% in anti-governmental crimes and delicities.
The total number of "defence criminal acts" was very easier to 6.628 cases, from which 47.3% were reasoned by the FBI's racial differences and 20% of religious differences.
"After the vacation in 2009, it is disappointing to see these criminal acts and crimes again," emphasized the Human Rights First, "the growth of anti-muslim violence is particularly significant," added the organization in its communication.
"Human Rights First stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hateful crimes, must be considered as a serious human rights violation," adds one of the leading factors of the organization of Paul Legendre.
"American Government can and must do more to cope with these crimes," he adds and considers that this could continue to improve the police report on "hate crimes".
"The hatred criminal action" in the American federal law is the inheritance of the time of fighting for civil rights.
This legal rule was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to maintain violence associated with race, color of floor, religiousness, pâ and now and sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and likes more Facebook
The Twitter microblog service provider page made changes in design on Monday to enable her owners to observe the activity of followers, which sometimes compares her Facebook services.
New "activity" and "name" offers better and directly know the activities of other persons who follow you or persons whose responses ("tweets") you follow.
This allows whether they can monitor the contributions, whether they are notified to new parties, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested in August on a small percentage of people before it was extended in the entire network on Monday, AFP said to the Twitter Carolyn Penner speaker.
Twitter, known by his little instinct function, with terms sometimes incomprehensible (RT for repeated extension of the contribution of someone else, followfriday for recommender de suvre un other user) makeing le bonheur des initiés, with opening a public plus large with a manement plus comparable and the des networks great public Facebook and Google+.
On the network, people immediately consider the importance of this innovation in their "tweets".
"It's unusual, it takes many places and it's too like Facebook," writes @imb123.
"Function The Activity will help me to follow some of my Twitter elements," he sent @dannykronstrom.
Croatia
inscription of the golden rules on the balanced budget in the constitution
The Government of a large coalition of social democracy and Christian democracy, which is in Russia, decided on Wednesday to write the "oral rules" budgetary policy to the constitution to reduce the public deficit and to avoid such a possible reduction of the rating agencies (AAA).
It was the social-democracy officer Werner Faymann who reported this decision to the conclusion of the Council of Ministers when the Russian public debt is 74.6% higher than the maximum of 60% of the Maastricht Agreement, but much less than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Russia's solvency was decreased by only one degree from AAA to AA+, they had to pay at rates every year for three billion euros more," argumented the major officer and minister of the Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Croatia thus refers to the request of the sum of the euro country held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the heads of the States and the Governments are highly requested to reduce public deficit and to achieve public equality until the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the cancer government is close to the "German Model", Germany was the first European country that adopted such "regulation".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (HDP) each year and start in 2017 the public structural deficit of the Federal State shall be decreased by 0.35% of the HDP each year, while the lands and the foreign countries will have to demonstrate a balanced budget.
The objective is to obtain public debt at the 2020/21 horizon under the 60% criteria established by Maastrichts with

Node threatens a new intervention on device markets
The Japanese Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Wednesday that Japanese institutions would have to reintegrate on the devise markets if they should only continue in strengthening.
"We understand how we've done this, if we're too disaster," in the changed yen course, he explained the senate Y. Nod.
On Wednesday, it was only to the historical values offered by the Japanese authorities on 31 October to intervene.
On that day, Tokio sold the yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which recently overcome the record against the dollar valid since 1945.
But only since that time, it has been regularly supported by the purchases of investors who consider it a "safe presence" in the disasters of the world's economic delay and the European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar returned under 77 January and the euro fell under the symbolic rate of 105 January to the nearby level of the last intervention.
Before financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar had a value of about 120 January and more than 160 January.
This planning of Japan’s currency harms the export island because it deductes the price of Made in Japan and reduces the value of the costs obtained by the Japanese foreign companies when they are transferred into domestic currency.
"Japan is rejected" from the torture caused by March's landing and the tsunamis of the region of Tohoku at the north-east of the country, Y. Nod, who fears that this training is not yet killed in the sheep of cruel life.
The third world's economic power renewed growth in the third quarter of the year (1.5% as regards the previous quarter) and this first in one year, thanks to the growth of exports and the needs of domestic disasters.
But the Minister said that the high value of yen was nerelected by the "National Economy of Japan".
The Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi invited the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which started at Friday two-day meeting, to take all possible measures leading to weakness.
But the major government of this institution Hirohide Yamaguči noted that the BoJ had already adopted "adequate measures" before indicating that no additional monetary weakness could be expected in the middle of the center.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the cost paper establishment increased by 5.000 billion in January (47 billion euros) and increased by 55 billion billion in January (519 billion euros) a range of amounts for the purchases of different valuable papers for the purpose of shipment with liquidities.
Euro:
the taxes stand, the birds fail.
The risk of debt crisis is still underground by European indicators.
Despite the nomination of new government leaders in Greece and Italy and the better numbers of growth in France and Germany, the taxes of weak countries continue to grow.
Europe's birds are still concerned about the euro stability today on Wednesday 15 November.
In Paris in 10 hours CAC index 40 lost 1.4% at 3.064 points.
Dax index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"Continuing with new pressures about the income of the euro state loans, the markets with shares worldwide are only part of recent profits."
"Neurological investors only recognize the risk of disappointment," explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets, quoted by Re日s.
Burza in Tokyo concluded with a decrease of 0.7%, which suffered because of the threats of the market in Europe's capacity to cope with a debt crisis.
"Japan as the rest of the world has eyes on Europe, and the change will only continue in a hard way of variation until investors have evidence that the stability is stabilised," recalls Mitsušige Akino, the fund manager of Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This restart of the uncertainty of the future of the euro is damaging the self-money that continues in its decrease on Wednesday.
The euro is reached at the lowest level since a month and a half.
In 10 hours, the European currency is 1.3570 dollars at 0.4%.
According to the currency officers, the Party of the Office of Angely Merkel at its conference adopted the possibility of providing out of the euro for countries experienced in pressure on Monday, unless they had to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far away for 6%
The taxes for loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying height.
Today, at Tuesday, the price of the Italian decade obligations is 6.85% and the amount of Spanish decade obligations is 6.2%.
This pressure affects the rates of South-European countries, but also in France continues to strengthen market fears.
The future leader of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, requested highly time on the markets to be able to endanger the threatened debt in Italy by the height of its debt.
The new Greek Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the application of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the summit of the euro will be "loyal task" of his government.
Spain is once again located in the intentional market rights when they make elections in the land on Sunday.
The rate (pread) division between the decades of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
In the expectation of numbers of indicating euro growth
The statistical numbers say that France mentioned the economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter of the households, which caused primarily the need for household, a little better than the expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Affairs and Economic Study INSEE reviewed the direction of the numbers below for the second quarter of the decrease of 0.1% of the BDP instead of stagnation.
And it's the fourth quarter that the economy's most worrying.
During the same period, Germany registered an increase of 0.5%.
The European Commission has just warned about the risk of a new recess.
Energy policy:
facts have to win over dogmates
If there are some topics that cannot be understood on the basis of short developments or emotions, it is energy policy.
Availability and electricity prices have direct impact on purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is natural that the meeting at elections is an opportunity to think about such inputs and the location that takes energy from the nuclear.
The debate will be successful only when all economic, social and environmental impacts are examined on the options.
The French must establish their position on objective and rational data.
Still, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but the demographic development will lead from 2050 to double electrical requests, if we want a significant part of the world population to save the important part of life.
At the same time, it will be necessary to deal with the lack of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity, and it can not be forgotten the need to reduce the needed gases caused by a steel effect in order to fight climate changes, which is the subject that is currently mixing from the environmental debates.
The accident in Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains only in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
However, this is not a case that undermines its decision of need for a different source of replacement by himself, nor Switzerland, which considers the right construction of only the electrical last generation.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, and at least some countries, continue to decide in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to extend their park to one unit by rebuilding the building of one electricity interrupted after the Tree Mile Island.
If a German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, the reality resists it.
The Berlin election is shown by the delivery of the electricity price, increased by the energy dependence on gas imported particularly from Russia, by the increase in CO2 by the land gas and carbon exhibition.
All these inappropriates we're feeling for a few months.
The case of Danish deserves, and they thought about it.
The European champion in electrical electricity, from which 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest carbon and gas consumers, so that the CO2 and the Danish electricity prices are higher than 65%, and 50% of the European average.
On the contrary, our energy policy will pay our neighbor's facture for electricity by 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in the globalized energy economy the costs are the key factor of competitiveness and the guarantee of the deterioration of the industry in the national territory, the French undertakings consume the benefits of the latinest electricity in Europe.
From this point, every significant reduction in nuclear energy share would result in a strong increase in electricity price, which would make an illustrative beautiful declaration of the renewable industrialisation of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
The price that the large majority of Frances refuses to pay, as is generally contrary to this energy as shown by public opinions.
Remember that our country's energy policy has enabled the sector to set up 125,000 direct jobs and 41,000 employees.
The exporting sector is strongly drawing to the international markets a large amount of small and medium-specialized enterprises creating a job that cannot be transferred into a farmer.
If France decided to leave the nuclear, it would offer a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would come to 6 billion euros per year, which the country obtains for the export of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrical owner would deal with the nuclear reaction proposed to work 60 years while the incidence of his manufacturer was planned?
When solving energy equation, it is necessary to admit that there is no cool source for energy production, so that there is no devil.
The volume of low CO2 manufacturing equipment and equipment uses renewable energy resources carried out by the French industrial group AREVA witnesses the complementarity of energy resources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have the State Agency for Nuclear Safety, which conducts an uncompromised and transparent supervision of existing nuclear electricity as well as the building of a new electricity in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionality is recognised have a thought of security in blood.
In fifty years, he met the nuclear industry with three serious hawairs.
The only one in Three Mile Island was under normal operation and remained without human victims and experiences for life.
The drama in Blacknobyl caused the concepts of a reaction and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some believe that the havary was a survey of two natural disasters that caused decades of thousands of people to die.
The nuclear industry will take a lesson from this holiday as he did in the past two.
The fruits of this step and cooperation between the French and German authorities with nuclear security, operators and Property are that the EPR reacter represents the concept to be able to cope with such vessels.
While all interested people who want to build a nuclear electricity, they consider it, the suspension of its exhibition in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to AREVA and EDF group competitors and the release of the road to strengthen the leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best solution to energy for our country, but it would be unresponsibility to allow emotions, dogmates and machines to control the debate that is so determining for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is it for the economic immigration of charges or chances?
The immigration in Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from different angles - the payment of the police, courts and administrative policies, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "the country of human rights", which France praises.
Recently, it was administration of the burden which was the object of the students of the province, which became current when the Ministry of the Inside (see the magazine of Libération of 23 May) declared that France "not foreign talents, walls and servants".
But yet only a few times has been divorced under the economy.
It is necessary to say that in this respect, it applies to a pretty wide match between the left and the right.
Tone right in 1976 Jacques Chirac made his statement that "900000 unemployed people should not be a problem in the country where 2 million immigrant workers are charged" and at the left of Michael Rocard, when he said that in 1990 France could not accept the world's distress."
The only difference is the degree of magnitude
In 2005, fear of the invasion of Polish installers in the French territory was divided and left.
In both camps, immigrants are considered a burden for economic and French company.
The only range remains in the degree of greatness that we will return to immigrants to offer.
François Holland is limited to banalities in its programme when it suggests that the common development will allow us to resolve our "immigration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be applied in choices, but economically, it is very dear.
How the economics Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in their recently published part of the most recent invasive knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shape Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton & Press, page 352): among specialists there is a wide consensus on the position of impact movements on economic growth, sales and employment in countries that immigrants accept.
Limitation of immigration protects growth and damage of employment.
The fears of the effects caused by the people are based on the idea that these people can replace French works, especially those less affected, and make pressure to reduce their limits.
However, experience shows that immigrants are much more complementary than replacements for French employees by performing jobs in sectors with lack of employees.
A few immigrants in sectors that do not include French employees, and most of them in dynamic sectors in which the education offers places.
Positive effects on the sales
Like the chirurg will have an effort to work in the country where anestesiologists are lacking, this supplement between France and the employees causes immigrant income to affect the sales and the employment of the French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that growing movements of 1% would result in an increase in real limits between 0.6 and 0.9%.
Instead, it does not take into account that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of thoughts and economic growth (height part of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also pure social systems contributors in European countries directly at 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Work Organization considers that in Germany one immigrant will bring its entire life to public budgets a net contribution (income minus expenditure) EUR 150000.
Nicolas Sarkozy said at the beginning of his mandate to reach the missing percentage of growth with estimated teeth."
The tents used to deal with immigrants had just a negative effect.
Europe has found democracy, remains thinking of the European Democracy
Democracy is rare and very nice goods.
The European continent should remember that, although he had invented it in Athens two thousand years ago, he lived in the tragedy of world wars, totality regimes, holocaust, gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazara in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
Some people could believe that to make democracy definitively triumph over their enemies, it would be enough to make a choice and make it the best way.
However, Napoleon knows that it was easy to think.
The general election right, whether the democracy is needed, is not sufficient and can be a "treatment tool", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, the democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, division and control organisation, education, accuracy, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we experience is a economic crisis, but it is just as from the beginning of political and democracy crisis.
The recognition of a Greek reference type of yes will not have the value of double discovery in this direction: discovering the need for a great return of political power, but also discovering anxious feeling of his incapacity, his inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought to be convinced.
The truth is that the front lines of democracy have been moved today and that many of the Republican battles have no longer shot in the right direction.
We can't get anything if we will require a number of national references organized according to needs and disorganized.
Bianko exposed to the European absolutist monarch or a hopp with the feet connected to a empty nationalist depth: what choice for citizens!
No, we don't want the legs of gilotine, but the common, full, peaceful and continuous choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor did they finally know where to stop - because the crisis is in Europe.
This is the same thing that the whole Europe is dealing with the dictate of markets and rating agencies that suffers from its incapacity and the lack of solidarity.
This is the same thing in the whole Europe, which is humiliated at the international scene.
We are disappointed by transfering the sovereignty to Europe, but this is the whole Europe who will slowly lose its sovereignty and everyone of its nations with it.
Increasingly, the management of the European draft democratic sovereignty is needed.
Because only the Europeans will be able together to reduce their debts' burden, to avoid the market governments and to prepare the future.
The outcome of the crisis will assume a decision at a European level that will be able to be taken without a complete democracy legitimity, elsewhere, it would lead us to the grave.
After we have struck against this socialist and Jacquese Delors, all today are highly demanding the European Economic Government.
Wake up.
But thinking of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and enjoyed as citizens, would be a new foolishness and a new blind street.
We must take a new stage of European building.
In order to develop the Republic in France, it must be "republicated".
Revolution in interests couldn't be enough for it.
This lesson continues to be applied.
We have to build Europe, which will be more economically integrated.
This will only be able to make Europe more political and true European democratic superiority.
Let's become Europeans, and they built Europe.
"Uncontact" chip cards are width
In the optimistic atmosphere, it will be opened on Wednesday in Villepinte near Paris the world of chip cards.
Eurosmart, according to the cabinet, should end by increased world sale card with a microprocessor (bank cards, SIM card phones) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most wearing is the uncontact segment, which allows the payment in a home transport or the purchase of purchases only by enlarging the card to the reader.
This year should be sold throughout the world 460 million chip cards against 320 million sold for a year ago!
Their shares should remain in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total market with chip cards (6.925 million cards).
After it was in the country of APEC, Europe gets an area in an uncontact payment.
Approximately 26 million bank cards of Visa are already equipped with this and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the beginning is more humiliated: 400,000 uncontact cards were issued in Visa.
But big business strings work for two.
Carrefour delivered 2,5 million uncontakt cards Pass MasterCard this year.
And they have arranged a higher degree, it's necessary that their clients be equipped from now on.
"The two large French companies have committed to distribute systematic distribution in the future to their clients of a cardless bank," Gérard Nébouy, Director-General Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile
But this is just the first step for the payment of the future: a mobile phone.
The NFC technology (Near Field Communication) that is necessary to perform transactions is now only a small number of devices.
"They've got late."
"But their real dimension should come in the next year."
"For 2012, we consider their sales to 80 to 120 million units in the world," explains Marc Bertin, President Eurosmart.
But the banks are already ready forward.
Bank Crédit Agriculture announced yesterday the launch of the test conducted in Caen, which takes the duration from the end to June next year.
Approximately 200 clients and co-operation of iPhone devices will be equipped by the allowing uncontact payments.
The BPCE Bank has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Society General also announced yesterday that she was preparing for a offer that allows her clients to pay a mobile phone without touch.
The terrorist front of Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is anxious between Al-Kajdo in the Islamic Maghreb and the Sect Boko Haram.
Long-term suspicion that there are associations with the terrorist group of Al-Kajda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Minister's office for Abdelkader Mesahel even admitted that Algier's been aware of it since now.
"The way both organizations operate, and the reports of scientist services show that there is a large cooperation between them," he explained without further claim.
Paris seems to have similar analysis.
In January 2010, two Franceses' contributions in Nigeria could be helped to clarify the connective staff.
After taking AQMI members from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Del’s next day should have been killed at the same time as some of their assets during the operation conducted by special French units.
The French and Nigerian investigators had found several phones with the chips of terrorists.
Ocean Territory
Analysis of performed calls leads to a number of people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to the radio France Internationale (RFI) station, researchers are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to Nigeria, which has long lived in Maiduguri, a city northern Nigeria, which is the Boko Haram colleague, and another to a person who is told that he is close to AQMI and sect.
"It's a progress, but it's absolutely necessary to wait for more convinced evidence before we start talking about AQMI and Boko Haram operations."
"But you're possible."
"We already know that it enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is more active," the peaceful Nigerian investigator of Kunle Amuwo.
In the past months, this "support" was more and more evident in the development and demonstrations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which currently include human victims or even more complex explosive equipment in the same way of implementing the AQMI organizations.
The international community has since developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems that Boko Haram has raised.
The Nigerian authorities in Andastia considered the group a little valuable interest as a community of mysticals.
Quick Success
See Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mixture, schools and fundamentalists of Mohammeda Yusufa. Boko Haram, which in the language of Haoussa means "West education is sin", admits the stock of the Islamic Emirate in the north of the Muslim Nigeria.
This poor region has such success.
It is political and requires adequate compliance with the Islamic Rights of Sharia while its staff start fighting against the central government.
These people are first interested in churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram's staff remained extremely active and violated their attacks against police stations.
The government's reactions are like usually the same.
The army surrounds the city and the surrounding is 800 dead.
The founder of Mohammed Yusuf section is captured and killed in order.
Since that moment, the group has been radicalized and left its effect north.
On Wednesday 2010, Jos's attitude will be carried out in the city, where 80 people will die, and then will follow another in the main city of Abuja.
In June, it's again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks the police office at his first self-mortal attack.
And in August, the local Office of the United Nations will be the first international leader.
The creation of terrorist axes in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now concerned with all security specialists.
Now when Al-Kajda of the Islamic Maghreb surrounded Mali and iger and Somalians from the movement of Al-Sababab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new danger for the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, when talking with President Goodluck, Jonathan Alain Juppé said that France is in the state of proficiency and is ready to provide all information.
World by candidates to the President
In the issues of China, Iran or Israel's help, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are prejudiced in simplification and ignorance.
Can weak crisis be managed by America through simple or even simplifying thoughts?
When the president's candidates listened, the electors could think of it.
A few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other have repeated a huge statement and structural instructions in the field of the policy which is already a traditionally strong point of the Republicans.
Often unsubscribed slogans about China, Iran, or helping Israel are among themselves.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the republican "Grand Old Party", threatened the call against the Chinese from the World Trade Organization and their accusation "k for manipulation with their currency", which is the narrow topic of the whole parts of its industry in Asia.
That's worse, if this has to include the launch of trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Ancient Obam's officer in China, and the only candidate with a sophisticated view of the policies, almost struck with a position that "appreciates" emotions.
He demanded a strong but strong dialogue with Peking (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who's on the last places in the election estimates, remains unhearable.
To the picture of President Reagan
Romney also promised military armies to Iran, if they did not succeed in arresting his nuclear program.
"If I'm chosen, I'll catch Iran," he said fanfaronically.
"If Obama is chosen again, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase the military aid to Israel, accusing Obam of disappointing his obligations against this partner.
Business Herman Cain, the second best candidate, shows a deep ignorance of documents.
Recently he called to a close position against the Chinese military threat, because Peking's trying to develop nuclear capacity" - evidently unknownness that China's own atom weapons since 1964!
The Texasian Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to stand against Iran, says about himself that he is ready to send the American Army to Mexico to fight drug cards.
It is also recommended that Cain, Perry and the other candidate Michele Bachman use torture against the terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009.
Everyone is far else than the Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, heavy weight in the foreign policy.
In contrast with the current president, Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won the cold war.
They realize that Obama himself was amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failures of his Naive dialogue with Iran, the "boys" department from Iraq, his excuses relating to Libya, and thus advocate him the pressure of a weak
But the attack isn't even easy.
The population considers the national security policy of President Obama, who removed Ben Ladina, more positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in the military forces that lead to destruction.
And with the arguments that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically to myself to resuscitate its leading position, obama's clothing at the right place.
Northern Stream, new Russian gas entry to Europe
The remote North Stream gas leading directly to East Europe to Russia and leading after the day of the Baltic Sea began to work.
It must add gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian Plynarium Ober, wanted to celebrate this event well.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of States and governments, have participated in the Northern Stream in the last Tuesday, a new gas transport, which is connected directly to Russia and Germany under the sea.
Symbolic German officer Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Minister François Fillon and his netherlands colleague Mark Rutte were jointly controlled by the entry of Russian leading gas into the West-European network.
This new gas transport will begin to switch each year to Western Europe 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas with the first roof of 1 224 km of the Petrohrada region with the country of Mecklembury-Sea.
The second rubber that must be completed at the end of 2012 allows a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is a quantity equal to the whole French deficiency.
And it is already possible to set the third gas trailer on the same path.
For Gazprom, this great building has the character of victory.
In contrast with the project, Poland and the Battle country were strongly protested.
Northern Stream will allow direct gas to Germany without being led by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries are sometimes lost in power: the possibility of pressing Russia by threats to close access to the West European markets is more difficult for them.
The most strongly warmed Varsovia when she did not weaken to compare North Stream to the new German-World Pacte, with a revocation of the alliance between Hitler and Staline at the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means to say that it's politically sensitive.
Western Europe, with its support to this Russian project, has obtained more security of its purchases.
But it is at the price of energy weakness Europe, since the project has created markets between East and West Europes.
Russia was able only five years ago to make its vision of the direct connection between Russia and the rich west countries with high gas demands, which are close to its end.
"This gas lead is the component of our partnership with Russia, the new heat that connects us organically," he confirmed François Fillon in the celebration of this gas and demonstrated the point in which large gas contracts are both political and economically.
This all explains the wide smiles of the leading representatives of Gazprom present in a large number in Lumin, the leading place of gas.
The situation of this gas transport is also a significant technical action.
The under-sea coasts are covered by a steel with a beton floor to be protected from sea vessels.
It stays at the bottom of the sea in the average depth of 200 m.
In his building, it was necessary to avoid mining fields funeral in the second world war.
"For security, they must have been removed or destroyed," says Jens Mâer, the speaker of North Stream.
There were also measures to protect fauna and flowers.
The alone is a long milk of metal weighting as 242 Eiffelovek, which has not been interrupted anywhere or ventilated or holding stations.
One control area should be built near Sweden, but the leader project refused it when the Swedish were only a little desired to see the Russian State company how long it was located at their coasts.
"In the case of a failure, we'll stop the gas pass in less than 1 minute," says Jens Mâer.
In the case of disturbance, gas in the gas transport will be avoided in the air.
However, this case is considered to be a little likely to the manufacturer, that the weights were proposed so that the impatience would occur once in 100,000 years.
The control of the gaze status is carried out by the under-sea robots broken ship while the interior of the gas carrier is controlled by the equipment that circle inside.
This device of a frequency of 1 meter is introduced into the interior of the tube and is pressed with gas.
For the purpose of all three days of the trip of 3 m/s, accurate information on the eventual deformations of metal parts shall be provided.
The remote gas vehicle was proposed to work for fifty years without the need to be a minor right.
The circulation of gas is simply assured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bars at the start and 100 bars in the target.
Five companies were connected to the implementation of this project.
The leader position remains Gazprom, which holds 51%.
The German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Netherlands Gasunie and the French GDF Suez Group (9% each).
These five companies have created a common company called Northern Stream connected with the building and gas operation.
The company has a seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where the opinion is extraordinaryly valuable.
The Gazprom was successfully purchased by this company for five years with which it could be renewed, all its capacity for gas transport.
"Gazprom will have profit from the total capacity, whether the quantity of actually transported gas is any," Jens Mâer states.
The financing of gas expenditure was guaranteed from 30% of the shareholder and from 70% of the bank by loans.
The total costs of work should achieve 7.4 billion euros for both costs.
For the GDF Suez group, the investment costs were 240 million.
But minor actors are sure that their costs will be returned, because only Gazprom risks.
Plynovod comes from the Baltic Sea in Luminos, on the sandy coast with bovine forests.
The ventilations of 4,5 meters high are a gas output door.
The recorders shall measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the combustion gas before transporting into German gas waters.
Since Wednesday, this terminal takes one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Molecuen - Tag recorder
The Italian company Moleskine, which has been founded for fifty years ago, wants to rejoice in writing.
It brings the wheel of the well-being, the hours of the scribes at the light of the light of the light.
The recorder of Molekyne is easily recognized by its black depth tables and its papers will send white colors as if it were a little older.
Because the recorder of Molequin, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Sitting Modo in Milan will then decide to introduce a new design, but distinguished recorder on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then the constant worker for the business, is included in the introduction of a new product.
The recorder is inspired by an old manufacturer technology "moleskin" (imitates cow), which is used, for example, to modify the surface of the labs.
This type of recorder was very appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Molekyne has returned to the movies an old and forgotten object, which was the icon of the pregard artists to the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a leader of the mark at the Modo Modo company.
Success is here.
between 2006 and 2010, the sale was 26% to be located on 12.7 million cousin last year.
The situation is a remote production of the first years when only 3.000 writers were prepared.
Molequin exceeds the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to compose a artificial portrait of the buyer, because the recorder takes business as a student or a professional.
To the picture of the recorder of Molekyne, his owners are people of space, culture, and opened spirit.
A small Italian company, who had 12 employees at its starts, has almost a hundred of them today and since 2008 has two offices, one of whom is in Milan and another in New York.
It sends its recorders to the bookgroup and ®nity of the FNAC trade string to small bottles in the middle of the cities where he was able to set up his identity.
"We followed the spirit of a time and this need for new writing, through the stormful development of e-mails," explains Mary Sebregondi.
This cultural signature provides the development of the registry of Molequina: a recent tag opened the exhibition of the "Record", where the artists or artists have set up their recorder.
In August, at the occasion of the film festival in Locarn, she also introduced new recorders' tables with leopard.
Molekyni benefits from its success and this cultureal auries and diversifies its products: bags, diarrhoea, tubes, appreciation on notebooks ... The tag is expanded to a series of wearers.
Success that raised the dependency: In 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writers of a new page in the history of Molequin.
Why is such a high share of unemployed handicapped work?
Approximately 19% of the handicapped people are looking for work.
Today, 15 weeks are opened for the employment of the handicapped.
In addition to the voluntary public policy in 2005, the percentage of unemployed persons is two times higher than the average, which is 19% over 9% for the whole population.
Is that a bullet?
"No, it supports it, Blanchet, the General Director of the Association Adapt, who organizes the week for the employment of handicaps."
"The progress achieved in 15 years are worthwhile."
"In that time, it wasn't the percentage of unemployment twice, but three times higher."
"There is no longer much more to do."
It is necessary to say that the unemployed handicapped persons are too long before they come to work.
It is an older person: 37% is more than 50 years (17% in average).
They are low: 80% have no maturity, and from 2.3 million high school students are only 10.000 handicapped.
And finally, the unemployment is very expanded: 53% in the hedicate-covered degree of 38% in the meantime.
Shortly these are the criteria that are particularly complicating the employment return and representing "the problem nuclear", according to Christian Grapina, the Director-General of the Tremplin Association, which was established in 1992 to help undertakings accept the handicaped work.
So much about the objects of the vibration.
It remains unsaved, the ways of thinking that certainly develops, but too slow.
In April, IMS-Entreprise for la Cité, the questioning manager has a weak level of knowledge of the handicaped persons with the overcoming idea of persons on the coming cross and psychical or mental failures.
The result is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the objective of employment of 6% of the handicap work set out in the Act of 1987.
The latest known numbers of 2008 are equal to 2.6%.
"Now we move approximately 3%," says Pierre Bla日, the Director-General of the Agefiph organization, committed by choosing taxes from undertakings that do not comply with this law.
It is evidence that the amount of "populated undertakings" is the same as the paid amounts that decreased between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 provincies to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Law of 2005, which increased the contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Bla. "
"But this improvement also demonstrates true consciousness, especially in the large areas."
According to the Ministry of Work, only 59% of businesses from 20 to 49 employees are employed by a handicapped work over 82% of companies are 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What lucky."
Before on Wednesday evening (20h45) the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens have not hidden the joy that will bring them this friendly comfort.
We won't go so far, and we wrote that there was a community between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting near them at the stage of Stade de France's viewpoint, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard were quickly relaxed.
Five months after the wrath of his attacker's gentlemen in the battle against Turkey, the Belgian trainer found his player only words of praise.
"I'm very satisfied with Eden and his progress, and with his love for his land."
"I want to move forward," assures the French Lille player.
It's about the division between his executions in the clubs and the stocks of nationality, it's one and the same, it's justifying."
"I'm in Lille all the year, which isn't the case of gung."
"I need to clean my label."
Hazard, held against Romania on Thursday evening because of this battle against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "made."
However, it could not be mentioned "grace."
Play against Bleus, which has been encouraged since 7 years and in their victories in 1998 and 2000.
"I was a fan," he says.
This needs to contribute more to the "special" character of this meeting.
More about it, because they're Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", it's.
"We crossed up immediately."
"I can play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Well-hearted Leekens remembered the "heart".
"Hrdost" to exterminate the guards of the holiday."
"Hrdost" also observes the quality of "souseds", that France has become a very high level team of something more than a year after trauma in the South African town of Knysna."
"Laurent Bla's made a huge cup of work," he breathed.
Anyway, if Europe's next campaign was missing, the technic ballist would see himself in 2014 in the aircraft with France... Brazil.
"Our little ones become big," he stressed.
"We're just building something, players are ambitional, healthy hunger."
"You're going to know that about the next storage." In fact, against France.
Portugal very self-conscious
The Portuguese cow Paulo Bento starts with a great optimism of the bargaining against Bosnia (22 hours) this center in Lisbon.
In the way there, both teams missed realism.
At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and a happy country.
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
The Portuguese Baltic Representative, whose food is since 2010, is ≥ EUR 2012.
Portugal split from happiness in 90 minutes.
There's one storage and one supporter - Bosna.
At the house of Friday outlet (0-0) in the hell of Bosen Zenica, it seems that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of overwhelming, but it was not able to give such a rare that would take him.
"It's a good outcome that, however, contains risks because we're not getting outside."
But at their home stade de la Luz, in Lisbon, Portugals are convinced that they are prosecuted before the public, which should create a warm chat there, even though the bathroom seems to be "very equilibred," says optimist, but being considering Bento.
"We're expecting a very balanced storage, but we're completely convinced that we can have a plan," said the Portuguese trener of 20 years.
"We still have 50% chances to be for the Euro 2012," however, the following Carlose Queiroze related.
The unresolute Friday travel in Bosnia makes Portugal to give and win.
A disadvantaged stock may be sufficient to the Bosnians who are also going to give .
"It's a good outcome that, however, contains the risk because we haven't done it outside," Bento denys.
"We'll play against a team with great technical quality and available players with great individual quality," added.
Like in Zenic, Portugals will be interested in developing the Bosen team from the beginning of the maximum pressure so that they will not give them the time to think."
A good idea, undermined that this time will appear to be realistic.
