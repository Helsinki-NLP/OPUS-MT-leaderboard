about how long are these symptoms present?
and all pains in the breast cell should be treated as such, especially taking into account your age
and with high temperature
and also needs to check the level of your cholesterine and artificial pressure
And do you have a high temperature now?
And are you trying this pain in the breast cell now?
Besides whether it is difficult for you to breathe.
And can you tell me what other symptoms you have other than these?
And how high your temperature was
And I'm still in my hands.
And I've got a little prostitute with ..
And I have a really strong pain today in the tissue cell
And if this is the time of the shadow of the shadow which you are subject
and pain in the breast cell
And I think I've got a little temperature.
And I want you to describe what the fat cell you're doing.
and they also have a little higher temperature
and with your diabetes history
And you know, it feels like my breast will be cut off.
And you know, people's keeping on me.
and you're feeling pain in the tissue cell
And you said this was the pressure in the tissue cell.
Someone in the family has problems with heart, heart failure, myocard infarct, high level of cholesterin, high art pressure
Any other symptoms or problems noted by you and with mouse pain?
Do you have other houses because you have similar symptoms?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Are you trying a picture now?
Do you still feel pain in the breast cell
'Cause it's the grip season
but we should also not be careless because of the pain in the breast cell with a cardiac nature
However, the more important problem is this pain in the breast cell
But I have difficult breathing.
But I know that many people's on me.
but we have to get to treat any pain in the tissue cell with the maximum seriousness.
But you're breathing well now, right?
'Cause I don't remember this pain in the tissue.
It seems like someone's hitting your neck cell.
You're still feeling a fucking shot.
Do they regret the symptoms of bad self - feeling?
Do you have any other chronic diseases such as high blood pressure or something like that?
Do you have any other chronic diseases or medical problems such as diabetes?
Do you feel that you're feeling at this pain in the tissue cell?
Do you have high artificial pressure?
Do you have this clothing?
Do you know what symptoms she had?
Do you see this picture?
Drink a lot of weight today
But I'm going through the diabetes tests.
But she had the symptoms exactly as I did.
How high is your temperature?
What are you doing with the art pressure?
if you still have a high temperature
if you have temperature thirty-eight or nine or more
if you think your symptoms or problems guarantees the improvement of external aspects
I had the temperature yesterday.
I've got a little temperature yesterday.
I had the temperature yesterday.
I'm trying here in the tissue cell, I'm getting pain.
I also have a little difficult breathing.
I'll send you a picture.
I'm testing some pain in my breast today.
I have a little disease today and the temperature has risen.
I think it's a grip.
I think it's a grip in a easy form.
Remembers this, as if a very hard person is sitting on your neck?
All this started almost at the same time with pain and temperature increase
I'm testing the pain in the middle of the breast.
It gives it as pain in the tissue cell
I've got it in my breast.
It's in the center of my breast cell.
It's in the center of the breast cell
I've got pain in my neck.
I'm very worried about this pain in my neck.
I want you to describe this pain in my breast.
as high artificial pressure or diabetes
exactly in the centre of the breast cell
from high temperature you can now take tahipirin in the form of ice
And now, Mary, tell me, how many days you have shown these symptoms?
Now you said you felt pain in your breast.
I feel a little pain in my breast
Well, if you have any other symptoms other than pain
Or someone's sitting on your shoulder?
Exactly the same high temperature and temperature, muscle and muscle pain
pain directly in the centre of my neck
Show me on this picture where you feel pain.
Because you have a high temperature
so you think some of these symptoms could be with a term?
So, your children have some of these same symptoms?
Tell me about your pain in the breast cell
The temperature is increased by night
The temperature I had in the last two days
The temperature began to rise last night
This is Dr. Porter at the approved room of aid
Okay, can you tell a little more about your breast pain?
Well, I feel pain in front of my body, here in my breast.
Well, I feel the pain in my breast.
So when I feel pain in my breast
What kind of pain do you feel in your breast?
When you started feeling this pain in your breast?
Where exactly are you feeling pain in your breast?
Where you just feel this pain in your breast
you're trying to feel something like that in your breast.
You know, I have a diabetes and all that.
You said you'd experience this pain in the breast cell.
Quickly identified cumulative disease of coronaviral infection (COVID-19) in the Union and in the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative disease of coronaviral infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the Union / > the economic area and in the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, despite the different developments in different countries, the COVID-19-pandemic is intensely growing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive treatments, the preparation level of COVID-19 patients needing treatment and, in particular, intensive treatment should be increased.
On 31 December 2019, Uhan of the Chinese province of Hubai was established a number of cases of non-etheological illness.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Control and Profile of Disasters reported that the infectioner is a new type of coronavir, currently as a coronavir of a severe respiratory syndrome of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since this time, the disease called SARS-CoV-2 was called Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19).
According to the data available today, approximately 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 have a easy form of disease, i.e. in the form of respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, most of them are healthy.
Approximately 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases are developed in a severe form of hospitalisation, and in the rest of 6 per cent it is critical when intensive treatment is required.
The level of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 consists of approximately 4%.
The analysis of the trends of COVID-19 cumulative disease in each country of the Union (EU) and of the Economic Zone (EEA) and in the United Kingdom is considered and is carried out in comparison with the trends in the Chinese province of Hubai.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 disease in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK
Following the invasion in China, COVID-19 was spread to other countries, and the rest of the world COVID-19 is currently developing the same dynamic as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 Pandemy.
The Eurosurveillance magazine of 5 March 2020, Mr. Species (Spiteri) and its colleagues reported the first cases of COVID-19 disease in response to the criteria for which the WHO determines the condition of disease.
The first three cases in the EU/EEE were registered in France on 24 January 2020 — all three diseases returned from Uhan China province Hubai.
On 15 March 2020, the cases of COVID-19 infection were detected in all 30 EU/EEC countries and in Great Britain, and 39 768 infection cases and 1 727 in which 17 750 cases, including 1 441 from the original origin, were established only in Italy.
Definition of cumulative quantity and cumulative disease COVID-19
The Centre for Control and Profile of Disabilities (ECDC) updates the number of cases registered by COVID-19 every country of the world from official sources such as the Ministries of Health of these countries, national and region.
These data are used to analyze the trends of the COVID-19 distribution in the EU/EEE and in the United Kingdom and to compare them with the data in Italy.
As a level of the distribution of active cases COVID-19, the total cumulative disease of COVID-19 was calculated in 14 days, taking into account the normal flow of COVID-19 in each EU/EEE countries and in the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also set the cumulative number of cases fixed in each country on 8:00, 15 March 2020, compared to Italian data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 development trends in EU/EEE countries and UK
The COVID-19 development trends for the 14-day period of COVID-19 in the EU/EEE countries and in the United Kingdom in general corresponded to the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubai (section 1).
COVID-19 in the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom in general began to grow about 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 a rare spring of this indicator (additional material).
This was primarily determined by a streaming increase in cases of disease registered in Italy, but in all other countries of the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom, similar trends for the growth of cumulative disease COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 disease in EU/EEE countries and in Great Britain in comparison with the similar indicator for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to this data, the total number of cases already registered at 8:00, 15 March in 15 other EU/EEC countries and in Great Britain is compared to the number fixed in Italy only about 3 weeks ago.
Our results testify that the number of cases registered by COVID-19 in the EU/EEE and in the United Kingdom is rapidly increased.
Monitored COVID-19 cumulative disease trends allow to assume that the pandemia is developed at a comparative speed in all countries.
Yet, despite the different aspects in different countries, the difference between the reactions adopted by national public health authorities, and may be different criteria for the recognition of disease and different rules for the selection of patients for the analysis of COVID-19, including the ‘foresting’ test.
At the beginning of March 2020, the doctors in the regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive therapy, and that MMI noted that hospitals and intensive treatment in these regions were already completed.
The data on the invasion of patients with COVID-19 in the hospital and (or) intensive therapy in the EU/EEE are available only for 6% and 1% of the cases respectively (no data submitted).
However, a systematic collection of such information is necessary to comply with the current observations that are the number of registered cases and the number of cases.
According to the results of the study carried out in 2010-2011, a significant dilution of cooks in intensive therapy and intensive inflammation is observed: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 cocks per 100 000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 cookies in intensive therapy and intensive injury for 100.000 populations in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the COVID-19 risk assessment scenarios for the modeling of healthcare systems with evaluation data on hospitalization of infected COVID-19 in each EU/EEE countries and in the United Kingdom, where the risk of insufficiency of cooks in intensive therapy is over 90%.
Since cases are currently grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive therapy are usually serving the population of a certain territory group, information on cases of infection and quantity of coke in intensive therapy is recommended to provide at the level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territory Units for statistics (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries are that COVID-19's COVID Pandemy is intensely developed in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The country, hospitals and intensive treatment should therefore be prepared for a SARRS-CoV-2 contact infection, which is not expensive for long-term, and to increase the number of patients with COVID-19, needs for medical assistance and, in particular, intensive therapy, which, for example, can be observed in the damage of the regions of Italy.
As reported in the last report of the ECDC on the risk assessment results, the importance of maintaining the SARS-COV-2 distribution has an operational, enhanced and comprehensive approach with the following transition from reducing the consequences, since, taking into account the predicted stream growth of diseases, the decisions of persons and hospitals may not have enough time to think, take and correct their responsible measures, if such measures are not taken before.
The outcome of the risk assessment report also includes measures in the field of public health to reduce the impact of the pandemia.
The countries have only a little time during which they can enhance their efforts in the field of control to slow up the SARS-CoV-2 distribution and reduce their health protection systems.
If not, the health system in other EU/EEE countries will be confronted with an intensive hepatitis in the nearest days or weeks.
The 2019 coronaviral infection (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus of a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), became a tragedy for ≥ 80 000 people in China and other countries of the world.
In 2003, the SARRS-CoV-homological virus, which caused a severe intense respiratory syndrome to develop in thousands of people, may also be transmitted from flying muscles and causes similar symptoms using similar mechanism.
However, the COVID-19 is different from the less difficulty and the lower level of disease than the SARS, but it is much more infected and affected by older people than young men and men more often than women.
In response to the stream growth of p's new diseases in this article, the current and full-term review of the quickly developing subject of the investigation has been conducted.
We will consider the bases of epidemiology, ethology, virusology, diagnostics, treatment, further flowing and the profile of this disease.
Although the answers to many questions are still to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and enhance dangerous diseases.
The festival (Chinese New Year), which was held on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedentable and unforgettable event for all Chinese who were urged to stay home for the whole holiday and for many weeks after it.
Taking into account the high comparison with the coronavirus (CoV) in 2003, the World Health Protection (WHO) called this virus SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding illness of Coronavirus Infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic was started in the Chinese city of Uchan, and it was quickly spread throughout the country and then nearly 50 other countries of the world.
More than 80,000 patients were reported on 2 March 2020 in cases of COVID-19, and more than 40,000 patients had been healed, and more than 3,000 patients had ended.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "fair number one for society" and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.日bi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than two months of COVID-19, including articles on its virusology, epidemiology, ethology, diagnostic and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, in which the sequences of the virus were determined by a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to collect the results of research in the new and quickly developing area.
As far as possible, we are trying to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another caused coronaviral disease — the coronavirus of the near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts on the profile of disease and the predictment of the cycle of disease, and some other matters are not less important.
Coronaviruses have been traditionally addressed to the number of patogens that are not deadly dangerous for humans and are mainly caused by approximately 15 per cent of general respiratory diseases 4.
Nevertheless, in this century, we have been doubled with high-patogeneous human coronavirus, namely with the coronavirus of a heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus of a near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused the emergency of diseases originally in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and spread to many other States with a terrible level of disease and disorder.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third emergency of the coronaviral infection in the history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the report on non-resident cases was first reported to the National CNA Health Commission of 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, genetic consequences of virus were issued.
On 15 January 2020, the first mortal case was registered in Uhan.
However, the epidemic was quickly spread to neighborhood cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the infection of the medium of the humans has made it possible to provide the possibility of transmission of virus from humans.
On 23 January, Uhan was introduced a carantine and stopped the urban public transport.
On 24 January, the first study of this disease was noted that 21 of 41 patients with a coronaviral infection had contacts with the market of sea products in Mr. Uhan, which was considered an exposure point of infection from non-animal.
On 30 January, the WHO announced that the coronavirus is a global emergency situation in the field of public health.
At the time of the preparation of this report, the disease was spread throughout China and has already been around 50 other countries worldwide (section 2).
In view of the effortful development of the situation, the effort and the risk of emergency are still to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, after a lot of studies in which 8 866 patients, including 4 021 patients with COVID-19, were presented an updated epidemic development image (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
The SARS-CoV-2 infection was subjected to all age groups, but mainly patients were diseased between 30 and 65 years.
Almost half (47.7 per cent) of infected were more than 50 years of age, totally few — 20 years of age, and only 14 infected have not been 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 in men above (0.31/100 000) than in women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clasters mainly in the province of Hubai and nearby regions.
In the meantime of the COVID-19 symptoms, 5 (2 to 9 days had been diagnosed.
The incubation period was averagely 4.8 (3.0-7.2) day.
Since the symptoms were shown to death, 9,5 (4.8-13) were spent in the meantime.
Basic reproduction indicator (R0) from 3.77 (95 % CI: 3.51-4.05), and R0 from 2.23 to 4.82.
By 23 January 2020, the number of infected persons co-operated with the high transportation of China’s New Year was exposed.
The death of patients with diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the corrected ≥ 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors in the case of COVID-19 infection were: sex (man), age (≥ 60) and severe nervous events.
Coronaviruses constitute a subsequent subsequence of major inflammation viruses containing one of the meaningful NCBs.
They can be divided into four kinds, such as alpha, beta, gamma and delta, from which alpha and betacoronavirus, likely, affect people.
In the case of the injury of the type SARS and MERS glucoprotein of ship-videos (S) cell cell receptors of the type 2 of angiotensin-converting farmer (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidae-4 (DPP4) are associated with the cell cells, according to the event of the membrane synthesis.
Cytoplasm is released by virus NCB genetic; after the replication of virus genetic genetic NCB, the NCB generates virus containing proteins with glucoproteins and nucleocapsite proteins, then generating virus containing vesiccules, which are then combined with membrane cells, freeing the virus.
The first reports on the genetic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 were reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, a gene of 99.98 per cent of which corresponds to 10 sequences in the first place of the disease in the market of Juanan products in Uhan.
Genetic SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With the promoting electronic microscope of the SARS-CoV-2 part, the ultrate of the human respiratory episode was found.
The ACE2 farm is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 relates to human pharmaceutical ACE2 more than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to have a less difficulty than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also generate an earlier short-life white, encoded orf3b, and a secreted white, encoded orf8.
The orf3b orf3b virus SARS-CoV-2 may play some role from the view of the virus pathogenicity and deteriorate the IFNb expression; but orf8 does not contain any functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, the collection of authors in Chapter of Jou (Zhou) held reports on the electron tomography of the ACE2 full-dimensional farming structure with authorisation of 2.9 A in combination with the transporter of aminocide B0AT.
They discovered that this complex, in which it is open and closed to, is as a dimension and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can connect two S-proteins, which serves as evidence in the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be therapy with a mixture in the conduct of a medical skining in order to reduce the infection of SARS-CoV-2.
Origin and interim host
It is known that the source and SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were flying mouses, from which the virus was translated to the man through citizens and wheels respectively.
By means of the SARS-CoV-2 comparison filogue with other coronaviruses, it was established that I was the first SARRS-CoV-2 farmers, since the new virus was 96% identical to the SARS coronavirus, namely the coronaviruses of SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unlike what kind of intermediate master, which causes the virus to overcome the species barier and to infect humans; the way of transfer is still to be detected.
Mr. Czy (Ji) with colleagues suggested that the transmission of virus from flying muscles to humans became serpents in the process of the homosexual recombination in S-proteine.
Following their investigation, Chinese scientists from Guangjou suggested that pangolines are long-term milk, which are often used in traditional Chinese medical medicals, I are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this is based on 99 percent genetic comparison between the pangoline coronavir and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1 per cent, which is divided between both genes, is very large, therefore it is considered that results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (section 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet.
In laboratory conditions SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive 48 hours in the dry middle and up to 5 days at the temperature of below 20 °C and 40 to 50 % of the heat.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolete and inflammation up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; efficiently block the virus activity can be efficiently blocked by efficiency, 75 percent of materials, chlorocontaining means, candy acid, chloroform and other solvent solvents, but not chloride.
Human population at all does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are aware of the new virus.
There are no data on the detailed surveys of immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can do only to earlier studies of other coronavirus, first in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (section 4).
As usual, the master’s body’s virus will recognize a expected immune system by means of representative receptors, including C-type receptors, Toll-like recipients, NOD-like recipients and RIG-I-like recipients.
By means of various mechanisms, the virus produces an expression of combustion factors, the creation of dendric cells and the synthesis of interferons of type I, which maintain the distribution of virus and enhance the fagocytosis of macropharmactics in relation to virus antigens.
However, using the N-black SARS-CoV can avoid immune reactions.
A adaptive immune reaction is involved in combating virus.
T-limfocytes, including T-cells CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in the protection of the body.
T-cells CD4+ stimulate the generation of virus-specific antenders in B-cells, and T-cells CD8+ directly kill the infected cell virus.
T-Helpers produce anticipated cytokines that help protecting cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T cell functions by providing their programmed loss.
Human immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, also plays an important role in combating virus infection.
For example, anticipates from a healthy patient, neutralization of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system is the local education of a large number of free radicals, which may cause serious damage to the and other bodies, and in the worst scenario to lead to polyorganic insufficiency and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, for which a classic manifestation is more likely to affect older people with associated pathologies and female women.
The probability of infektion above for people who are affected by a large number of viruses or who are affected by the immune system.
According to the outcome of the first 425 cases of infection in Uhan, the average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, the study of 1 099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days, and that is, from 0 to 24 days.
The more recently described investigation of demography data of 8 866 cases showed that the incubation period of 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) day.
For healthcare bodies, it is very important to correct the periods of the curant measures introduced with the most precise estimates of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus of infected people who have been infected without a sense.
Common on the 14-day currency of persons, name of contacts with virus or infected virus.
Should the duration be extended until 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which may be the only manifestation of other symptoms, such as dry, difficult breathing, muscle diseases, environmental pain, hair pain, mildness, breast-feeding, diarrhoea, diarrhoea, heavy and heat.
Some patients have been reported a sequence and/or an hypohide after a week after the illness started.
In severe cases, the rapid progress of the disease was developed, and heavy respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acid and coagulation developed in patients.
Patients with high temperature and/or symptoms of respiratory illness and severity should be checked on virus for the early diagnosis even if there is no pathology on tissue cell photos.
The demographic study at the end of December 2019 discovered the symptom distribution indicators: 98 per cent is high temperature, 76 per cent is dry, 55 per cent is a diarrhoea and 3 per cent is a diarrhoea; 8 per cent of patients needed experienced ventilation.
Similar results were obtained from two recent studies of infection in the family and the transfer of virus from unsimptome infected.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in the study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms had also high temperature (98%), drought (47%) and excretion (55%).
However, 80% of them needed experienced ventilation, this higher indicator than among patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher share of MERS than COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also observed diarrhoea (26 per cent) and throat pain (21 per cent).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperature (99-100%), dry ≥ 29-75%), diarrhoea (40-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and hair pain (13-25%), and experienced ventilation of patients is required of 14-20%.
On 14 February, COVID-19 was 2 per cent, and the total number of cases in the world reached 66 576.
In comparison with this indicator, the SARS was 10% of 8 096 cases in November 2002.
In the case of MERS, the demography study carried out in June 2012 showed 37 per cent of 2 494 cases.
Following the earlier studies, the basic reproduction indicator (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was identified at 6.47 at 95 % of the confidential interval (CI) in sections 5.71 to 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Comparison SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, levels of  skuld and R0 contained in Table 1.
The above indicators testify for the higher ability of SARS-CoV-2 to distribute compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the level of innovation in the case of new virus infection below compared to the two last.
Therefore, maintaining the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Classic manifestation often occurs when infected in a family or group of people, together, for any reason or proof, together on any transport, such as on a cross liner.
Patients were often expelled in Mr. Uhan or in other affected regions, lived there or contacted with infected or sick during the last two weeks before the start of the disease.
However, according to the reports presented, humans may be virus carriers without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and the treated patients from the hospital may again become virus carriers, and this is anxiety for the duration of the currency.
In the early stage, the normal or decreased number of leucocytes (always limfocytes) in the blood perifer.
For example, 1 099 patients with COVID-19 were established with leucocytes < 4x109/L, including leucocytes < 1x109/L, and increased asparagin-aminotranspherasis and virusemia.
In the blood of some patients, increased levels of fever, muscular fermentation and myoglobin were found, and most patients were observed increasing levels of C reaction and blood erythrocytes.
Patients with a severe duration of D-dimmer disease, the product of fibre disruption in the blood was increased and the number of limfocytes continued to be reduced.
Most patients with COVID-19 in the rentgenographic study of the breast cell have been detected pathology characterising unbalanced dilutions from both sides or deteriorations of the type “mate glass”.
Patients often develop athical nerve, heavy damage and heavy respiratory disease.
In the development of the OCR, non-controlled fuel, weight recovery and progressive fibrosis results in an advanced gas pollution.
The disfunction of types I and II pneumatics decreases the level of over-active units and increases the overall burden, thus decreasing the ability to expand and increase the risk of loss.
Thus, the worst results of the study are often matching the most difficult cases of illness.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstration of pneumatics, the form of gialin membranes and intermediate limfocytary infiltration, and multiple nuclear synthetics of cells in patients who died from disease, correspond to virus infection pathology and ARZ and similarly found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criteria for the diagnosis of the COVID-19, the NCB SARS-CoV-2 was determined by a polymerate heat reaction with reverse transcriptase (CCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, taking into account the high level of false negative results that could have the development of the epidemic, since 13 February 2020, China began to diagnose clinical evidence (without confidence exclusively on the CCP with reverse transcriptase).
The situation was similar to the SARS diagnosis.
Thus, it is critically important for effective diagnosis and is necessary to compute the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and the results of the study.
On 14 February 2020, the group of specialists under the leadership of Mr. Fenj Čjan (Feng Zhang) described the application of the SHERLOCK method, repeated on the CRISPR, to find SARS-CoV-2; this method allows the synthetic fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 RNS at the height of 20 × 10-18 ml/l to 200 × 10-18 ml/l (10-100 copies per microlitre of the original model) with indicators less than in time without the use of complex equipment.
This new methodology, if it succeeded in checking on clinical medicinal products, may significantly increase the sensitivity of the tests and the satisfaction of them.
In the absence of experience of anti-earlier anti-coronavirus, doctors may mainly provide patients with COVID-19 only supporting therapy, attempting to apply any therapy methods used or used in other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other virus diseases (Tab(2).2).
These therapeutic methods include current or potential use of antiviral medicines, immunity suppliers, steroides, plasma health results of patients, Chinese traditional medication and psychological support.
Even plasma has been used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies will then be able to repeat anti-etils and vaccines for the fight against virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is primarily attacked, as well as may be at least affected by other organs exposing ACE2, such as iron-cookies and crafts.
However, the distortion and refusal of breathing organs are the main threat and cause of the death of patients.
In order to facilitate symptoms and salvation of life, it is therefore critically important to support respiratory functions, including general oxygen therapy, high supply to oxygen, non-invasive experimental ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, which is designed depending on the severity of illness.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms are supported in the form of extracorporal memorandum of gender (ECMO), modified extrapolmonal blood treatment methods used to treat a threat to life of heart or respiratory insufficiency.
Moreover, the most important importance for patients with SARS-CoV-2 is to maintain water-sol balance, prevent and treat secondary infections and seven choices, as well as the protection of the functions of living important bodies.
It is known that the cytokine storm is the result of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected by SARS and MERS virus.
The cytokine storm is a form of a systemic refreshing process developing in response to a series of cytokins, including TNFa, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNb, IFNb, IFNg and MCP-1.
These cytokins provoke immunocytes to emissions of a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of OPS development and polyorganic insufficiency.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients in heavy state, the most important is to increase immunity.
Corticosteroides and tocilizumab, monochlorides and antitechnologies were used to treat cytokine storms as an interlacin-6 inhibitor.
In the number of other methods of treatment of cytokine storm pressure, there is a modulation of immune reaction to T-cell control; the blocking of IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF cytokines; yanus-kinasis pressure; blinatumamab, cytokine signals subpresors 4 and hystondeacetalas inhibitors.
In order to decrease the severity of the ecological processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroides are largely applied as immunity suppliers.
Steroids in large doses, however, do not benefit from the treatment of severe damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they may cause serious side effects, especially the abuse of osteonecrosis, which significantly deteriorate the prognoses.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium-doses are recommended to use carefully when treating patients with COVID-19 in critical state.
There is no effective antiviral therapy at the time of this document.
However, the internal introduction of Rendesivir, nuclear analogue, was effectively treated by the American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is recently an antiviral antiviral medicine, initially aged by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later reddexivir also demonstrates the possibility of deteriorating other viruses with a single-start NCB, including MERS and SARS viruses.
With the confidence in these data, the Gilead company has given the Chinese medical compound in order to conduct couple studies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are expected with impatience.
Moreover, as alternatives for therapy of patients with severe respiratory symptoms, bar-tinib, a-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were proposed.
Combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir may be conducted by diaries, fever, throat, dietary and other side effects.
The interaction of these medicines with other medicinal products designated to patients should be carefully followed.
Plasmoid health of patients and you are ancient
In patients, healing from infectious disease, treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease or protection of health population has been used for a long time.
And in fact, the health of patients often contains a high number of antigens for the fight against pathogen.
Anthony is in immunoglobuline produced by B-limfocytes to combat patogens and other internal objects; they recognize from there patogen molecules and neutralize them directly.
In this proposal, there was a plasma of the blood models of a group of patients treated from COVID-19, which then introduced 10 painful patients.
Over 24 hours, their symptoms improved, reduced the heat of burning and virus load and increased blood saturation with oxygen.
However, in order to suggest that this method be applied massively before therapy specifics, it is necessary until the check and non-explications have been carried out.
Furthermore, with regard to the efficacy therapy, some of the insufficiencies of plasma should be studied carefully.
For example, anticipations can stimulate the immune system too much and cause a cytokine emission syndrome, which, in view of the existence, constitutes a potential threat to life.
The anticipation in blood is usually not high, and the plasmas for the treatment of patients in critical state are much required.
It is easy to set up and produce specific anticipations quickly enough to combat global epidemies.
Thus, more important and more important to select B-cells of health of patients and to identify the genetic code of anticipates or to carry out the screening in order to find anti-titols against critically important virus whites.
So we're going to go to the mass production of an anthree.
China's traditional medication for the treatment of various diseases for thousands of years.
However, its efficiency is significantly depending on the consistency of the components of the formula, which is different from the diagnosis of the disease in the Chinese traditional medical theories.
Most effective components are still not adequate or undetermined materials, since the designation and checking of these components or their optimal combination is an employee.
Currently, because there is an effective specific of the COVID-19 treatment, the Chinese traditional medicine was one of the main alternative methods for treatment of patients with a light and average hepatitis or for patients who are healing after a severe stage of disease.
For example, the capsules Shu Fen Cze Du (Shu Feng Jie Du) and the capsules Lenn Hua Cin Ven (Lian Hua Qing Wen) were recognised effectively in the treatment of COVID-19.
The largest proportion of patients with COVID-19 was noted in a number of provinces of China, in which Chinese traditional medication was used in the treatment of 87% of patients, including in Ghanes (63.7%), Ninse (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in the province of Hubai, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for treatment only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, was fixed the lowest share of health (13%).
However, this is a quite deep comparison, since the disease should be taken into account with other effect factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues, on the basis of which the treatment was compared exclusively by the methods of western medical and combinated treatment on the methods of west medical and Chinese traditional medication.
They discovered that the time of normalisation of the body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and medical assistance under the stationary conditions was less sensitive for patients who had the combination of western and Chinese traditional medical methods than for patients who had been treated only in western methods.
The most wonderful is that the percentage of patients who had been injured by the symptoms (effective to difficulty) was noted below in the group treated by the combination of the methods of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only by western methods (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent), and the level of the first group was lower than in the second (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
However, Chinese traditional medical safety needs more controlled studies in larger and more regions.
The particular interest is also obtaining a mechanism for describing and explaining the efficiency of components used in Chinese traditional medical methods, or their combination.
Patients who have suspicioned or confirmed the presence of COVID-19 are mainly in fear of anxiety and even anxiety, and those who are covered by the karantine also experience disappointment, unity and extreme disappointment.
Furthermore, symptoms of infections such as liquor, hypo - and hypertension, as well as side effects of the treatment, such as corticosteroide unsounding, may cause further great anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the insufficiency of the SARS virus, a number of psychiatric diseases, including depression crown, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitements, psychiatric symptoms, delaria and even their behavior.
The commitment to monitoring contacts and karantines in the number of measures taken by healthcare bodies to maintain the COVID-19 epidemic may increase the anxiety and feelings of the guilty of infection, karantine and a climate on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be given to patients with COVID-19, suspicious and contacted them, as well as all other people that it requires.
In the context of the psychological support, multiprofessions of psychiatric assistance should be formulated, adjusted clearly and accurately updated information on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and use electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in the interruption of the transmission of animal weapons of infections and infected persons to stimulating hosts and are often applied in addition to antiviral therapy used to maintain epidemies caused by new virus.
The work was carried out on the establishment of vaccines based on S-protein, for which you are a long-life and high-active antidepreciation and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
In the course of animal studies, living weak vaccines from SARS virus were held.
However, before the beginning of clinical studies, this vaccine is needed to be determined in natural conditions when they are used in age patients, the model of infection of doses and the degree of protection against the infection of zone viruses.
It may be that the SARS virus has fallen 17 years ago, and no new case has been reported.
At the same time, constraint events and categories of illness caused by MERS, which are born in the Middle East and spread to other regions by maintaining areas of areas of endemic residence.
For the fight against MERS, vaccinations with the use of inactivated virus, plasma DNA, virus vectors, nanocytes, viral particulates and recombinant white elements have been used, and some of these have passed on animals.
Once a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunity persons, it is an urgent and critically important task that requires decisions to keep a busy epidemic.
However, serious difficulties are stated for the period (in average 18 months), for the repair of the vaccine, and for the dynamic change of coronavirus.
As an earlier non-life, COVID-19 only begins to demonstrate the full image of the disease fluid from thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually cure without difficulties.
However, COVID-19, similarly SARS and MERS, also with high frequency of complications and high disorder among patients with severe disease.
In this regard, it is critically important for health institutions to establish a diagnostic model of disease in order to determine the priority of their measures, especially in the areas where the lack of resources is observed.
The currently presented clinical studies may affect the prediction of the disease fluid in patients with COVID-19 or be held with it (Tab-33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the disease fluid caused by SARS, which also corresponds to the truth in case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 is primarily affecting patients aged 30 to 65 years, 47.7 per cent of whom over 50 years of age, given above in 8 866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive therapy were more likely to have source diseases and difficulties, and they were significantly older than those who did not need such therapy (in average 66 years against 51 years), which proved that the age is a prognosic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Pol: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men above (0.31/100 000 against 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Sickness and complication: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive therapy are higher than the possibility of developing strict miocardial and arithmic damage.
Cardiac events were also the major cause of death of patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be associated with ACE2-local holgiocytes, which could cause injury in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that the age and sources of diseases are closely linked and can reduce the results.
Rejections found in laboratory studies: C-reaction level in the blood reflects the hepatic or weight injury and is considered as a potential prognosic factor for disease fluid, therapy reactions and health.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the C-reactive level, the severity of disease and the prediction of COVID-19.
Moreover, a higher level of lactatedehydrogenase, asparagine-aminotranspherase, alanine-aminotranspherase and creatininese can also be predicted.
These farms in large numbers are allocated by various bodies, especially with heart and sand, and their emissions occur when weighing.
That is why they are traditionally markers of heart - or - female dysfunction.
Basic clinical symptoms: In order to predict results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19 and other factors, data should be taken into account for the rentgenographic study of the breast cell and the development of clinical symptoms during time.
Steroid exposure: as described above, the steroides are immunity engines, widely used for infectional diseases as additional therapy in order to decrease the hepatitis of the ecological process.
Since the treatment of patients with severe forms of SARS was largely used by corticosteroides, many of the viruses have developed a vacuum osteonecrosis that causes life-invalidity and low quality of life.
Therefore, if the use of steroides is necessary for treatment with COVID-19 patients, these medicines should be indicated in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the background of the COVID-19, many patients suffer from unpredicted strong stress, since they often have to endure the depth of the coran periods, to cope with high undeterminedness and to observe the death of their relatives and other patients.
In order to reduce the stress of such patients and to help them return to normal life, psychological consultations should be conducted and long-term supported.
According to the current demographic studies, the COVID-19 epidemia appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as other coronavirus that cause usual disorder diseases may be successfully multiplied in the breathing ways and cause symptoms or not to cause symptoms at the early stage of infection.
Therefore, patients whose early stage of illness or whose period of incubation has not yet been completed may, by conducting their normal life, spread virus in significant scales that are able to be epidemiologically controlled.
However, SARS-CoV virus transmission was considered when patients were sick, while most of the cases in the early stage of infection did not occur.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemia is much more serious than SARS, and it is more difficult to control it.
It is currently a great work in China that has been announced by the universal karantine in Mr. Uhan and neighbors, as well as the long-term karan regime for all the people to stop the SARS-CoV-2 distribution of virus.
Although these measures are a great economy and other areas of life in the country, the number of new patients discovered are reduced, which is stated in the delay of the expansion levels.
The most optimistic estimates of the disease will end to March and the stage of disturbance will be extended between 3 and 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hanter (Paul Hunter) and the colleagues underlined that the COVID-19, which looks much more infected than SARS, would not end in 2020.
The researchers of the group of Ira Longini (Ira Longini) set up a model to predict the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two thirds of the world population.
The group of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in narrow and hair grass taken in patients, health and hospitals two weeks ago, which indicates that the new virus could be a similar influenza.
However, reducing the number of new cases in China is expected to indicate that the currently applied effects may have been achieved.
According to the original prognoses, Ebola's illness had to be killed up to a million people and to become a cause of the loss of half million patients.
However, on the basis of a severe cure and isolation of diseases, finally, it was possible to be controlled.
There is a chance that, like SARS-CoV virus, the ability to infect SARS-CoV-2 virus may be weak, and in time it will disappear or become a less pathogen virus with a person.
The comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic is below with SARS and MERS epidemies (section 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterised by a high speed of transfer by a virus, or by a rubber, as well as by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the cave, which means that it is also an oral-effective way of transfer.
According to one of the recent studies, 41 per cent of the 138 studies may have occurred infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical staff.
It is therefore necessary to take serious precautions for the protection of the population, especially health careers, families, colleagues and even foreign contacts with patients or infected.
The first line of defense in combating the reduction of the risk of infektion is the carrying of a mask for ≥; and the chirurgical masks, and the respirators of N95 (series No. 1860s) helped to control the distribution of virus.
The chirurgical masks do not allow microcappes of liquidity from potentially infected flying in the air and sitting on the surfaces of which they can be transferred to the surroundings.
However, only class N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) can protect virus from breathing from 10 to 80 nm, only 5 per cent of virus; SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, both of which are about 85 nm.
Since parts can even be passed through five chirurgical masks combined together, medical agents directly contacting patients should have the N95 class masks (Series No. 1860s) rather than the chirurgical masks.
Besides the mask, medical agents should carry a protective chalat in the form to further reduce the possibility of contact with virus.
Viruses may also fall into organism through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite the mask of class N95; the virus may have fallen into its body through the burning eyes.
Therefore, medical agents should also carry out transparent faces or protective points of a closed type.
It is recommended that all people in the suffering or potentially threatened regions are more frequently advised to disabilize their hands with deficiencies, try not to get out of the house, keeping self-isolation and contacting potentially infected people.
Distance acceptable to the patient is considered a race of approximately a meter.
These measures reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of virus.
Despite the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had not been previously compared, the high level of SARS-CoV, which was reported on 7 January 2020, had to become anxious sign for China, taking into account the experience they had received during the surplus of the SARS in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Centre for Sickness Controls to Mr. Uhanh calmed the citizens, reporting that the new virus has low contaxicity and reproductiveness when transferring from humans to humans and that prevention and control of disease is not a problem.
This statement decreased significantly the stress, especially during the period when the whole country was ready to celebrate the New Year of China, and a critically important time was lost when the disease could be maintained in some of Mr. Uhana with minimum losses.
China's healthcare bodies may adopt this severe lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, healthcare authorities should be: (1) make more careful public statements, since each word is considered to be citizens and may affect their attitude and decisions; (2) more carefully follow and respond to the necessary information from the clinic, not to expect of the official reports from the doctors and factors; (3) to make more determined measures to maintain the potential epidemic at its early phases of development and not to emphasize the public; and (4) to carry out more official and effective learnings to improve the level of information of the population on the epidemic diseases and the regular verification and improvement of the public reaction system.
The COVID-19 episode, caused by an earlier unexpected coronavirus of a severe breathing syndrome of the second type (SARS-CoV-2), began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the illness covered the whole China and was spread in 50 countries of the world at the time of the present document.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronavir of a heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of the COVID-19 similar symptoms of a heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS), COVID-19 felt a receptive SARS.
However, between COVID-19 and SARS there are some significances of deficiencies that are significant to the abstention of the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the share of difficult cases and levels of ability among older people is also higher than among young people.
Mortality resulted in SARS above the case of COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is insensitive, while patients with SARS are usually infected only in difficult cases of illness, thus maintaining the distribution of COVID-19 difficulter than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spread much faster and greater than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal tests for the SARS-CoV-2 NCB.
On the other hand, healed patients may show the places of virus tests.
All of this increases the risk of the distribution of virus.
The COVID-19 studies in the background of such a quick movement remain some important issues, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of the 96 percent homologe between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like muscle coronaviruses, we can still not acknowledge that SARS-CoV-2 infection has occurred from the flying mouse.
What animal has been the intermediate type of virus translated from the original master, such as flying mouse to man?
Without knowledge of the answers to the first and second question, we cannot hopefully stop the way of transmission, and the epidemiological situation may be disturbed at any time.
Modeling at molecule level and biochemical tests demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 relates to ACE2, but how does the virus be introduced into the breathing pathological changes and produce the following pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with ACE2 cells in other bodies?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long is the epidemia?
How is the virus genetic evolution in the process of human transfer to humans?
Will he become the cause of world pandemia, disappear like SARS or periodically recycle such a grippe?
These are priorities, but there will be time to seek answers to these and many other issues.
However, we have no other choice, except whatever it is worth, to stop the epidemic as far as possible and to return to the normal life.
Zoon origin of coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation stimulated the coevolution of coronavirus (CoV) and their carriers, including people during the thousands of years.
Before 2003, two coronavirus (HCoV) causes easily disease such as normal prostitute.
The impressions of a heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our view of how disasterous and dangerous human coronavirus could be.
The appearance of the coronavirus of a heavy breathing syndrome of the second type (SARS-CoV-2) in the central China at the end of 2019 again brought attention to the coronavirus and surprised us by high transmission, but more expressed by the pathogenicity of this virus compared to the SARS-CoV family virus.
The coronaviral human infection is a zone, and the understanding of its zone origin will be a very significant.
Most human coronavirus occur from flying mouses for which they are not pathogenic.
There are also intermediate reservators of some coronavirus.
The designation of animals with an intense impact on the prevention of expansion of diseases.
A study of the interaction of animals, I'm the carriers of coronavirus, can also light on the patogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we bring the information on the seven coronaviruses, giving a major attention to the history of their discovery, as well as their zone origin and methods of interviously transfer.
It is important to note that we have a comparison and comparison of various coronavirus from the view of the virus evolution and genetic recombination.
In this context, the today’s disease epidemic resulted from the coronavirus discovered in 2019 (COVID-19).
Furthermore, the conditions for the successful change of the carriers are noted and the impact of the virus development on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviridae is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of vibrative viruses with one locally CNS poor.
These viruses with the largest among the NCB-containing viruses of geneome 26 to 32,000 nucleotides received a name through their form that reminds the crown when examining the electronic microscope.
From the point of view of the structure, the coronavirus contains genematic genes with the identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the geneome contain two largely openly open accounting frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteine.
These polyproteines are further processed to generate 16 nests of whites listed in nsp1~16.
The rest of the geneome contains open accounting frames for structured whites, including ship-vide white (S), white (E), membrane white (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
In other lines of coronavirus, a number of line-specific accessor whites has also been encoded.
The differences in the sequences of the coronavirus are divided by four types (alpha, beta, gamma and deltacoronavirus), including the majority of betacoronavirus and divided by four lines (A, B, C and D).
The philogenetic evidence of the fact that the majority of alpha and betacoronavirus I are flying mouse and grisen, while birds are the main reserve for gamma and deltacoronavirus.
During thousands of years, the coronavirus continued to overcome inter-video bariers, and some of them have evoluted to the dangerous human patogens.
Today there are seven coronaviruses.
Their numbers are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alphakoronavirus.
The rest of five betacoronavirus includes HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the coronavir of a severe heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the coronavir of a near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and the coronavirus of a severe heavy respiratory syndrome of the type SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause the symptoms of easy form, such as prostitution and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast with them, SARS-CoV viruses, MERS-CoV and recently detected SARS-CoV-2 extremely pathogenic cause severe infections in the lower respiratory pathways in comparatively greater number of patients with a higher probability of severe respiratory disease development (OCS) and emergency symptoms.
The first neck of HCoV-229E coronavir, B814, was obtained from the pattern of the nasoglote of patients who were sick in the 1960s.
With these extensive studies, more detailed knowledge of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses have been drawn up, which cause the symptoms of local infection.
In fact, before the emergency of a heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS) the generally accepted concept of the incidence of the coronavirus in general was considered unlikely.
In 2003, SARS was one of the most disaster epidemics in the present history; more than 8 000 people were sick, and the general indicator of employment was about 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the emergency of the near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to long epidemics on the Arab half island, and the disease was proportionally spread into the rest of the world.
The new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) found in 2019, which was later renamed to SARS-CoV-2, was a rebuilder of the current coronaviral infection epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which, on 3 March 2020, had increased more than 3 120 lives and the number of infected persons exceeded 91.000.
The food signal has been obtained, and the world must be prepared for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemia.
All seven coronavirs have a zone origin, their sources are flying mouse, mouse or home animals.
Many data sets are evident in the benefit of the evolutional nature of all muscle coronavirs from flying muscles, whose organs have been well adapted and in which they have no pathetic properties, but demonstrate a wide variety of genetics.
The COVID-19 epidemic has abandoned China and all the world a severe challenge from medical, scientific, and moral view.
The investigation of the Zoon Mechanism of Original Coronavirus will enable them to understand their natural history, which moves their evolutional forces and factors to intervival transmission.
It may also indicate or have the search for a reserve, intermediate and amplificing SARS-CoV-2 carrier, which is very important to prevent the re-proliferation of disease in the future.
This review contains general information on the zone origin, intervival transfer and pathogenesis of coronavirus.
In particular, we consider and consider the general characteristics: the original viruses from which the coronaviruses have occurred are usually not patogenic for their reserved carriers, but obtain patogenic character after transmission to the new carrier.
We also analyze the trend of the evolution of coronavirus, which often leads to the deterioration of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current incidence of SARS-CoV-2 is considered.
Animal coronaviruses are since the end of the 1930s.
Before the B814 virus of HCoV-229E was first obtained from the pattern of the patient's nosoglote, illness, disorder, different coronaviruses in different infected animals, including index, mouse, boats, sugars, kitchens and dogs.
Seven coronavirs have been detected in recent decades.
Table 1 insightive and supervisively presents a short history of discovery of cronological coronavirus.
The first stamp of HCoV-229E virus was obtained from the tests taken from the breathing paths of patients with infectious breathing roads in 1966; further this adjustment virus is multiplied in WI-38 cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have shown severe symptoms, including pain, disorder, general disturbance and pain in the neck, while high temperature and ≥ 10 to 20 per cent of cases were observed.
Later, in 1967, the HCOV-OC43 virus was from organic culture and the following series of muscle-mouse passports.
The clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection by HCoV-229E seem to be similar to the infections of HCoV-229E virus, which are unlikely to affect other respiratory pathogens, such as A influenza viruses and renovirus viruses.
And the HCoV-229E virus and HCoV-OC43 have a global spread in the world and are normally transferred in winter-time in measured widths.
The main incubation period of these two viruses is less than weeks, and there should be about two weeks of disease.
According to the results of volunteers' studies, healthy people infected by HCoV-229E have developed a normal light form prostitute.
Only in few patients with weak immunity, a severe infection of low breathing paths was shown.
The SARS-support, also as a "Atiopic Pneumonia epidemic", became the first of the history of the unity of a well-documentated pandemy caused by human coronavirus, and the disease-builder, the third of the detected coronavirus, became the SARS-CoV virus.
The first case of SARS illness was found at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guandon.
During the SARS epidemic, 8 096 cases of disease and 774 cases of death were documented, and the disease was spread in many countries and in different continents.
Without prejudice to the overall distributors, it was highlighted that each sick person could still infect about two people; the incubation period was from 4 to 7 days, and the viral burden pick was on the 10th weeks of disease.
In patients infected with SARS-CoV, pain in muscles, pains, high temperature, general deficiency and discontinuation, and among more severe symptoms there were a coverage, →el and respiratory insufficiency.
Extensions of laboratory indicators from the SARS are limphopenia, inflammation in pigment tests and increased creatininasis levels.
Patients with SARS are also observed by diffusional alveo damage, proliferation of hepatic cells and increased macrophage levels.
Approximately 20 to 30% of patients need intensive therapy and ventilation mechanism.
In such difficult cases, other bodies may also be infected, including the organs of iron-bottle, sands and pockets, which are usually led by a cytokine storm that can be awaitable, especially for patients with weak immunity.
The first virus was from the open biopsy of the sick family who came to Hong Kong from Guangjou.
With that lot, great efforts were made to investigate the coronavirus.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was in the netherlands' seven-month child.
Sna has been established that he is primarily affecting children of age, elderly and patients with weak immunity and respiratory diseases.
For the illness of HCoV-NL63, I are characteristics of demonstrations such as smuggling, conjunction, high temperature and bronchiolite.
Another independent investigation described the same virus of the nazi material taken by a 8-month boy from the Netherlands suffering of pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but actually it is distributed in total.
According to the estimates, HCoV-NL63 is a cause of approximately 4.7 per cent of broadly spread respiratory diseases, and the pick of the diseases they cause to start the summer, the weight and the winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with an efficient larringith, which is also called Cru.
HCoV-HKU1 was held in Hong Kong in that same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolite.
Furthermore, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with asthmatic diseases.
As HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, which causes light form respiratory diseases, have been detected worldwide.
All these four human coronavirs that cause infections in the hospital were well adjusted to people, and their mutation, which normally leads to high pathogenic diseases, is not likely, even though the incidents were not like the rare example of a more virusic undertaking HCoV-NL63, which, in recent reports, caused a serious infection of the underlying pathways in China.
Normally, having the ability to deliver and maintain in human body effectively, these coronavirus become less viral or pathogenic.
The coronavirus of the near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a 60-year-old patient with an insufficiency and an initial insufficiency.
Most of the laboratory had occurred in the Middle East, but in various countries of Peece and Tunisia, transport accidents and distribution were registered through episodic secondary cases of infection in close contacts.
Another secondary emergency of 186 cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestation of the near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) reminds the symptoms of a severe heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS) — that is, for both infections, a characteristic advancement of a heavy nerve.
Despite the SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed a strong initial failure that MERS has to be declined from the other diseases caused by coronaviruses that are transmitted to a person.
More than 30 per cent of patients are noted in iron-bottle symptoms, such as diarrhoea and fluid.
At the time of 14 February 2020, more than 2.500 laboratories were registered in cases of a high-level respiratory syndrome (34.4 per cent), and MERS-CoV is therefore considered one of the most crucial viruses of humans.
During the middle to the end of December 2019 in Uhana of the Chinese province of Hubai, there have been detections of Pneumonia patients, which now, in view of the past, are related to the infection caused by the coronavirus of a heavy respiratory syndrome of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health has declared that the continuing infection of the below breathes caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global emergency situation in the field of public health, and the same disease has been called “coronaviral infection 19” (COVID-19).
On 3 March 2020, 90 053 have been registered in the world, and there is approximately 3.4 per cent.
It should be noted that the ≥ 4,2 per cent in the Chinese province of Hubai is 4,2 per cent and at its level is 1,2 per cent.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronavirus, causes a severe respiratory infection that is characterised by a higher temperature, a temperature and a wave.
Some patients also observe diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most heavy symptoms and is able to quickly go to the syndrome of respiratory insufficiency.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, taking into account the high gambling of nucleotic follow-ups (82 per cent), these virus, however, constitute different fruits of the philogenet of the tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less patogenic, but has greater capacity to transfer compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There are recorded cases of an unsynthetic infection of SARS-CoV-2, which testify that this virus is able to spread rapidly throughout the world.
As a result of the comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other coronaviruses, significant comparisons and differences are shown.
Firstly, the human transmission of coronaviruses has a similar incubation period and the duration of the fluctuation of their diseases.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the rest of six coronavirs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four coronaviruses that cause infections in the hospital (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the infections of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to the most often observed by coronaviruses that cause extra-social infections, including non-specific evidence, symptoms, or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, as in the SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of difficult cases of COVID-19 can be identified, although the relationship is a little below.
Thirdly, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 also notes interesting legislation characteristics for coronavirs that cause hospital infections and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is, at least, the same high as in the coronavirs that cause nervous infections.
On the other hand, it is still necessary to check whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is decreased with each following transition of virus (e.g. by infection of each person), such as in cases SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as well as other coronaviruses that cause nervous infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the models of the coal.
We must also answer the question whether the fair or oral way to transfer SARS-CoV-2 is the same significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
A particular interest is also addressed to the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 seasonality characterised for coronavirs that cause infections in the hospital.
However, the future development of COVID-19 will depend on the SARRS-CoV-2 features, including transmission, pathogenicity and sustainable distribution after human transition.
All four coronavirs, which caused hospital infections with the symptoms of easily form, were well adapted to people.
On the other hand, these people may have been well adapted to these four coronaviruses.
In other words, those and others could be called the only successors of the past crownvirus pandemies.
Human coronaviruses that cause severe human diseases, and people whose coronaviruses cause severe diseases have simply not survived.
To this end, coronaviruses should be replied in the body in sufficient way to compile adaptive mutations against the factors of the carrier.
In this sense, more than longer the SARS-CoV-2 and more people will be infected, more the possibility that the virus is completely adapted to humans.
If he is well adapted, his transfer among humans will be difficult to stop with the control of infectional diseases or other activities.
During many years among the population, four non-hospital coronavirs have been circled by people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require animal reservation.
High-pathogene coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been sufficiently adjusted to a person, and their transfers among people cannot be supported.
They need to be maintained and multiplied in their zone reserves and seeking cases of improving mixtures, possibly through one or several intermediate or strengthening carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has snippets similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV non-hospital viruses.
It is very easily translated as a nervous HCoV at least currently.
But he's more pathogen than HCoV, and less pathogen than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
See if it is completely adapted to a person and whether it will be circulated in the environment without a reserve or with an intermediate animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, we will discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolution, natural, intermediate, enhanced and reserved HCoV virus carriers.
The livestock serves as the HCoV evolutional carrier if it transfers a neighborhood forefather from the same high homoology at the level of nuclear sequences.
Previous virus is usually well adapted and unpatogenically in this weapon.
In the proper way, the reserve carrier continues to carry HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, wearers are naturally infected and I are being subject to natural HCoV carriers or his parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only carried into a temporary carrier directly before or about the time he was brought to a person, he was not well adapted to the new carrier and often pathogenically.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zone source of infection and play the role of enhanced carrier, allowing the virus to replicate, and then delivering it to people, strengthening the human infection.
HCoV may transfer stupid infection if it is not able to maintain the transfer inside the intermediate mediator.
Instead, HCoV viruses can also be adapted to the intermediate driver and even have a long endemic.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reserve carrier.
Epidemiological data retro showed that the SARS-nual patient had anamnezly contacted the industrial animals (child).
Following seroprevalence studies showed that the IgG-Ig-CoV-virus spread is higher than the total population.
The Himalaian civitates (Paguma larvata) and the enotic dog on the markets of living animals were the first placed virus carriers, similar to and almost identical SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly under the fact that after all the citizens on the markets, the SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalian civitas in nature or in farms and not in the markets did not determine in most cases SARS-CoV that allowed them to conclude that the Himalaian citizens could serve only as a intermediate enhanced carrier and not a natural SARS-CoV reserve.
It is noted that, since 80 per cent of the different animals in the Guangjou markets have an anticipation to SARS-CoV, it is likely to exclude the probability that intermediate enhanced carriers can also serve many kinds of small milk.
They all seem to be stupid SARS-CoV virus carriers.
The following search for a natural animal carrier SARS-CoV detected a neighboring CoV flying mouse, which was called the athical pneumonia coronavirus of HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese sub-scale muscles.
These muscles are antent to SARS-CoV and the genoconsequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other muscle-flying coronaviruses have 88-92% of the same gambling of nucleotides as SARS-CoV.
These studies found the foundation of the new concept that the flying mouse was the carrier of new pathogens.
A number of SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) was also found in the flying mouse, but none of them except one that means WIV1, isolated as a living virus.
It is known that SARS-CoV is an angiotensin-converting farm 2 (ACE2) receptor.
It was shown that WIV1, obtained from the fical muscle test, uses ACE2 flying muscles, cyvets and humans as a receptor for incoming in the cell.
Interestingly, healing patients with SARS could neutralize WIV.
Today, WIV1 represents the closest SARS-CoV family father in the flying mouse, dividing 95% of the nucleotic follow-up homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, WIV1 is generally not a direct parental virus SARS-CoV, but a flying mouse is not a direct SARS-CoV reserve mediator.
The philogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV will include the same group as CoV-HKU4 flying mouse and CoV-HKU5 flying mouse.
CoV-HKU4 flying mouse and MERS-CoV are using the same carrier receptor, dipeptildipeptidase-4 (DPP4) for viruses.
The follow-up of the NCR depending on the MERS-CoV virus phylogeneticly closer to the follow-ups of the betacoronavirus flying muscles found in and.
To this end, wild flying mouse is not on the live MERS-CoV virus.
The nucleotic follow-up homology of MERS-CoV and its nearest family CoV-HKU25 flying mouse is only 87 per cent.
That is, the flying mouse could not be the direct reserve weapon of MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, research on the Middle East showed that one Arabic sheets are sero-positive to neutralizing anticipants specific for MERS-CoV, as well as the sheets of near-east origin in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, the identical virus found in humans, was from the narrow bottles of one-cove wheels, which even more confirms the role of the wheels as the real reserve carriers MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that the bullets, experimentally infected MERS-CoV, have been observed as few symptoms but massive virusality.
It is noted that infected wheels had a virus not only by a respiratory way but also by a fax oral way, which is also the main way of the virus in the flying mouse.
However, there are still questions, since many cases of a near-east respiratory syndrome have not been in anamnezed contact with the wheels before symptoms occurred and probably refer to human transfers or transfers to non-east channels, including unsettled animal species which I am holding by MERS-CoV carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide homology coincides with CoV RaTG13 flying muscles in the Asian Rhinolophus finis subcountries.
Like in cases SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign parents to them.
That is, the flying mouse could not be a direct reserved SARS-CoV-2 carrier if only in the future there are almost identical muscle coronaviruses.
Previously, the direct animals of SARS-CoV-2 virus must be among wild species sold and deadly on the ocean oil market, with many initial cases of COVID-19, which testifies the possibility of transfer from animals.
Several recent studies based on metagenomous sequence concluded that a group of small milk-coated groups, such as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also transfer parent betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
The follow-up homology of the nuclears of these new pangoline coronavirus is 85-92% corresponding to SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also close to RaTG13, and the identity of nuclear reactions is about 90 per cent.
They are classified in two areas of virus differences like SARS-CoV-2, in a wood philogenet, one of which is closer to SARS-CoV-2 with a 97.4% aminocyl.
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more different, despite a higher level of follow-up homology at all genetic levels.
In the early survey of pangolines, there was also a report on the definition of virus counties in tests that were similarly relatives with SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of collection and manual treatment were applied to obtain the results of the gene, including approximately 86.3% of the fully-dimensional virus geneome.
Without prejudice to the possibility that pangoline is one of the intermediate animals SARS-CoV-2.
However, because of the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus of pangolines, the SARS-CoV-2 family, there are no evidence currently in support of the direct origin of the SARS-CoV-2 from the pangoline.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is still smaller than between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses of pangolines with SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolution path has not yet been established in flying muscles, pangolines and other milkwaters.
While the highest follow-up homology was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus of pangolines, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are the highest follow-up homologies within the entire gene.
Very theoretically, high comparison between the betacoronaviruses of pangolines, SARS-CoV-2 families and SARS-CoV-2 with parallel evolution through selectiveness.
The opposite proposal is a recombine between the betacoronavirus of pangolines, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As a mobile power of evolution, the recombination is widely distributed among betacoronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zone origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU viruses are also studied in the area of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU.
Philogenetic evidence of the fact that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can occur from the muscle coronavirus while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found in grass.
It was reported that the coronavirus of flying muscles called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Riʹ CoV) and found by the North American three-color adsorptionist demonstrates a close family with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E geneticly with another crown-virus flying mouse called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although it was suspicious that its intermediate carrier could also be able.
In order to clarify modern knowledge of animal origin of coronavirus, figure 1 and Table 2.
Philogenetic analysis is evidence of the occurrence of the interviously transmission of HCoV in anamnesis.
When about 1890 the intermediate transfer of HCoV-OC43 virus and people were infected by domestic animals, a respiratory infection pandemia was registered.
The history of the interview transfer of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Alphakoronaviruses were found by flying mouse, nearby-general HCoV-229E.
There is an alphakoronavirus among them.
The data support the rapid transmission of virus from a flying person.
Firstly, people, not alphacs, could contact flight mouse in the general environmental neck.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alphacs.
Secondly, alphakoronaviruses, HCoV-229E families, are different and unpatogenic in flying muscles, while alphakoronavirus caused the admission to respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alphakoronavirus was not found in wild animals.
Thus, excluding the probability that the alphacs were obtained from humans, HCoV-229E.
In fact, the flying mouse I is a primary source of human patogenic viruses, including the virus of the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that flying mouses could have been stretched to transfer people from HCoV-229E.
On the other hand, while the alphakoronavirus of flying muscles could serve a genetic pull of HCoV-229E, the alpacs and single arbs could be intermediate mediators before human virus, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV serves as an example of interviously transmission from a flying mouse to one-arb wheel and from a single-arb wheel to a man.
The evolution of MERS-CoV virus from the flying mouse is on its original identity and was then undergoing follow-up studies.
It is obvious that flying muscles give a wealthy pull of viruss for intervisible exchange of gene fractions and intervival transfers.
Long-term, humble populations, close interactions and ability to fly makes the flying mouse "perfect spreaders".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to the one-arb worms for decades ago.
It is a good adjustment to these wheels that have been converted from the intermediate carrier to a stable and natural reserve carrier.
The MERS-CoV virus causes very easily disease and is characterised by low mutation frequency.
His episode transmission to the person is a accident, and a person remains a stupid MERS-CoV carrier, since his transfer is not supported.
Despite the role of the wheels in the MERS-CoV transfer, the role of pangolines, if such, in the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 other.
In particular, betacoronaviruses of pangolines are highly pathogenic in pangolines.
They may be a stupid betacoronavirus carriers, SARS-CoV-2 families, as well as citizens in the case of SARS-CoV.
The future studies should confirm or disable a few of the inter-video transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals.
First, flying mouse can be a reserve carrier for a virus, SARS-CoV-2 family, nearly identical SARS-CoV-2.
People can divide the environmental knife with the flying mouse by taking a view of or dividing the sticks of these animals.
Second, pangolines may be one of the intermediate enhanced loaders in which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently fallen.
Humans are affected by a tush-section and the use of wild animals' meat.
It is possible that many animals, including households, are comprehensive to SARS-CoV-2.
The investigation of domestic and wild animals on anticipation is justified.
Thirdly, as specified above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in the third way, which was contacted with flight mouse and pangolines.
The search for animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is continued.
Furthermore, three main factors from virus also contributed to crossing inter-video bariers.
First of all, they are highly mutated in the CNR replication.
In comparison with other viruses with a single-handed NCB, the estimated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered "dead-height" with average replacement of approximately 10 to 4 replacements per year at one part of 2 depending on the stage of the adjustment of coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have an adjusting exorbibonuclease, which leads to extremely high mutation and weakness frequency or even inviolence.
Interestingly, the Nucleotic Remdesivir analogue presses the replication of coronavirus through the inhibition of this exorbibuclease and the CNR dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising instruments against SARS-CoV-2, which must be checked in the course of clinical studies.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is nearly million times higher than their wearers.
Moreover, the rate of mutation may often be even higher if the coronavirus is not sufficiently correctly adapted to the carrier.
In comparison with SARS-CoV with high mutation, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation frequency is evident below that it is a higher level of adaptation to people.
This virus has already been adapted to another carrier close to a person.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this will also take place to MERS-CoV, well adjusted to one-arb bottles.
Theoretically, it is not likely that vaccines and antiviral medicines from SARS-CoV-2 to quickly lose efficiency as a result of the draft genet.
Secondly, the major RNA gene in coronavirus leads to greater plastic in the genetic mode of mutation and recombination and thus increases the probability of inter-video-evolution that is favorable to develop new coronavirus in the presence of relevant coronavirus.
This contributes to numerous unity of open accounting and white functions encoded in the 3′ end of the gene.
Thirdly, by means of the unique mechanism of the selection of matrice, the coronavirus is a case and often changes the matrix during the replication of the CNR.
During the transcription of DNA coronavirus in a mediator, a mixed vessel often occurs.
High-monological and subgenomous NCBs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animal coronavirus, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 flying mouse.
Interaction with virus-based transmission
In addition to the above three virus factors, another key factor that is important for interviously transfer is the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor.
In this article as a typical example, which also demonstrates the evidence of the selection of interview events, the SARS-CoV recommended.
Based on a comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV and citizens, SARS-CoV is considered to take place a rapid adjustment in different loaders, especially that mutations on the RSD are cased with SHD.
In general, the RSD was S coronavirus is interacting with the cell recipient, and the response of the carrier anticipate is intensely selecting it.
SARS-CoV is an aminosilote, from 318 to 510 in the S1 flag, which is linked to an angiotensin transforming pharmaceutical 2 (APF2) humans and its corepters.
SARS-CoV virus RSD is able to recognize APF2 different animal receptors, including muscles, cybers, mouse and enotic dogs, making inter-video transmission.
In fact, only 6 aminosil residues were found in the RSD, distinguished from human and citizens, and 4 of them were found in a receptor-related motive for interaction with the APF2 recipient.
SARS-CoV citizens have mutations of K479N and S487T in the RSD, which may increase the interaction of a ship-video with the ABF2 receptor.
In other words, these two replacements of aminosis may be important to adapt virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell recipient as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in Segment S1 was 30% of S resulted in the possibility of changing the relevant efficiency of S to the APF2.
In fact, the survey with the microscope of the crioelectric microscope states that the efficiency of this connection is 10-20 times higher than between human APF2 and SARS-CoV virus S.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other correctors need to be transferred to SARS-CoV-2.
It is amazing that HCoV-NL63 is also related to APF2, but with the other section was S.
There are many other HCoV recipients such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetil acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in humans after intervival transfer from animals.
In addition to cell recipients, the result of the intermediate transfer of HCoV is also managed by other factors of dependence and employment of the carrier.
The divergence of these white whites between humans and natural reserves of HCoVs, such as flying mouse, single Arab wheels and grass, may be a barrier for interviously transfer.
For a successful inter-video transfer to HCoV viruses, the factors of dependency and the factors of the restriction of the carrier must be sustained.
In this regard, determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and classified.
Good results can lead to an unprecedented totally genuine distortion of the factors of dependency and restriction of carriers for SARS-CoV-2 using the newest CRISPR technology.
Expiration of new HCoV: back to zero mark
The diversity of muscle-flying coronavirus creates wide opportunities for new HCoVs.
In this regard, the coronavirus of flying mouse serves as a genetic pull for HCoV.
Furthermore, the rapid mutation and genetic recombination is also a movement of HCoV evolution and serves two important steps in this process.
For example, the recovery or loss of new genes, coding whites, has a potential for radical mode of virus phenotypes.
The SARS-CoV accessor whites are considered ORF8, since the ORF8 flight mouse virus, SARS-CoV family, were isolated, but it is established that they encode ORF8 different whites.
A 29-nucleotide department characterized for SARS-CoV coronavirus was found in the stamps isolated at the beginning of the epidemic.
This delegation divides ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that has a change in the carrier.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has a story of recombinations with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, where the CNR dependent polymerase had a large number of smaller recombinant parts.
Recombinations were also defined in nsp9, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
The Epidemic MERS-CoV has been demonstrated properly undergoing recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in one-arbian wheels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recurrent events were also observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs were recombined with other animal coronavirus in their nest genes.
It is also necessary to warn that the experimental selection can contribute to unpredicted changes in virus genes, which, mostly, results from the release of virus from selective pressures, for example from the immune system of the carrier.
The example of these effects is the loss of ORF4 full-dimensional in the HCoV-229E prototype through the delegation of two-cloroid.
While an intact open ORF4 accounting framework can be observed in the muscle and wheel viruss of HCoV-229E families, the alphakoronavirus demonstrates a single nucleotic insertion that leads to the movement of the frame.
Finally, the development of new HCoVs has also been emphasized by the pressure of the selection on their reserve carriers.
When the muscles were infected by the coronavirus, the symptoms expressed or their absence were registered, as it states of mutual adjustment between the coronavirus and the flying mouse.
Anatomically and physiologically flying mouses were well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, the defects of the activation of the response in the flying mouse effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
Furthermore, natural activity of murder cells in a flying mouse has been pressed by the adjustment of the NKG2/CD94 natural inhibitor inhibitors and the low level of expression of the molecules of class I's primary gas compatibility.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen forms, which provides a high metabolic of fluid mouse activity, can decrease the coronavirus replication, at the same time affecting the calculation of exoribnuclease, thus creating the pressure of the selection to generate virus stamps that are highly pathogeneous in the new carrier.
More pathogenic coronavirus patterns may also develop by recombination, which leads to the obtaining of new whites or properties to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is not accidentally that three new human coronavirus have occurred in the last twenty years.
Coronaviruses are not patogenic or are caused by the symptoms of their reserved carriers, such as flying mouse or wheel.
They are probably replied without a strong immune response to the carrier.
This is a secret of why we see unsensitive wearers, and which causes severe infection.
Difficult symptoms are mainly the hyper-hiper-reaction and cytokinestorm, where immune reactions are more seriously affected by the population.
In contrast, the immune response is not associated with the replication of the coronavirus.
At the same time, immune reactions may have positive effects on therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
The flight mouse has a particularly strong interferon response.
The adoption of type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, should have a favourable effect.
Moreover, the NLRP3-inflamasome activation has been violated in the flying mouse.
The inhibition of NLRP3-inflamasome with MCC950 may result in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 extinction should be a general scheme for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the betacoronavirus of flying mouse was found, the nucleotic homology of 95 per cent corresponds to SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavir of flying mouse, which is 96 per cent of the SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was found that civilians and other market animals were transferring viruses, the same SARS-CoVs were not directly established.
Betacoronaviruses of pangoline, extremely homosexual SARS-CoV-2, which states that pangolines could serve one of the intermediate carriers or that the fragments of betacoronavirus pangolins could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining issues, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by a person or randomly.
Coronaviruses have been attached to themselves because of the recent incidence of SARS-CoV-2.
The investigation of coronavirs in the flying mouse and other animals has radically changed our understanding of the importance of the zone origin and the HCoV reserve in the transfer.
Convince that the evidence of the performance showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were occurred from flying mouse and were transmitted to the person through intermediate carriers.
If the SARS-CoV infection occurs from contact between people and market civilians, the closure of the markets and civilization could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
In the light of the opening of different lines of betacoronavirus pangolines, SARS-CoV-2 nearby, to prevent the transfer of zone infections from product markets, the pangolines should be removed.
However, if the SARS-CoV-2 person is transferred through pangolines and other milkwaters, and how this can remain the tasks of future investigations.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long been held in one-arb wheels.
These sheets serve as a major vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and fat products for the population.
They are widely spread in the Middle East and in the middle.
Therefore, it is not possible to put all beams in order to control MERS, as it was made on the wild animal markets of China to prevent the distribution of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the periodic effort of MERS, a comprehensive approach must be taken to enhance the effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for steel in accordance with other infection control measures.
Since we can't remove these viruses, new genetic genetics may occur.
In the world, various zone coronaviruses are circulated.
In particular, the coronavirus of the flying mouse with the area potential is extremely different.
There is a huge role in evolution and recombination of these zone coronavirus, which will bring to the future new coronaviruses, which are more transmitted and/or more abilities for humans.
In order to reduce the number of excessive contacts between humans and animals, it should be rejected from the culture of consumption of wild animals in some areas of China.
After severe trials of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, the best preparation and plan of reaction to such situations are.
In fact, many viruses are on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservations until there is a possibility of capture of new territory.
Although many flighting muscle properties are favorable to spread viruses, learning people to keep them on the side, we can minimize the probability of human contact with flight mouse and other species of wild animals.
For better understanding the environment of coronavirs and their natural carriers, the continuous epidemiological monitoring of milk-pirates will be useful to prevent the transfer of coronavirus from animals and future diseases.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent the virus of zoos is to keep people far away from the environmental nests of the natural reserve of zone viruses.
There are still some fragments in the area of the SARS-CoV-2 origin.
First of all, if flying muscles have been transmitted to the pangolians, it is interesting to see in which circumstances the flying mouse and pangolines divide the same environmental noise.
Second, if flying mouse plays a more direct role in the transmission of the person, it is necessary to determine how people have contacted the flying mouse.
Thirdly, if the role of the true intermediate carrier plays the third milk, it is necessary to find out how it works with different types, including humans, flying mouse and pangolines.
Finally, since many milk, including domestic animals, may be eligible for SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
If it is a flying mouse, pangolin or another milkwater, it is expected that in the future the SARS-CoV-2 or its foreheads will be defined by their natural carriers.
Further studies in this area will light on the SARS-CoV-2 development path in animals, which will have significant effects on the profile and control of COVID-19 in humans.
diagnostic criteria needed to be updated for "consequences of disease suspicion" and "subsequent cases" COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group onop held a brief guide for diagnosis and treatment of the new coronaviral infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on the diagnosis and recommendations on the fight against this pandemia worldwide.
However, the coronaviral infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have increased gradually on the basis of the current results of research and experience; thus diagnostic and therapeutic pharmacovigilance have also been continually updated.
In this letter, we answered one comment and introduced the newest diagnostic criteria for “consequences of disease suspect” and “under cases” in the document “Diagnosis and therapy recommendations for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which now received the official name of the Coronavirus Infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus illness only was called “the heavy respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO was COVID-19 as a pandemia.
In order to combat the infection of SARS-CoV-2, our group repeated a short-term guide and repeated it on the website of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This was a great attention.
Let us note that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of the current results of the experience and experience; thus diagnostic and therapeutic pharmacokinetics have also been continuously updated.
For example, in the period from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven issues of the diagnostic and therapy recommendations for the COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), and the content of certain of its positions have been changed.
The recently prepared Jou (Zhou) with the co-operators had been made comments on our recommendations, which contained simple diagnostic proposals which had already been diagnosed.
This work has added new practical witnesses to our recommendations, as well as a valuable basic information on this pandemia that covered the whole world.
We confirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, the last issue of the diagnostic and therapy recommendations for COVID-19 (seventh version) and the results of current studies, and their work is needed to be updated.
In the seventh issue of this document (from 3 March 2020) for a comprehensive analysis in the case of suspicion of disease, one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical diseases should be united:
Epidemiological history: (1) The history of previews or places in Mr. Uhan and its surroundings or in other population items, where cases of COVID-19 have been registered for 14 days before showing symptoms; (2) the history of contacts with diseases infected by SARS-CoV-2 (local tests based on nuclear acid); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Mr. Uhan and its circuit or other populations, where COVID-19 has been registered during the last 14 days before the presentation of symptoms; (4) the history of contacting with groups of persons with underlying diseases (≥ 2 cases, characteristics of COVID-19 in the cases of the diseases, or in the other places).
Clinical manifestations: (1) High temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) the presence of external evidence of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leucocytes is normal or decreased with a decreased number of limfocytes at the early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for the diagnosis in the case of illness should be based on the suspicion of one of the pathogenic or serological evidence points, namely: (1) the PCR test in real time is local for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-generated sequence of virus shows high homogenity of new coronavirus; (3) the results of the serotest for specific IgM and IgG SARS-CoV-2 antivirus; or the change of the test result from negatively positive for the specify of the SARS-CoV-2 anticipation of IgG; or the increase of the titra less than 4 times in the phase of the sample-compliant test indicator.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) issues of the document were added to the CCP tests in real time for nuclear acid in breathing paths or blood tests.
The pathogenic blood test diagnosis was added on the fourth (27 January 2020) and on the fifth (8 February 2020) issues, and then the seventh issue was added to serial evidence.
These changes are on the results of the continuous work of researchers, seeking an optimal set of nuclear acid detection at the fast diagnosis and analysis of the tests resulting from breathing paths, including the selection of blood tests, which increases the accessibility of various samples and enables local test results for specific antidepreciation in the illness criteria.
However, more evidence is needed to be careful when treating patients with athical symptom and patients without expressed symptoms.
Thus, the road card presented in Jou (Zhou) and Dr. should be updated, since it has no clinical symptoms classified as a ‘low risk’ group.
The system also requires accuracy in conducting a further clone of research and research.
We will conclude that we hope to obtain more urgent evidence and invite readers to leave their comments.
In the diagnosis of "consequences of suspects" and "under the cases", we will allow readers to follow and perform the last recommendations given in countries where they live.
Our group will also take time to update its recommendations in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new cases in the result of COVID-19 - daily ma
Bangladesh yesterday confirmed five new cases as a result of COVID-19 per day.
It's the biggest number of virus per day.
In the event of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute reported that 114 cases of infection were registered, as well as 33 health aspects of home patients.
It was registered by 17.
On-line, IEDCR director Dr. Mirdjabi Sabrina Flora races that four men and one woman were victims.
Dr. Mirdjabi said that two ended age of 60 years, two of 51 to 60 years of age, and one of 41 to 50 years.
She also reported that two dead were from Dakka.
On 11 March, World Health Protection (WHO) announced the COVID-19 Pandemy.
The clinical partner reported to the Anadol News Agency that one of the dead was Jall Siphur Rahman, director of the Bengalian Anticorruption Commission in the Kuwait clinice of Matrix.
On Saturday, on the Internet video discovery of the Minister for Car Transport and Bangladesh Powers, Obadel Quader stated that the work of public transport would be stopped for a longer time than the plan was originally before the Sabbath.
The work of public transport was stopped since 26 March and was to be renewed on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of goods in the first need — medicines, fuel and food products is still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were registered in Bangladesh on 8 March in two who returned from Italy, as well as in the wife of one of them.
On 19 March, these three people have already been healed.
SARS-CoV-2 overseer has a million of infection cases worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total number of cases of coronaviral infection by SARS-CoV-2 overall over the world.
COVID-19 of the coronavirus was at least 52,000 people.
Ruby held the same day when Malawi was in the first case of infection, and the first case of death from coronavir was established in Zambia.
Northern Korea claimed that it was one of the few countries in which the infection of coronaviral infection was not established on Thursday.
In the event of yesterday, World Health has reported about 1 051 635 in cases of infection, including 79 332 cases for twenty-four hours before 10:00 at the central time (0800 UTC) 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244.000 cases of infection by coronavirus were registered, of which at least 5.900 had an annual outcome.
CBS News with data on the Johns Hopkins University reported that in the United States, more than 1000 × resulting from coronaviral infections were established in the middle of the United States.
The countries worldwide announced the advancement of measures to prevent the dissemination of disease.
On Thursday, Mr. Moscow Sergei Sobiain extended the status of citizens' self-isolation until 1 May.
Previous President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians throughout the country, despite self-isolation, would be taken to 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted for the prolongation of the emergency position for 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes for, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended a commanding hour in the sanctuary cities of Mekka and Medina for full day, while the earlier commanding hour was only from 3 hours to 6 hours.
Thailand's plan is to introduce a commanding hour from 10 hours to 4 morning.
The Governor of the State of Ohio, Mike Dewain, announced that the regime of domestic self-isolation in the State territory was extended by order until 1 May.
The magazines in Australia include the number of toilet paper packages that can be obtained once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian magazines of Wool and Coles decreased the number of toilet paper packages that could be obtained once in all the country stores, to two and one packaging respectively.
ALDI also made a package on Monday.
These reports were reported in cases and on Facebook web pages.
As reported, the citizens began to make extreme resources because of the assurance that COVID-19 could be able to introduce a general self-isolation regime.
In the middle of the Wool's network, there was also a number of buyed toilet papers before one packaging.
Before, 4 and 5 March respectively, Wool and Coles have already packed this number of 4 packagings.
In its press relief of 8 March, the Coles network reported that with the introduction of four packages, “in many toilet papers, the redemption was still too fast for a hour” and called such a question as “unprecedented” while ALDI in Facebook post, on Tuesday, called such a “unexpected”.
According to Wool’s representative, the last week was observed a rare sale growth.
The magazine Costco in Canberra also held this number of two packagings last week.
In order to carry out the deficit, Coles began to order the suppliers a larger party and increased the frequency of supply, Wool’ths supplemented the party, while ALDI made reserves for the special operation of early sales in the middle.
Russell Zimmerman, the Executive Director of the Australian Association of Employments, reported that riders are trying to fill the stocks, but this is tomorrow with regard to the employment of the authorities in relation to the distribution of wage cars.
He expects the increase in self-security of the product, since the suppliers are trying to satisfy the question, but there are less beneficial proposals available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some magazines could not carry out environmental actions due to the deterioration of stocks.
In the News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a diversity trade expert from the Queensland Technology University, reported that magazines are filled with stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper is a gross goods, so the number of stock stocks is small, and after the total sale of the whole product, long numbers of poles remain empty, strengthening the deficiency of stocks.
“Coles and Wool’ths believe that if the pools were able to be filled, and goods such as the rounds of the toilet paper and hand dezinfiring means could be placed in large numbers, the buyers would probably not be paniced,” says Russell Cimerman.
In the past, the manufacturer of the train paper, who Gives a Crap, reported the storage.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Toilet paper manufacturer Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing the marking products of Sorbent, reported that they work about to ensure sufficient quantity of goods.
Domain.com, the sale site for unnecessary movement, reported that when the number of accommodations in Melbourne was decreased because of the lack of buyers on the week of work Day, some unnecessary sellers began to repeat the first parts of the auction free toilet paper.
The fourth issue of the NT News each day printed in Darwin included a tab from eight pages intended to cut and use as a toilet paper.
According to the ABC report of 3 March, the magazines have not been introduced to the number of goods obtained, claiming that they are not planned to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also used by a higher question, including medical masks, dezinfecting means for hands, gallerie, brake and muck.
In addition to the events in Australia, on Sunday evening, the British Supermarket Ocado's online magazine was also sold by Andres' toilet paper with 12 rolls.
World Health Declares the COVID-19 Pandemy
In the middle of the World Health Protection (WHO), the COVID-19 infection pandemia caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been announced.
Although the term “pandemic” is only the amount of disease, not the risk of specific cases, the WHO notes that the Governments of the countries need to take measures:
“All countries are still able to affect the development of the pandemia.”
This is possible if the countries are undertaken by detection, testing, treatment, isolation of illness, monitoring of disease and mobilization of their citizens,” explained Mr. Tedros Addan Gabeisus, the Director-General of the WHO.
“We are deeply concerned about the threatening level of dissemination and severity of disease and anxiety of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Friden, the former Officer of the United States Centres for Control and Profile of Disasters, the Pandemia is “unprecedented”.
In his interview translated by the CNN in February, he said that “no other respiratory virus other than the grip has been followed from the time of its arrival to the continuous global distribution”.
Mr. Gabrisus expressed an analogue point of view, saying, "We have never observed the pandemies caused by the coronavirus.
We have never seen a pandemia that can be controlled.’
In January, the WHO announced that the emergency situation in the field of public health, which had international importance, had a new status of pandemia.
The Director of the National University of Allergy and Infections of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said: "This is only the beginning, it will be worse."
According to the present Press on Thursday in the world, at least 126 000 cases of COVID-19 have been registered, and more than 4 600 people have ended.
Coronavirus pandemia 2019 to 2020 is currently placed in 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the coronavirus of a severe respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The emergency was found in Uhana, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020 the emergency situation of international importance in the field of public health, which was then recognised by the Pandemie on 11 March 2020.
On 10 April 2020, 210 countries and regions were registered approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19, which caused some 97.000 people to die.
Approximately 364 000 people have been healed.
The level of capacity in China consists of 4 per cent while it varies from 13,04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most exposed symptoms include disorder, elder, and difficult breathing.
Complications are related to pneumonia and an intense respiratory distress-syndrome.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the sickness is usually about five days, but it may also be different from two to fourteen days.
The treatment of vaccine or specifics has not been found at present.
Basic treatment has a symptomatic and sustainable character, and recommended predictive measures include the mixing of hands, the covering of mouths, the monitoring of distances between people, the detection and self-isolation of people who are suspicious of their infection.
Government throughout the world reacts to the situation by introducing forests, karantine measures, commanding hours, control of risks in slavery places and closing various objects.
Pandemia has led to serious global economic consequences, transfer or cancellation of religious, political and cultural activities, as well as to a widespread deficiency of goods depreciated by panical purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at national or regional levels in 193 countries, which affected approximately 99.4% of the worldwide students.
On the Internet, the dezinography of virus, xenophobia and discrimination occurred against the citizens of China, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people who remind them outside, and other groups of people in the areas where the importance of the dissemination of virus is indicated.
As a result of the reduction of the quantity of poetry and the closure of severe industrial undertakings, the level of air pollution and emissions was decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health of the city of Uhan (100% of the province of Hubai), China reported the emergency of the cases with no reason, and at the beginning of January 2020, an investigation of the situation was initiated.
The cases of infection were mainly with the optical market of Juanan products, so the virus, as they think, has a zone origin.
The virus that caused the disease is like SARS-CoV-2. This is a recently open virus with a large comparison to the muscle coronavirus, pangoline and SARS-CoV coronavirus. Later, the first case of illness occurred on 1 December 2019, and the infected has not visited the market after that date.
Two third cases of infection registered in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, the report Morning Post, which was not checked, suggested that the first case of infection had occurred with the 55-year-old Hubai province on 17 November 2019. 26 February 2020 the WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had been decreased but was unexpectedly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infection cases in the areas of China first overwhelmed the number of new infection cases in China.
The number of cases of disease may be strictly decreased, in particular because of cases with symptoms expressed.
In February 26, a few cases of infection among youths were registered, including patients with less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. The United Kingdom General Scientific Adviser Patrick Wallace underlined that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until the establishment of an effective group immunity in the country.
Statistics include the cases of infections of persons checked on COVID-19, and the test was made locally official protocols.
On 23 March, no country was able to check more than 3% of its population, and in many countries such as Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, an official policy was adopted that intends not to test on only small symptoms.
The 16 March studies showed that 86% of COVID-19 infections were not found in China until 23 January, and that such unregistered infections became a source of 79% of registered cases.
The statistical analysis on 30 March showed that the number of cases of infection in Italy had exceeded significantly the number of cases registered.
The first night of the basic reproductive number of infections (R0) by COVID-19 consisted from 1.4 to 2.4.
In the investigation of the United States Control and Profile of Disasters, this indicator is expected to be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are well-healing.
In other, more complex cases, from the beginning of the development of symptoms to the time of death, the most common period of 6 to 41 days was 14 days.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 were held by COVID-19.
In China, at 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of the cases were more than 60 years old and 75 per cent of the dead were associated with cardiac and diabetes.
The fact that the amount of COVID-19 may be much higher, since the Offices may not take account of dead persons who have not been tested — for example, in case of death in their homes, in older houses, etc.
Incomplete data in Italy testify that the number of persons during the pandemia has exceeded the Office of the COVID indicators by 4 to 5 times.
The press secretary of the United States Centres on the Control and Profile of Disasters (CDC) admits: "We know [the number of dead] below the fact." His words are confirmed by the reports on some unique cases in the United States. It is often incomplete with incomplete data in pandemies such as the H1N1 influenza epidemic in 2009. The first death was registered in Uhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death was registered on the Philippines on the parts of China, and in the regions of Asia, 14 February, in France.
On 28 February, more than ten: in Iran, South Korea and Italy was registered after the regions of China.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions in all continents, except Antarka, reported death cases.
All indicators are different depending on the region and the time of the disease; they are also affected by testing volumes, the quantity of health systems, the treatment schemes, from the beginning of the emergency of disease, and the parameters of population, such as age, half and general health. The Coefficient is a number of diagnosed infections divided in the specified period.
According to the statistical data of Johns Hopkins University, the total number of infections and infections is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) at 10 April 2020.
Data on different regions are different.
China has decreased from 17.3% (for those who have symptoms appeared from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who have symptoms occurred after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of ≥ 1% of the disease results (CFR) is the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from disease and the percentage of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (as diagnosed as well as non-diagnosed) patients who die from disease.
These statistics are not linked to a specific time and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Scientists were trying to calculate these indicators on specific groups of people.
According to the evaluation of the Centre of Medicines of the University of Oxford, the level of the Pandemia totally consists of 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The higher number of this area is being carried out with the results of the first random test on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with the statistical studies analysing the impact of CFR testing.
WHO claims that the current pandemia can be controlled.
The points and the exact length of the speed are not defined and may be distinguished depending on the location.
Macey Bonnie, the Pennsylvania University, acknowledges that “uncontrolled infectional insufficiencies usually go on the plate, and then, when the number of available sickness carriers is finished, they begin to go out.
However, in the present situation, it is almost not possible to make any predict on the event."
The Chine Government's senior medical adviser Jun Nanchan claims that “all can end until June” if all countries are able to perform and implement the WHO recommendations in order to stop the distribution of virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski from London School of Hygiene and Trop of Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 “will be cyclified for a year or two”.
According to the investigation carried out by the Emperor College under the Neal Ferguson, “to the time until vaccine is created (18 months or more)”, it is necessary to comply with the remote and other measures.
William Shaffner, the University of Vanderbilt believes: "I don't think that this coronavirus will ever disappear completely because it is so easily translated" and that it "can be converted to seasonal disease, as well as suffocating each year."
The viruality of new adversities will depend on collective immunity and mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be extremely irrespective, and some infected people may carry out disease without symptoms.
Two most distributed symptoms are high temperature (88%) and dry (68%).
The symptoms of my division include the strength, the education of mocrotes in spirit ways (slides), the loss of ovulation, the vomit, the pain in the mouse and the ingredients, the pain in the neck, the pain in the throat, the pain, the vomit, the blood cure, the diarrhoea or the cianosis. WHO acknowledges that it affects seriously the development of breast-feeding problems about each six person.
The United States control and profile of diseases (CDC) includes immediate symptoms such as respiration, persistent pain or impression in the breast, sudden sense of consciousness, distress and disturbance; in the presence of these symptoms, further disease may lead to severe disturbance, a severe respiratory distress-syndrome, sepsis, a seventh shock and death.
Some infected people may be ill, without any clinical evidence, but the results of the analysis confirm the fact of infection, therefore doctors recommend to place persons in close contact with patients under diagnosis, under strict control and investigation of infection.
Assessed by Chinese scientists, the number of cases of non-simptological rate of disease is from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (time between incidence and symptoms) is combined from one to 14 days; it usually consists of five days, until there is no fully clearness of the symptom loss: the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom was initially estimated by 30 per cent and then falling to 15 per cent.
There are still no details on how to spread the disease.
The illness is considered primarily transmitted during a close contact, as well as through small capsules, with air division, chihany or at the time of the time; the contact is underneath the contact between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Some studies in the open caps may be extended at a distance of 4,5 meters (15 meters) to 8,2 meters (27 meters).
There are suggestions that the virus can also be translated through small capsules in the air, which can remain in the air for a longer time, and that the respiratory caps can also be produced when exhausted, including during the time of the air, although the virus usually is not translated in the air.
The caps may fall into the mouth or nose of the people, as well as in the nails.
• Medical procedures such as intubation and heart-leaving reanimation (CRL) can lead to breathing and thus spread the virus in air.
It may also fall into the body if a person has a contaminated surface, including the skin, with the following touch to his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also fears that the virus can be translated through fecalia, but the risk of transmission is considered to be low.
The Government of China rejects the possibility of the SARS-CoV-2 physical transmission. The virus is most infected during the first three days after the symptoms occurred, although its distribution may occur as before symptoms as well as at a late stage of disease.
There were cases when tests were detected in trial tests within three days before symptoms appear, and this states the possibility of transmission of virus to the expression of symptoms.
There are only a few reports on the laboratory in cases of unsimptological fluid of disease, but in some countries, contact monitoring studies were also detected in cases of illness transmission from unsimptable carriers.
The collaborators of the Centre of Profile and Control of Disasters (ECDC) claim that it is not clear how easily the virus is spread, however, that one disease normally affects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on the non-stat (304) virus is able to live up to three days, on the carton surface for one day, and on the brain surfaces to 4 hours.
However, these data varied depending on heat and temperature, and in the case of home and other animals there was a positive result of COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transfer the virus to people, although the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contacting other surfaces to which infected people could touch.
The severe heavy respiratory coronaviral syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus found first in three persons with a pneumonic group of severe respiratory diseases registered in Uhana.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are met in nature in family coronavirus. Outside the body, the virus can be maintained with a vital muscle that solves its protective box. SARS-CoV-2 is largely compared with the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is supposed to have a zone origin.
The genetic analysis of the coronavir showed that it was geneticly classified with the kind of Betacoronavirus, such as Sarbecovirus (cellular line B) together with two other muscle virus steams.
At the entire genealogy level, he is 96% identical to other Museum Coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in a certain part of the follow-up of pangoline and human virus genetics.
The total genetic comparison for today shows that the largest percentage of the appearance (92 per cent) is between the pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but it is not enough to prove that the pangolines are intermediate virus.
The incidence of virus may be diagnosed preliminaryly on symptoms, although it should finally be confirmed with the analysis of a polymerate heavy reaction with a reverse transcription of the infected secret or computer tomography.
Results of the studies compared to the CCP and CAT methods used in Uhana showed that the CAT is significantly more sensitive than the CCP, even less specific, since many of its visualization functions correspond to other diseases and processes.
Since March 2020, the American Radio College has repeated the recommendation “not using CT for scrining or as a method of testing the first line in the COVID-19 diagnosis”.
WHO repeated several testing protocols on SARS-CoV-2, and the first of them was repeated on 17 January.
The test is carried out on a semi-free heat reaction in real time (RT-PCR).
It can be carried out on breathing tests and blood patterns.
Results are usually ready for a few hours to a few days.
The test is usually used to use the nosoglotic fat, even though it can be used to use the weapons. A series of laboratory and companies are developing serological tests that allow to find an antidetectives.
On 6 April 2020, none of them had been sufficiently accurate to be approved for a general application.
In the United States, the serological test, once Cellex, was approved to apply in extreme cases only by certificated laboratories.
The characteristics of the visualization of the symptoms on rentgenograms and computer tomography (CAT) are asymmetrical periferic reliefs on the type of glass and the lack of plural exhausts.
The Italian radiolog of the society is being made by the International Photo Base in cases of infection.
For comparison with other infections such as adonovirus, photographs of COVID-19, not under PCR tests, have a clinical specification.
A major investigation in China was conducted in comparison with the results of the CTC and testing of the CCP, and it was clear that, although photos are less specific in case of infection, they could be decrypted faster; they are more sensitive, and thus this diagnostic method can be considered as a tool for decreasing in infected areas.
In order to diagnose the virus using rentgenograms and computer tomography, surface neuron networks were diagnosed on the basis of experienced intellectual intellectual.
Strategy for prevention of diseases includes maintenance of personal hygiene, stealing of hands, avoiding touching the eyes, the nose or the mouth with furious hands, use of ≥ ≥ or cutting the salfts that should be exhausted at the same time after use.
Those who may have been infected should be dressed with the medical mask in human places.
In order to prevent disease transmission, it is also recommended to be physically removed from people.
However, the virus of the fig tree was spread in most of the regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread among the population, some members who do not know where and how they have been infected, and to medical patients who have been infected, it is recommended to use standard precautions and measures of precaution when contacting others and the means for the protection of the eyes. The monitoring of contacts is also a important method used by healthcare bodies to determine the source of infection and prevent its further distribution.
The effort of the citizens ' information on the location of the citizens with their mobile phones for this purpose has led to peace by the conduct of confidentiality, and such organizations as Amnesty International (Amnesty International) and more than 100 other organizations, has been made with statements required for human monitoring.
There were times and proposed various mobile applications for voluntary use; at 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups worked on a timely solution that ensures the confidentiality of personal data, such as the registration of the user's nearby to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the phone user is in close contact with a person whose test on COVID-19 has become local, it receives a corresponding notification; there are also unbased versions of how to prevent the infection, such as the weapons and mouth, which are actually ineffective.
COVID-19 vaccine does not exist at present, although organizations are working on its creation.
In order to prevent the dissemination of the disease, it is recommended that the hands be mixed.
The CDC (Center of Control and Profile of Disasters) also recommends to swim hands with milk and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or when a strong arm is contaminated, and before eating, after whispering, dishing or tissue.
This is necessary, since the virus is outside the body with a vital muscle that covers its protective box.
Furthermore, if the milk and water are not available, the CDC recommends to use disfunctional instruments for a speed-based sphere content at least 60%.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching the eyes, the nose or the mouth with angry hands.
The surfaces may be disappointed by a number of solutions (in the surface of the non-statual dezinfiction means begins to delay a minute after the delivery) with 62 to 71 per cent of etanol, 50 to 100 per cent of isop, 0.1 per cent of sodium hypochloride, 0.5 per cent of water transmissions and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent of iod-video.
Other components such as benzalconia chloride and gluconate chloride are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in the case of suspecting the COVID or its suspicion in the establishment, such as the office or the daily stationary, all spaces of such rooms, including offices, toilets, general employment, electronic equipment, such as plans, sensor screens, keyboards, remote management balls and bankomates used by people, dezinfects.
Medical organizations recommend to cover the mouth and the nose by the back side of a lock or a salpet and immediately to cut out the objects used by the hygiene.
For those who may have been infected, use of medical masks is recommended because the use of the mask can have the amount and range of exhaust products that are spread in the air when they are packed, kissing and ≥.
The WHO also issued an action on how and how to use medical masks.
According to Steven Griffin, a virusist at the University of Lids, “the risk of the medical mask can reduce the inclination of people to cut them up, and touching their hands is a main way of infection.” The masks are also recommended to apply those who think that they can be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people carry medical masks only if they are high risked, for example, with a person with COVID-19, although it also admits that the use of the mask actually allows to reduce the number of touches to the face.
Several countries began to call for the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC centres, the United States, recommend that weakening facial masks of non-medicin destination be carried out. China highlighted the importance of using single medical masks of health, especially if they are in close contact (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with others.
It is recommended in Hong Kong to carry out the medical mask in public transport or in human areas.
The Thailand health factors invite people to prepare face-weight masks in home conditions and remove them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens were prohibited to go out to the street without a mask closing nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Vietnam invited all citizens to carry out masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria committed all the visitors of the product magazines to provide medical masks.
The Government of Israel also invited citizens to carry out masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Thaiwan, from the middle of March, 10 million medical masks per day, the use of medical masks was prescribed for all passengers in trains and international buses.
In Panama, the people are responsible for carrying the medical mask out of the street; those who cannot get the mask were recommended to throw them in home conditions.
Medical masks are also widely used by Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (as well as fisic distantification) is a measure to combat infection to slowly expansion of disease by minimising close contacts between people.
Protection measures are related to carriers, travelling, closing schools, slaves, stadiums, theatres and trade centres.
People can take distance measures, staying home, driving, avoiding humans, using uncontact welcomes and physically distant from others.
Many regional governments, especially highly suffering from emergency, currently predict or recommend a distance.
The number of people that could be gathered in one of the recommendations of the US Governing Bodies and Health Organizations was operationally reduced by 250 people (in regions where there were no data on the distribution of the COVID-19), up to 50 people and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited the collection of groups including more than two persons; older people and ≥ suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension and weak immune systems, are increasingly risked to disease virus in serious form. The CDC recommends them as long as they can stay home if there is an emergency in the region. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other healthcare bodies began to replace the use of the term “social distance” in the ‘fiscal distance’, thus the objective of this measure is to reduce physical contacts in the frameworks, either by virtue of the disturbance.
The term “social distantification” was thus understood that people should be subject to full isolation rather than to remain in contact with other people in alternative ways.
Among the other, recommendations were given to enter in sex only with your permanent partners with whom you live, and you are sure that it has no virus and its symptoms.
Persons with COVID-19 diagnosis and those who suspect that they are infected are recommended self-isolation under home conditions.
Detailed and appropriate self-isolation policies, and the Governments of many countries also have been committed or have recommended to the whole population of the areas to carry on their own carrier.
Faces in high-risk groups were prescribed as a strictest karantine.
Persons who may have contacted COVID-19 or recently visited the country or region, at a significant degree of the epidemic, have been recommended to be on the carantine within 14 days since the latest possible contact.
Strategies of combating emergency include the sustainability of the spread of disease, pressure or disturbance.
The maintenance of the disease is carried out in early stages and aims to investigate and isolate the infected, as well as other infectional control and vaccination measures to remain in the middle of the rest of the population.
At the stage when the dissemination of the disease is not longer possible, effort is made to reduce the consequences: measures aimed at slow expansion and to reduce the impact of the epidemic on the health and society system.
The measures to maintain and reduce the consequences of dissemination of the disease can be taken at the same time.
The increase in the infection requires more extreme measures to repeat the pendemy by reducing the basic number of cases of infection to below level 1. The part of the infectional insufficiencies is aimed at reducing the epidemic epidemy, which is an equation of the curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of prevention of health services and provide more time for vaccine and treatment methods.
The non-specific interactions that can help to cope with the emergency include measures of personal profile such as hands, the use of medical mass and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distantification, such as closure of school and mass operations; the participation of the community in the promotion of such measures and participation in them; and measures for environmental protection, such as the cleaning of the tops. After serious effort has become evident in China, there have been more determined measures aimed at maintaining effort, such as the isolation of cities and the introduction of extreme prohibitions.
Other countries also adopted a number of measures aimed at spreading the virus.
A mass scanning and localised currencies have been introduced in South Korea, as well as the system of notifications on the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was given by self-isolated abilities and were highly affected by those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks and strafs were increased for the recovery of medical resources, and the modeling of British and United States showed that there are serious problems with regard to the slowness (slowness, but not the remaining of the epidemic distribution) and the pressure (residence of the epidemic growth) are serious.
The optimal policies of reducing the effects of the disorder of the disease can reduce the deep burden on the health system to 2/3, and the doubleness is, however, to lead to hundreds of thousands of health systems and to the collapse of health systems.
The pressure may be a preferred method, but it needs to be used until the virus circles between the population (or until the vaccine will be repeated, if it happens before), since, elsewhere, the dissemination of the disease will be repeated as soon as the measures are weak.
The long-term intervention in order to reduce the pandemia results in economic and economic costs.
The antiviral medicines approved for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently not available but are committed to their efforts, including testing of medicines.
Taking unreceptive medicines from prostitute, drinking enough weight and relaxation can help to facilitate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the patient, oxygen treatment, intravenous inhibition and respiratory support may be required.
The exposure of steroid medicines can only be used.
Several combinations previously approved for the treatment of other virus diseases are also considered to be used for the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic means” could facilitate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.

In commenting on the woods, Mr. Tedros stated that “no reasons for measures that are extremely preventing movements and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend trade and movement”.
On 5 February, the WHO addressed the world community with a request for $675 million to ensure the low-income epidemic preparation in countries, reporting the need to provide immediate assistance to those countries who “not have a system for human detection, infected by virus, despite that the epidemia has not yet reached these countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the demonstration of our readyness is the degree of preparation for the epidemic of our own call” and invited the international community to “ make a choice: investing today or paying in the future”. At the press conference on 11 February, the WHO established an official name of disease — COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterrish agreed to provide “the potential of the whole UN system in response to the problem”.
Consequently, the United Nations Crisis Management Group has been established, coordinating all United Nations responsible measures; these steps, as the WHO states, will “concentrate on health reactions, while other sciences can enjoy their experience to combat rapidly illness in a broader and economic plan”.
On 14 February, the WHO and China were initiated to establish a joint special group, which ensured the experts and WHO sites in China to assist in resolving the situation inside the country and the "seriousness of disease and infection" and organized seminars and meetings with leading national agencies, as well as the outcome to "the efficiency of reaction at the level of provinces and circles, including urban and rural areas", stated 25 February of the WTO that "the peace must make more to prepare the potential coronavirus pandemia, noted that "too early to call this illness to the Pandemys, but the countries, however, should be prepared for this."
On 28 February, the WHO stated that the rate of global distribution of coronavirs would be increased with “height” to “very high” — the highest level of preparation and risk.
Mike Ryan, the Executive Director of the WHO programme on emergency health situations, warned in his statement: “This is the verification of every government on the planet for the preparation for real position of matters: time to set up.
This virus may already be on the road to your country, and you must be ready, and it also stressed that responsible measures can help the world escape the “good scenario of development of events”.
Ryan also stated that the current data were not served in order to declare the global pandemia official representatives of the public health area, and added that the Pandemia's declaration would mean that “we actually recognize that everyone on the planet would have the risk of infecting this virus”.
On 11 March, the WHO announced the relief of the coronavirus of the pandemy.
The Director-General of the WHO stated that the WHO was “deeply calm as anxious as a high level of spread and seriousness of disease, as well as the less anxiety of inactivity in relation to this problem”. The WHO was a serious criticism for an inadequate approach to the understanding of the pandemia, including a later statement of emergency situation in the field of public health and the virus class as a pandemia.
As a response for a negative reaction to the situation in the address of the Director-General of the WHO, Mr. Tedros Adonoma was sentenced to the proposal of submitting 733 000 persons to the state of 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, decades of UN Human Rights Experts highlighted the importance of compliance with human rights during the COVID-19 pandemia.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to apply measures to rescue life and that the Government was responsible for such arrangements.
The Group emphasized that the lack of resources or medical insurance should not be in any manner appeal to discrimination against any specific group of people.
Experts underlined that each person has the right to health protection, including people with adequate opportunities, representatives of minorities groups, elderly citizens, internal moved persons, homeless, citizens who live in extremely bad conditions, prisoners, refugees and other non-contracted groups, need to support the State.
International Government organizations consider the economic and employment effects of the COVID-19 crisis.
Organization of economic cooperation and development has created a form to provide time and comprehensive information on responsible political measures in countries around the world, as well as to identify opinions and recommendations.

The Government of China was criticised by the United States, the Minister for the United Kingdom, Michael Gowa and Eduardo Bolsonar, the son of President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonar, for action against the Pandemie, which began with the Chinese province Hubai.
The number of communists of China's Party (CPC) provinces were allowed for the currency measures they had taken in the central part of China, and these releases were evidenced of the deficit of the responsible action of the political stability in these regions.
The commentators believe that this step was aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of Communists from the China Si Zhinpina party from the wrath of the public by the invasion of the coronavirus.
The Chinese factors, such as Jio Lizzjan, have expressed the notion of the previous statement of the beginning of the coronavirus in Uhana, but have taken part of the theory of the consequence of COVID-19 in the United States or Italy.
The United States President's administration Donald Trumpa called the coronavir as a Chinese virus or "Uchana virus" by saying that "Censor in China only disrupts the situation with a virus that now has become a global pandemia" and that statement has been criticized by some commentators who claim that this approach is racist and "reduces from the pressure of the President's administration to keep the disease spread".
The Daily Beast has received access to the US Governing Telegram, which contains the communications-freeness, apparently the National Security Council, and there are such mentions on: “All cases in China.
We are requested to distribute this information in any way, including press conferences and television expressions." The organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg said that China was a part of the “progressive efforts” in order to gain global impact.
The EU External Policy Chapter Joseph Borrell warned the presence of “the geopolitical component, including the fight against the influence by the piar and the so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China is sustainable to the idea of its role of the responsible and confidential partner, except the United States”.
China also invited the United States to cancel the sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some information to send assistance to the last two countries.
According to Jack Ma, 100 000 medical masks of Cube have been prohibited in relation to United States sanctions on 3 April.

The source accused Russia that she was trying to make a favorable impression on the world public at the level of geophylite and diplomate.
The President of Lombardia A ́elio Fontan and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Louisi Di Mayo, rejected the MMI attacks and expressed appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a carrier with medical assistance to the United States.
Press secretary Kremla Dmitriy Peskov said that “in proposing assistance to the American colleagues [Putin], the American medical and material producers would also be able to provide responsible assistance if necessary”.
NATO ' s 2020 ' s military teachings, scheduled in Germany, Poland and Baltic countries, are the largest NATO military learnings after the cold war - will be conducted in a short form.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament criticized Defender 2020 (Defender-2020): “In a crisis situation that has been committed today in the field of public health, the conduct of these teachings would threaten the lives not only by the United States and many of the People of Peace, but also by the inhabitants of the countries where such activities are to be carried out.” The Government of Iran was extremely affected by the virus. It was infected by about two ten members of the Parliament, as well as fifteen other political participants.
On 14 March 2020, the President of Iran Hasan Ruhani in an open letter addressed the world leaders with a request for assistance, noting that his country was complicated to combat the epidemic due to the lack of access to markets in relation to the United States' sanctions against Iran. The epidemic has made calls to the United States for the adoption of the policy spread in other states, including the introduction of a single health system and the advice for children, paying family reliefs and increased public health.
Politologists expected that this could have a negative impact on the chances of Donald Tromp to reelect the presidential elections of 2020, and that the diplomatic situations between Japan and South Korea were disrupted.
South Korea has discorted “insignificant and passive currency measures” in Japan after Japan has declared that any citizen coming from South Korea will be placed on a double-week currency in a special place from the Government.
The South Korean society was originally divided because of the response of President Mun Chain to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed the pentitions that were either invoked by the president or invited Mr. Munu to bring an impicement for the inadequate, according to their opinion, the reaction of the Government to the illness, and the Pandemie for the country to adopt the laws on emergency situations as a responsible measure.

The coronavirus was called for a number of cases of deficiency of supply in relation to global increased use of equipment for combating epidemics, buying goods in the conditions of panic and deficiencies of production and logistics.
The United States Administration on the Quality of Food and Medicinal Products was warned of the lack of medicines and medical equipment, which resulted in a growing consumer question and breakdown in the suppliers.
In several populations, there were also panic purchases; this led to the situation when the goods, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, were lost from half of the stores, which led to the deficiency of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns about delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of the WHO, Mr. Tedros Adonoma, the question of individual protection was 100 times.
This spring led to a twenty-fold increase of prices compared to the normal price, and to the delay of the provisions of medical products for four and six months.
He also caused a lack of individual protection funds worldwide, and the WHO warned that health careers would be attacked.
In Australia, the Daigo system buyers have received a new opportunity to sell Australian goods in China.
This activity led to a lack of food in some surmarkets and was then prohibited by the Government of Australia. Despite the high spread of cases of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Uchan region, as well as the high question of food products, it was possible to avoid the deficiency of food in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the acquisition of stocks and the illegal trade of critically important products that have been successful have allowed to avoid the deficiency expected in North America and North America.
Northern Italy, which has small scales, has not experienced significant falls, but, according to the representatives of growth, agricultural prices can grow.
Manufacturers of trades remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Uhan, while the Governing Boards of China provided access to the stocks of sugar to ensure the full-valuable food of the population.
Similar laws required by the manufacturers of food stocks in the case of emergency conditions are also in Italy.
The damage of the world economy was reflected in China: ≥ 16 March, China's economy suffered greatly in the first two months of 2020 because of the dissemination of the virus adopted by the Government, which reduced the volume of different sales to 20.5 per cent.
The main China is a major economic and productive center; therefore, a virus effort is considered to be a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agate Demarai, the Economyst Intelligence Unit, the voluntarity on the market will be maintained until a clearer presentation of potential results.

The self-isolation measures introduced in India will leave a lot of million Indian migrants receiving daily workers. The investigation conducted by the Angus Reida Institute showed that 44 per cent of Canadian homes were so or otherwise met without architecture. Almost 900 000 Spanish slaves also lost slave places from the time of the introduction of a close isolation in Spain in the midst of March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French slaves made statements for a timely debt, and 1 million British slaves received a single payment. Almost half million companies in Germany were transferred to the subsidyed Government’s decreased slave description — an incomplete slave day.
The German job payment scheme for an incomplete slave day was also introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The areas of experience and cultural heritage have also severely suffered from the pandemia that has affected the activities of organizations and officially employed or independent persons throughout the world.
Cultural and experimental organizations have tried to support their (frequently designated by the State) mission to ensure access to society ' s cultural heritage, ensuring their security and publicity and, where possible, supporting people of experience.
To March 2020, Museum, Libraries, Concert Halls and other cultural institutions were closed throughout the world for an undetermined period, or access was different, and exhibitions, activities and presentations were canceled or before.

Casino and other games throughout the world were closed, and poker tours, which are usually translated into the direct epher, were also reverse or cancelled.
This caused many players to go online, and many sites dedicated to azart games reported significant increase in the number of new signatures, and the dilution industry also suffered because different groups have stopped or cancelled the concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as broadways, have also cancelled all their acacias.
As an alternative to the traditional offline business, some artists and artists began to study the options of continuing their activities and exchange its results on the Internet, organize preliminary transmissions of online offices or web feasts, which helps people to continue to carry out, release or pipe their productions.
The Internet has been found on the subject of the coronavir, many of which I am humorist and agreed with anxieties that are characterized for periods of indetermination.
Since the presentation of the COVID-19 has been observed a deployment of preference, xenophobia and racism for the citizens of China and the people of East Asia, as well as the representatives of the population of heat points, the United States and other countries.
The events of fear, suspiciousness and hostility were observed in many countries, especially in the East Asia, North America and Asia-Pacific region.
In the inhibitation records for February (when most of the infections remained still in China) racisms expressed in various world-wide groups against China citizens who were likely deserved this virus or received a fair remuneration for anything.
In some countries, the growth of anti-Chinese structures is also observed.

Many newspapers with access to information have removed such information for some or all areas of corruption.
Many scientists have expressed their scientific articles to open access, dedicated to coronavirus.
Scientists decided to provide short-term access to the results of their investigations on the firms, such as bioRxiv.
Expanding infectional disease — Infectional disease from returning pathogen, distribution area or way of transfer of

The 2019 respiratory coronavir testing (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus with it includes methods that determine the presence of the virus, and methods for detection of an antidetectives produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the models is confirmed by the OCT-PCR, which recognises the RNA of coronavirus.
This test is specific and intended only to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus NCB.
It is used for recent or active infections.
The detection of anticipation (serology) can be applied both for diagnostics and for the purposes of popular control.
Anthyl analysis detects the number of people who have been affected by disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to address them to the hospital or who have been missing.
The exact level of this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of this test.
In March 2020, there were no reliable data on the spread of virus among the population in any country due to testing.
On 23 March, no country could check more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests carried out in different countries was totally contrary.
Such differences in information are probably strictly affected by registered indicators, which may be significantly higher in some countries.
The test can be carried out in tests from the breathing paths received by different ways, including the nasoglotic fat or the model of the mocrote, with a seal of the reverse transcription in real time (RRT-PCR).
Results are usually available for several hours to two days.
The OCT test on the fats taken from the throat is only relevant for the first week of illness.
Later, the virus can be disappeared from the throat, however, multiplied in the halts.
Infected patients tested for the second week of illness as an alternative may be taken from the lower breathing paths using a seat category or can be used for decreasing products (mocrote).
One of the early tests of the CCP was once used in the Charite clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, with a semi-free reaction with reverse transcription (RRT-PCR) and with the basis of 250.000 sets that later extended the World Health Protection (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom also repeated its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company K°biotech multiplied a set of sets to find SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the PowerChek Coronavirus (PCR).
It detects gen E, common for all beta-coronavirus, and gen RdRp, specific for SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese BGI Group was one of the first companies, received the authorisation of the National Medical Management of China for External Use of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the CCP. In the United States, the Centres for Control and Profile of Disaster (CDC) distribute their diagnostic panel through International Reactor Resources in real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel in the laboratory of public health.
One of the three genetic tests of the older test series issued incomplete results due to the unexpected reactions and the wide range of testing CDCs in Atlanta; resulting in the average of February 2020, less than 100 trials per day were made.
The tests used by two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date, public and employment laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Supervisory Office for Food Quality and Medicinal Products under External Permissions. The United States commercial laboratory began testing at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing on the COVID-19 test on the basis of the RT-PCR throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing on COVID-19 throughout the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantities have been stated; the compilation and analysis should be carried out in the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was once produced and produced by the State Scientific Research Centre for Virusology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service, reported that on 12 March 2020, Mayo was tested for the detection of COVID-19. 13 March 2020 Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA for the use of a test, which could be carried for 3.5 hours in a large range of tests, which allows one car to deal with approximately 4128 tests for 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an external authorisation for the use of Abbott (EUA) labs for testing the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued the Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also receives the EUA from the FDA for a trial of about 45 minutes.
FDA also approved the test in which the CPR is used as an ample technology of isothermic nuclear acid.
Since a series of temperatures is not required to perform this test, this method may find out the results in only five minutes, and the refuses in 13 minutes.
At present, there are approximately 18,000 such vehicles in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests daily. A test in Taiwan is currently developed with the use of a monoclone anticipate, which is specifically linked to the new coronary white (N-white) and is hoped to get results within 15-20 minutes, like the grip test.
In consideration of the specialized literature for March 2020, it is concluded that “the breast cell ring graphs have a small diagnostic value in early stages, while the results of the CT [computer tomography] may have such value even before symptoms appear.”
The typical characteristics found in the CT walk include double-sub-time multiples of the “mate glass” type with periferic, asymmetrical and aposterial distribution.
Sub-term domination, the symptom of bullshit and consolidation are developed as far as the disease is progressed.
Results of the studies compared to the CCP and CAT methods applied in Uhana at the time of the present pandemia showed that the CAT is significantly more sensitive than the CCP, even less specific, since many of its visualization functions are compatibil with other processes for pain and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American Radio College has repeated the recommendation “not using CT for scrining or as a method of testing the first line in the COVID-19 diagnosis”. In March 2020, CDC recommends and uses the CCR method.
Partly immune response to infection is expressed in you, including IgM and IgG.
These anticipations can be used to detect human infections after the 7th day of the presence of symptoms, to determine immunity and to carry out popular controls. The analysis may be carried out in central laboratorys (C); or by diagnostic (PCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to carry out high-productive systems, but their accessibility will depend on the speed of each such system.
In C_BAR_ one pattern of blood perifer is usually used, although serial models can be applied to monitor immune response.
In PoCT, one blood pattern is usually obtained by the roof of each cover.
On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have passed through all the registering procedures and can now spread their tests to an anticipation.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received only one extract test.
The testing production consists of a few hundred samples during a few hours and thus works much faster than the normal PCR analysis of the virus NCB.
Anthony can usually be found in 14 days after the infection.
In Hong Kong there was a schedule that allows patients with suspicion to stay home: "The collaboration of immediate assistance before the patient’s testing for a sample," the patient flees in it, returns and receives test results in a while. The British NHS announced the start of its pilot testing scheme of suspicious cases in cases that eliminate the risk of infection by other clinician visitors, or the need to determine the fast assistance machine if it was exposed to the patient's transport. In the event of the COVID-19 testing at the suspicious cases, the medical architect analyses, using all relevant precautions.
The testing centres helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and scale test procedures than in any other country. On 2 March, the National Association of Medical Insurance Insurance Physician stated that it was ready to conduct about 12 000 tests daily in ambulator conditions and that only 10 700 tests per week.
If an investigation is appointed by a doctor, the expenditure is covered by medical insurance.
According to the President of the Institute of Robert Koha, Germany's total production in the testing plan is 160 000 tests on the week.
At the time of 19 March, several major cities were tested.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests issued in Germany was not found because the results were only registered.
The first laboratory study showed that, as a result of a calendar week 12/2020 of SARS-CoV-2 was taken at least 483 295 analysis, including week 12/2020, and 33 491 model (6.9%), the result was local. The researchers of the Israeli clinic of Technion and Rambam Hospital were able to test simultaneously in 64 patients, the model division and further analysis only if the combined model shows a positive result. In Uhan 5 February 2020, the BGI was opened a temporary laboratory of the area of 2000 kv.
The building of this laboratory was organized by the BGI Van Zyanam and was completed in only five days; the modeling showed that if this laboratory had not been introduced into the exploitation at such an earlier temperature, the illness in Hubae would be 47 per cent more and, respectively, the cost of the curantine would also be two times above.
The Laboratories of Huo-Yanne in Shenchingen, Tenjine, Pekine and Shanghae were opened in the lab in Uhana, in general in 12 towns of China.
On 4 March 2020, the total ability indicators were 50 000 tests daily. The open multi-x schemes of Origami Assays were issued, which could test up to 1 122 patients in COVID19 with only 93 broadcasts. Such balanced coefficients may work in small laboratorys, other than the need for the use of worked hedge manipulators.
To March, as a result of a lack of and insufficient number of reactions, the mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States has become a problem.
Consequently, some authors referred to the test patterns on 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes in order to release GNC genes for further tests. On 31 March, the quantity of the coronavir tests conducted by the United Arab Emirates for the soul of the population at present exceeds the indicators of any other country, and most of the population will be protested.
This occurred by the possibilities of testing, together with the acquisition of the group 42 and BGI of the mass testing laboratory of the population (based on their laboratory for detecting emergency cases in China).
This laboratory, expanded in 14 days, is able to carry out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first worldwide laboratory in such a large scale that works outside China.
Different test options addressed to different parts of the coronavirus profile were held in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health has adopted the German option for the preparation of testing compounds sent to low income countries without resources to repeat their own.
The German warrant was repeated on 17 January 2020; the protocol, once the United States health-epidemiological centres had been not available until 28 January, which led to the lack of testing sets in the United States. At the beginning of the emergency in China and the United States, there were problems with the confidence of tests, and these countries, as well as Australia, were not able to provide sufficient numbers, recommended health experts.
In South Korea, as experts say, the broad access to tests has helped to reduce the distribution of the new coronavirus.
During several years, the Government of South Korea worked to ensure that the tests were mainly tested in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health has invited to develop the test programmes as the best way to slow up the COVID-19 Pandemy. As a result of the increase in testing as a result of the rapid distribution of virus, many private laboratories of the United States, in which hundreds of thousands of analysis models, were deteriorated and the stocks of materials for the prohibition of breasts and chemical reactions were rapidly disrupted.
In March 2020, China reported the issues of the precision of its tests.
The American test compacts, once the CDCs, had “sufficients” and therefore the Government removed bureaucratic barriers that interfered with private tests; Spain received test sets in the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of the use of these sets were unfair.
The company explained that the cause of inevitability of the results could be a failure to buy examples or wrong use of sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would reject the sets of unfair results and replace them by other sets of the Shenzhen Bioeasy company. 80 per cent of the test sets received in China were also recognised as irrelevant.
The Prime Minister Mattovich proposed to throw them down to Dunai. Atesh Kara, the Ministry of Health of Turkey, said that the test sets made in China had “height level of errors” and the Ministry “not used them”. The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test sets in China, but at the beginning of April 2020 was declared the failure to use these sets.
Carantial measures for persons whose analyses had a positive result of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the monitoring of people with such patients had the results.
Students who worked in the Italian city Wo, where a person died first in Italy from COVID-19, conducted two cycles of testing of all populations that included approximately 3400 people, with a interval of about 10 days.
Approximately half of people with local results had no symptoms, and all patients with diseases were placed on the carantine.
The movement to the territory of the population was closed, and this measure has completely stopped the distribution of the infection.
Within intensive monitoring of contacts, input, testing and carantine measures in Singapore, the coronavirus pandemia in 2020 was much less stressed than in other developed countries, and there was no extreme of such extent as a forced closing of restaurants and magazines.
Many activities there were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore began to urge the residents to stay home, but the schools in which the 23 March had been completed openly.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, were also undertaken by intensive monitoring of contacts, invasion, testing and karantine measures, but they had less aggressive characteristics.
The studies showed that in countries where more tests were carried compared to the quantity of ≥ ≥ ≥ the ≥ ] indicators were highly below, probably because more patients were able to be found with symptoms or symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries with no mass test resources, as well as national laboratorys with a close experience with COVID-19, send their first five local and the first ten negative results to COVID-19 into one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratory are in Asia, 5 in Property, 2 in Â, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The graph of the "local results" column indicators depend on the test policies adopted in a specific country.
The country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result in percentages compared to the country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of virus symptoms, under other conditions.
It is also the process of cleaning hands to eliminate pollution, grass, microorganisms or other injuries.
The regulation of the swimming hands at certain " critical moments" prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diaries and choleres, which are transmitted in a fatal oral way.
A person may also be infected by respiratory diseases such as grip or normal prostitution, such as if he touches the eyes, the nose or the mouth (that is to the slices) with unmatched hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which the hands should be washed with milk: before and after the defection, after the kids of the child's hedge or the exchange of rubbers, before the feeding of the child, before eating, and before and after the preparation of food, or for the preparation of sheep meat, fish and birds.
If water and milk are not available, the hands can be cleaned with the coat. The World Health Recommends to wash the hands:
Before, in time and after preparation of food.
Before and after the procedures of dealing with a painful person.
After the change of a babie or a kid walking to the toilet.
After smoking, swimming, or swimming.
After touching animals, feed or residues of animal origin.
Medical hygiene is responsible for hygiene actions with medical procedures.
Blanking the hands before taking medicines or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the distribution of the disease.
The basic medical goal of braking is to clean hands from patogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms capable of provoking diseases) as well as from chemical arts that may occur or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing food or working in medical fields, but it is also important for all other people.
It is very good for health: for example, it leads to the minimum distribution of influenza, coronavirus and other infections, prevents diarrhoea infections, reduces the distribution of respiratory infections,
and decreases the level of childhood in households.
The 2013 investigation showed that a higher quality of hands could lead to a small increase in children in age to five years.
In developing countries, the indicators of respiratory and diarrhoea diseases can be reduced by using simple habits such as the mixing of hands with milk.
This elementary procedure is able to reduce the level of ≥ 50 per cent of those diseases.
The rules of reminders of the use of hands can reduce the number of diarrhoea cases to approximately third, and this will be compared to the low level of income of purewater regions.
The decrease of diarrhoea for 48 per cent may be with mysterious hands, which is the only most effective and unfair way to prevent diarrhoea and adequate respiratory diseases in each house, schools and other public sites worldwide.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of the ORI, is the main cause of child abuse to five years, which brings about 1.8 million children to year.
Of diarrhoea and pneumonia, almost 3.5 million children per year are lost.
The United Nations Child Foundation reports that the mixing of hands with milk before and after a toilet, which is a strong custom, can save more lives than any vaccine or medical involvement, and reduce the diarrhoea of almost two, and the deep respiratory infections are fourth.
It is usually associated with other sanitary activities conducted in the framework of water supply, sanitary and hygiene programmes (WASH).
It also prevents the emergency of impetus - illness translated in the immediate physical contact.
A small negative consequence of the frequent brake of hands is that it can cause the skin to be sucked and therefore to her damage.
In 2012, the Danish study showed that too often the hands can lead to a thickness and swallowing of skin - to a disease such as an ecstasy or a hedge, which is especially distributed among health careers.
It may also be considered too frequently to be one of the symptoms of obsession-compulsory disturbance.
There are five such “critical moments” during the day when the mixture of hands with a smile is important to reduce the risk of physical oral transmission of illness: after exhaustion (smoking, defection), after mixing the child's bottles (smoking) before feeding the child, before taking food and before/after preparing of food, or on the meat, fish or birds.
Other events where hands should be weakened to prevent the transmission of disease: before or after the ruption of the wound or the wound, after whispering, or smoking, after touching animal origin or animals, after touching the muscle.
In many countries, the process of mixing of hands with milk has not been sufficiently distributed.
In 2015, a study of hands held in 54 countries showed that in the average of 38.7 per cent of the mixture of the mixture was generally adopted. The 2014 study showed that the highest indicator, 97 per cent, was fixed in Saudi Arabia; this list is closer to the middle of the United States, 77 per cent of them; the lowest indicator was identified in China, 23 per cent. There are now several methodology of behaviour and you are used to break hands in critical situations. In developing countries, the group movement of schools at the appointed day is one of the methodology that helps children to train such procedures.
The ‘Independent Medical Assistance Programme’, which is designed by the Philippine Education Ministry, is an example of broad-scale activities in strengthening health and increasing children ' s education.
This national programme is based on a deceleration two times a year, as well as a daily mixture of hands with milk and a daily cleaning of teeth with furnace.
The same programme is implemented successfully in Indonesia.
The elimination of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective if the mixture process is added to the mixture or toys.
The basic efficiency of milk and mines is to eliminate bariers in order to solve and increase its level.
The water itself is not considered an effective means to clean the skin, since the whites and whites that I are components of organic pollution are wrongly dissolved in water.
The amount of water, however, contributes to the cleaning process.
A strong milk, due to multiple applications, may also contain bacteria that may fall on it in the previous use.
A small number of studies dedicated to each cover of the bacteria with a contaminated dust of a solid oil refers to the small probability of such a occurrence, since the bacteria are laughing with a pen.
The CCP still claims that “the hand-hand-doseer is a preferential option for the mouse of hands”.
The antibacteriaal milk is actively announced in communities that forget their health.
Today there is no evidence of the fact that the use of recommended antiseptical or disabilizing means is a selective effect on organisms with sustainability to antibiotics in their nature.
However, antibacteriaal milk contains distributed antibacteria agents, such as triclosan, which is sustainable to resistant body stamps.
Thus, even if the antibiotic stamps are not elective to antibacterian milk, their efficiency may not be incompatible with the advertised.
Furthermore, the super-active arts and resources for the protection of skin, complex units may contain acids (exusive, and milk) as a RN regulator, as well as an antimicrobial active benzinic acid and other waste (alias faith, vitamins, mentals, extractions). The analysis conducted by the University of Public Health of Oregon showed that in order to prevent diseases and remove bacteria from the skin, the simple variety of mules are as effective as the ordinary antibacterial milk, which contains triclosan.
The warm water is comfortable for the skin of the temperature still is insufficient to kill bacteria.
Bacteria are multiplied much faster at the body temperature of 37°C.
However, for the elimination of natural animals with pollution and bacteria, the warm mixture water is more effective than cold.
Despite the disseminated opinion, scientific studies showed that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of the mixture on hands.
The defining tool for hands (saniteser) or hand antiseptics is a tool for hygiene of hands without water.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21th century, the population of the resources for hygiene on a sphere base which contains no water (as well as dezinfictors for hands on a sphere basis, antiseptical instruments for hands or sanitaries).
Most of these resources are produced on the basis of the isop of a sphere or a tenol with the additives, such as the carbomer (acre acid polymer) in the form of gela, or inflammators, such as glycerin in a thickness or penal form, providing the use of these resources and reducing the skin sucking effects.
Addition of the diluted water broadcast increases the anti-microbial activity, and the decifizing means containing at least 60-95% of the sword effectively.
The disinfectators are killing bakteries, including bakteries with anti-medicatic sustainability (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis packaging, and some virus (including HIV, herpes, RSV, renovirus, vaccine, grip and hepatitis) and gribs.
The dezinfictors containing 70% of the spire kill 99.97% of the bacteria (logarithm of decreasing 3.5 analogue to 35 decibel) in hands in 30 seconds after the use and 99.99% of the bacteria (logarithm of 4-5) in hands within 1 minute after the use. The destination means for hands are the most effective against the bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
The deficiencies on a sphere are almost ineffective against viruses of the type of norvirus (or Norwalk), most frequently caused by the infection gastrointestinal. It is necessary to use sufficient antiseptics or spirt contents to carefully address and test the skin from both sides.
The face and back surface of both ladons, as well as the space between the fingers throughout the length, are growing for about 30 seconds until the weight, the pen or the gel are completely questioned.
The fingerprints on both hands should also be stuck. The United States Control and Profile Centre recommends to make a choice in the use of hands and not in the use of disabilities, especially if the hands are extremely contaminated.
The growth of the population of such disabilities is the simple use and rapid use of microorganisms, but they should not be replaced for a full-valued mixture of hands if it is possible to use water and milk.
The frequent use of disinfecting resources on the basis of a speed may cause skin dryness if their composition contains no mixing and/or skin inflammators.
Suspending the skin may be reduced or removed by adding glycerin and/or other mixing materials to the component.
In clinical trials, dezinfectation of materials on the basis of spirals containing mixing components caused significantly less disorder and dryness of skin than the weapons or antimicrobial weapons.
Allergical contact der, contact craft syndrome or hypersensitivity to the spite or additives present in dezinfiction means are almost not available.
The lower probability of an injury of contact der has become a factor in the choice of disabilities compared to milk and water.
Despite their efficiency, the means that contain no water are not cleaning their hands from organic arts but simply disdefiniting them.
That is why disabilities for hands are not so effective in preventing many pathogenic microorganisms, such as normal milk and water, since pathogenic microorganisms still remain in their hands in use of such means.
The efficiency of the dezinfecting means for non-spereless hands depends significantly on components and composers, and has been significantly lower than the spider or the sphere container.
Recently, it was demonstrated that the medicinal products used by benzalcoin chloride, steady and cumulative antimicrobic activity, which, as probably, lose efficiency after multi-fold use, probably because of progressive effects of each side effect.
Many people in low income communities can not allow themselves to swim and replace it with oil or glass.
Salt or glass can be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than milk.
One of the problems with this method is that if the glace or oil are contaminated by microorganisms, it may, in contrast, increase the expansion of the disease.
Like milk, the oil is a dezinfectant means, as water contacts make a salt solution.
If the wheat is not available, the WHO alternate recommends use of oil or sand.
In order to prevent infection infections in the United States, it is recommended to apply the maintenance technology including:
Put your hands under warm or cold steel water.
It is recommended that the steady waters be contaminated, and the water temperature is not significant.
Help your hands by spreading them with a large amount of milk, including the back side of the ladons, as well as the areas between your fingers and under your legs.
Amlo removes microbs from the skin, and studies implies that when weapons are used (not only one water) humans are moving their hands more deeply.
Three hands for at least 20 seconds.
The train helps to remove microbs from the skin, and as longer you have your hands, more microbs are removed.
The hands are stumbled under the progress water.
Pushing hands in water can result in a re-inflammation.
Put your hands out of the pure bottle or let them dry out.
Moody and cold hands are increasingly contaminated; most often people remain without any attention, such as big finger, inflammation, between their fingers and under their legs.
Experimental legs and the crashed lake for feet can contain microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use an inflammator to prevent the drying of the skin of hands that may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If the transient water and milk are not available, there are different ways to wash the hands: water washing from the higher canister or bottles with processed openings and/or use of oil, if it is necessary, such as developing countries. In places with water supply (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are water-free solutions such as footnote and other non-depreciated options.
The corner with a feet pedal is a simple co-operation consisting of the emblems on the wheel, and a knife rubber that should be pressed for the water to be thrown on the hands; it should be used to use a cup of oil.
The effective sugar of hands is the inextensive part of the process of hygiene, but some conflicts in the conduct of the most effective form of sugar in public trains are conducted.
The growing volume of studies shows that papers are much more hygiene than electrical sockets for hands installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the Westminster University in London was conducted an investigation, which was a sponsor who had a warm air symposium and more modern air sugars for hands.
It was established that the total number of bacteria on the fingers in the average increased by 194 per cent and 254 per cent on the ladders.
The total number of bacteria on the fingerprints was also increased by 42 per cent and 15 per cent on the ladders.
The total number of bacteria on fingers in the middle of the fingerprints is reduced to 76 per cent and at the ladons is up to 77 per cent, and the scientists have also been tested to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several visitors of the toilet and the toilet in each type of sugar.
Strong air drought, which releases air with 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 km/h), is able to extinguish micro-organisms from hand and from its own block and potentially injury to other users of the toilet and sanus in the radio to 2 meters.
The swimming sushlook for hands with warm air spreads micro-organisms in the radius up to 0.25 meters from the sush.
In 2005, TÜV Product and Environment conducted an assessment of various methods of drought.
The changes in the number of bacteria depending on the sucking method of hands are observed:
There are many different suppliers for hands, and hand-sushes are compared to sucking papers.
The cleaning of hands with use of dezinfecting salpets may be an alternative decision during travelling in the lack of milk and water.
The defining instrument for hands should contain at least 60 per cent of the spider.
The medical way of moving hands is binding long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Earthways found his high efficiency (in 1846) in the profile of diseases under stationary conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospitals of the need to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices really helps to reduce the level of infection.
The medical mixture of hands takes at least 15 seconds, using a large quantity of smoke, water or gel for the mixing and throwing of each part of the hand.
The hands should be stumbled closely with the fingers.
If there is a grape under the legs, it can be used to remove it.
Since microbs can remain in the water on their hands, it is important to swim them well and lose them with a pure floor.
After a dry hand, closing the crane and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, the paper bottle should be used.
This allows us to avoid repeated inflammation of the hands from these tops.
The aim of the mixing of hands in medical institutions is to remove pathogic microorganisms ("microbs") and to prevent their distribution.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the system of hands remains inacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and sisters reg forgot to wash their hands before touching patients and thus spread microorganisms.
Following one studies, the correct mixture of hands and other elementary procedures may reduce the level of blood flow infections used by category to 66 per cent. The World Health Protection has repeated a footer with the image of the standard muscle procedure and the hands to be applied in the health sector.
The WHO project and operations are also available on its website and open for public discussions.
Whitby was conducted in consciousness.
If the regulatory requirements are required, commercial devices can be used to measure and check the hygiene.
World Health Protection means "five moments" when it is necessary to wash the hands:
after contact with blood or biological weights,
before use of antiseptics, as well as
The adding of antiseptical chemicals to milk in the mixture of hands (“medicin’s ” or “antimicrobial ” milk) helps to produce bacteria.
Such antibacteria may be properties before operations or in the middle of high contents of antibiotics. For ‘clearing ’ hands before the operation, it is required to include and exclude the crane that can be included without the hands of it; to use a few chlorides or ione waters to wash the hands, stears to dry hands after the mouth, a steril box for training and another sterile tool for cleaning under the nacks.
All improvements should be removed.
This procedure requires a mixture of hands and before a lock is usually within 2 to 6 minutes.
There is no need to lose hands too long, for example 10 minutes.
During the swimming, the water with the front should not fall back on the hands.
After the finishing of the mixture, the hands are dry with a sterile tissue and hope the chirurgical calat.
In order to reduce the distribution of microbs, it is better to wash your hands or to use an antiseptic for hands before and after the procedure of the emergency.
For the fight against stafilocock infections in hospitals, it was established that the highest benefits of the hands are the first 20 per cent of the fat, and that very few added benefits were obtained when the frequency of hands was increased by more than 35 per cent.
In comparison with the muscle of antibacteriaal milk, the mixture of hands with the normal muscle leads to more than three times the frequency of bacteria infections transmissible through food, comparing the contrast of hands containing the solvent and mixing the hands of antibacteriaal mixture, in average for 30 seconds per procedure, showed that the risk of spertocontaining solution reduced the bacteria contamination by 26% compared to antibacteriaal muscle.
However, I feel more efficient than spiral solutions for hands in order to decrease the number of influenza A H1N1 and Clostridio diff. The development of hygiene in medical institutions may include the training of the staff with hands, the increased access to spertocontaining solutions for hands, as well as the written and oral reminders of the need to wash hands.
An additional study of the most effective types of measures in various medical agencies is required.
In developing countries, mixing hands with milk is recognised as an economic and important means to improve health and even food.
However, the absence of stable water supply, milk or means to switch hands in houses, schools, and in slaves in the morning places is the advantage of the rule to wash their hands.
For example, in most rural areas no longer in each private or public toilet, there are crafts for the moving of hands, although there are some ways to organize their hands in such places.
However, insufficient hygiene of hands can also be caused by radiated habits, not by the lack of fat or water.
Promotion and stimulation of the mixture of hands may affect political decisions, increase the level of awareness of the use of hands and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
In order to ensure effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and results must be carried out.
In the system analysis, 70 studies have been established that for improving the situation with hygiene hands in countries with average incomes below, a effective health-epidemic supervision at Community level, while the public market campaign is less effective. One of the examples of the promotion in the schools on the mouth of hands in schools is the approach of the United Nations Children's United Nations Fund: it propagates 'i'i in the schools of simple economic measures stimulating students' hands with use of milk, as well as the implementation of other hygiene requirements.
In order to meet minimum standards, schools may increase their levels from one to three stars.
The establishment of handhelds is one of the measures set out in the context of the inhibition campaigns in order to reduce the disease and employment levels.
The World Day of Arms (Global Hand Washing Day) is a second example of the in-working campaign aimed at changed behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 Coronavirus, the United Nations Children's Fund continues to use the ́ods that symbolize hands.
In some surveys, the general efficiency of the maintenance in developing countries in comparison with the DALYs indicator (reserved years of life without invalidity).
However, one of the studies suggests that the stimulation of the mixture of hands with milk is a significantly more economic solution compared to other health measures.
The importance of moving hands for human health, especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or vulnerable soldiers in hospitals, was first recognised by two in the middle of the 19th century in the hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Sammelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), working in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Naitingale (Florence Nightingale), the English nurse, and “the foundation of the modern attack of diseases”.
At that time, most people have still believed that infections were caused by the inflammation of myasms.
In the 1980 ’ s, in relation to disease inhibitors, through food trade and infections with medical assistance, the United States Control and Profile of Disasters were more actively promoting hygiene as an important step to prevent the distribution of infection.
As a result of the increase in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemia in 2020, people in many countries have become better understanding the importance of weeping hands to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, near public tourists, as well as office trains and airports, posters with “righteous hand-moving techniques”.
The phrase “smiling hands” means the manifestation of its demand to take responsibility for anything or to be part of anything.
It comes from the Bible, Matthew’s Gospel: Pontius Pilate “smiled his hands ” by making decisions about Jesus Christ’s baptism; then this phrase was more useful in some English communities.
In the song of McBath Shakespeare, Lady will begin to swim down his hands in trying to cleanse from in an unclean consciousness in relation to the crimes she has committed herself and encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also established that people who remembered or observed any non-ethical acts often had to slip their hands in comparison with other people, and the handholders have more important importance for them.
Moreover, less likely, those who have the opportunity to cut their hands after seeing will participate in any other “clear” compensation, such as voluntary activities.
In religious religions, it is also an importance of gigantic goal, and it is a symbol of water but without milk. It is a part of the ritual of many religions, including the bahaism, the hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in the Christianity and Woodhu in Islam, and religions also predict a huge mouth of hands, especially after certain events.
Induism, Jewish and Islam provide for the commitment of the hands after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sicchism and Islam, it is considered a mixture of hands before and after each feed.
Control of productive factors relating to COVID-19
The monitoring of productive factors in relation to COVID-19 is undertaken by the application of methods for the safety of work and health in order to control risks and combat coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate control of risks on the slave depends on the place and the jobs, based on assessing risks, severity of epidemics in the community and risk factors for departments that may be vulnerable with COVID-19.
The United States Labour Protection and Industrial Hygiene Office (OSHA) reported that jobs with less risks have a minimum contact with public and colleagues, and in such cases, basic measures are required in combating infections, including hand washing, stimulating the home at the signs of illness, keeping the respiratory label, as well as conducting daily abortion and the disabilities of the environment.
Medium risk duties require common or close contacts with persons with no COVID-19 or suspicious diagnosis, but there is a possibility of infection in relation to the current distribution of disease in society or in the course of poetry.
Such category can be held by people who contact the public, such as schools, slaves with a high level of population and in some major different stores.
The risk control measures for such groups, other than the basic infection profile, include the use of high-effective air filters, the use of protective screens and personal protection means for contact with the person infected with COVID-19.
The OSHA believes that the medical institutions and marbles contacted with a person with a diagnosis or a suspicion of COVID-19 are related to a high risk category; thus the risk increases to a high level of such procedures, conducting aerosol education, or collecting/requirement of a person with a diagnosis or suspiciousness of COVID-19.
The risk control measures appropriate for such engineering-technical safety means, such as ventilations with negative pressure, as well as personal protection funds for the relevant task.
The COVID-19 covering can provide various types of impact on the slave.
Workers may be lacked on a slave in relation to their own disease, the need to care for other matters or the fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns may be changed both in relation to the types of goods in question and how to obtain such goods (e.g. the compilation of purchases in non-speed periods with delivery or service, unless out of the car).
Finally, the delivery of goods from the geographical regions covered by COVID-19 can be used in order to organize protection plans for preparation for epidemics and responsibilities.
The plans are concerned about risks that have different jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors that arise homes and communities, as well as risk factors of age or chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the control means to solve such risk problems, as well as the plans of external activities for situations that may result in the epidemic.
Plans for preparation for epidemic and responsibilities may be subject to the recommendations of national level or state level.
In order to ensure responsibilities in relation to the epidemic: reduction of the distribution of virus among staff, protection of people under higher health risks, maintenance of business operations and minimising the negative effects of other organizations in their provisions.
Responsible measures affect the seriousness of diseases in the community where business is located.
The risk control resources are a widely used structure for safety and working hygiene for grouping such resources depending on effectiveness.
If COVID-19 is not allowed to eliminate the risk of illness, the most effective engineering and technical security means, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
Engineering-technological security means under the isolation of the risks with which they are not trusted in the behavior that may be the most economically beneficial solution.
Administrative measures provide amendments to slave policies or procedures required by a person or a person.
Personal protection tools (PPE) are considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protection shall be chosen depending on the threat of a person's owner, suitable to the size (e.g. respirators), to be used permanently and appropriately, to be checked, supported and replaced as appropriate, as appropriate, as well as to deal with, clean, and maintain, or to avoid infection.
The United States Labour Safety and Industrial Hygiene Office (OSHA) believes that jobs with minimum risk have a minimum contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures for combating epidemics recommended for all slaves include frequency and careful mouths of hands, recommendations for the sickness of those who remain home, keeping the respiratory label, including closing the mouth in hands and kitchening, providing salpets and containers for the mouse, preparing for remote or changing, where necessary, recommendations for the use of other instruments and equipment, as well as the conduct of daily eating and disabilities of the environment.
The quick detection and isolation of persons who may be potentially infected is a critical step to protect people, customers, visitors and other persons on the slave.
The United States Centers for Disaster and their Profile (CDC) recommend that the symptoms of severe respiratory diseases remain home before the breast-feeding, the lack of a higher body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medicines or other medicines that eliminate the symptoms, and provides for the safety of the policies on the hospitals, allows them to stay home for a painful member of the family and to provide information about such policies.
According to the OSHA, average risk posts require frequent and heavy contacts at the distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons with no data or suspects on the infection of COVID-19 but there is the possibility of infection of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to the distribution of disease in the area where business is or in relation to recent drivings of such a COVID-19.
These categories are related to the engineering-technological security tools for such groups and groups with higher risks, such as schools, workers with a high level of population and some major different tradings. Admin measures for such groups and groups with higher risk are the establishment of high-effective air filters, the enhancement of ventilation, the establishment of physical barriers, such as the transparency of plastic protection screens, and the mobilization of services for customer service without auto-output. Administrative measures for such groups and groups, the financing of higher risks, the financing of the entity's entity, the financing of the Officer's Office, the Officer's Officer's Office and the Officer's Officer's Officers, the Officer's Officer's Officer's, the Officer's Officer's, Officer's and the Office's'Afficificifici's, Office's, Office's, Office'S, Office's, Officer's, and Office's'Afficificificifici's, and Office'As, Office's, Office's's's, Office'Affici's, Officer's, Officer's, Office Officer's, Officer's's, Officer's, Office Officer's, Office Officer's, Officer's, Officer's, Officer's, Office's, , , Office's, , Office's, Office's, Office's, , Office's, Office's and , , , Office's's's's's's's's's's's's's's's's's and Office's''''''''' Office'''s's's's's''''''''''''s'''s's'''''''''s, Office''''``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
In rare cases, there may be a need for respirators to be carried out in such a risk group.
If a person has been sick in the aircraft, there are measures such as isolation of a sick person from other people at race of 6 feet, designation of a member of a painful person, the delivery of a sick mask or the treatment of such person with a request to cover the nose and the mouth of the salft in the case of a sickness.
Increased members of the team should have a single medical tissue when approaching a sick traveller or in comparison with physological liquids or potentially infected surfaces and may be added to the personal protection means if a disease, a regulatory or a breathing difficulty.
In cases of commercial adjudication, including cross-lines and other passenger ships, the safety measures of the ships in the case of sickness, self-isolation and immediate information of the medical centre on the ship in the light of the ship or any other symptoms on the board should be placed in a bio-safe mixture, and the illness of the illness, self-isolation and the immediate information of the ship's medical centre.
In the ideal, the medical examination should be carried out in the isolated castle. In the case of schools and agencies for children, the CDC recommends to carry out a short-term closure for the destruction or dezinfection if a infected person is in the school, independent of the distribution of the disease in the community.
In the case of a minimum or medium-proliferation of the infection in the community, it may be possible to introduce displacements, such as the cancellation of outcomes for similar meetings, meetings and other mass activities such as the occupation of physical or hot drinking, the receipt of food in cafeteria, the increased distance between parties, the time of arrival and the outcome, the non-processed visits, the use of healthcare institutions for children with influenza symptoms.
In significant levels of distribution in the community, other than distance, measures for long-term school non-session may be considered, and for legal protection bodies who carry out daily responsibility, the direct health risk is considered to be low, according to the CDC.
Corporates of legal protection bodies responsible for contact with the diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same instructions provided for by the farmers for quick assistance, including the use of appropriate personal protection means.
When a close contact occurs in the detention, the employees should clean and disabilize their formal halts and equipment before re-using by means of resident cleaning aircrafts or by pursuing, to comply with standard operational procedures for prevention of disease and personal protection tools, as well as for use and clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and maritime institutions are high or very high risked.
High-risk posts are related to medical assistance, support, laboratory and medical transport staff contacting patients with diagnostic diagnosis or the proposed COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection in their procedures, conducting aerosol education, or collecting/recurrence tests from persons with a diagnostic diagnosis or the COVID-19 supposed infection.
Aerosol educational procedures are related to controlling, providing procedures, bronchoscopy, some stomatological procedures and investigation or collection of invasive methods.
In the case of high-risk martyrs, those who are concerned about the body of persons with a disease or a suspicion of COVID-19 at their death are related to; if these are being covered, they go to a very high risk category. Additional engineering-technical safety means for such groups include the use of isolated places for patients with underlying disease or suspicion on COVID-19, including in the course of procedures, which lead to aerosol education.
In some health protection institutions and margins, it may be effective to apply special ventilation with negative pressure.
The tests should be addressed to the compliance with the precautionary measures provided for for biologue safety level 3.
The World Health Protection (WHO) recommends that those who are in progress in a limited area of expectations depending on the suspicion of COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protection means, OSHA recommends and use respirators that are involved at 6 feet with patients with illness or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the procedures conducting aerosol education.
In the United States, NIOSH respirators for ≥ N95 or higher class filters need to be implemented in the framework of a comprehensive repair protection programme, which indicates the requirements for individual selection of means and medical reviews.
Other types of respirators can ensure more effective protection and comfort for Property. WHO does not recommend and use special clothing because COVID-19 is a illness that is transmitted respiratoryly, not through physical weight.
WHO is recommended to use only chirurgical masks for the staff performing the screening at the time of the patient's acceptance.
The WHO recommends that patients with COVID-19 or transmissioners of this disease, without aerosol educational procedures, carry out a chirurgical mask, protective eyes or a protective screen for ≥, calat and bottles.
In the implementation of the procedures conducted by aerosol education, the mask surgery should be carried out by N95 or FFP2.
Taking into account the insufficiency of individual protection in the world, the WHO recommends to minimize the need for protection in such means with regard to the use of distant medical, physical barriers, such transparency, the access to the patient infected with COVID-19, only those who are directly encouraging, the use of the personal protection only for a specific task, the continuous use of one and the same respirator, not taking account of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of personal protection and recommendations.

Topic: [Covid-19] Easy to charge and prepare for the future
EXPIRY DATE/Time: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
RESOLVATION: CC0: No protected rights
This month, we live in extreme circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemy is a manifestation that brings light on the relationships of people in the world and is responsibility to each other.
We had no such problems previously, but we have the fact that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to compliance, cooperation and development of the communities worldwide, which is based on such organization.
We have watched the companions and forgotten relationships between all our colleagues, which were reflected in electronic rescription, sounds and chats, which were wonderful under the fact that, for lucky, we have been working wonderful people with us.
I'm very grateful and amazing about you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of the high assessment of our work.
I believe that it is important for the world to contact Wikipedia right now, and how important it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible by your ability to ensure that sites are robots, payments to our colleagues or the security of the communities.
The world needs information presented in Wikipedia, and this is even more important than ever before.
At that time to achieve significant results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but and how we do this.
As regards the importance of this mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in our joint work, starting with the week.
Correction of our work and graphics
As said earlier by Robin, the "c-team" team was gathered yesterday night to discuss our approach and graphics on the next days and months.
In communicating, we examined our ideas on the most effective steps in the present situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
Most of us wanted to decrease the pressure and support the long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, let's go.
For all staff, suppliers and subsidiaries:
We expect to work approximately 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before the following orders come.
We don't declare outcome days: if you can work normally for more hours, this will be allowed for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever you need, whether you forget about your family, whether you get goods or go to your doctor, your well - being is our priority number one.
We're not watching your slave time.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
It's understandable and unrespectable, but we're talking about it.
It is not necessary to form a hospital sheet or all: simply inform your attendee and help the team to review the calendar and the work graph to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a COVID-19 diagnosis, report Brian from T&C Ops to ensure T&C figs support and careful guidance from your situation).
The payment of time rates will be carried out in full amount.
We have already declared and confirmed our commitment to compliance with our subsequents and payments.
Each person will receive a payment of normal periodic rates applied under normal circumstances.
This is, in particular, under the periods of disease when you can't work.
If you're working, we'll support you.
Many people use it as a way to make their efforts in the world around us.
What we do can bring wonderful results, especially in such times.
And again talking about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with our ruemen so that we know what to expect, and we would be able to correct our actions accordingly.
The types of work are considered to be adequate.
Such activities should always be supported.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Savety and Fundraising (other) commands are critically important for which additional support can be needed.
We initiate the process for all of the divisions to evaluate the current objectives and focus on support, which is extremely important for our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we simply focus on the most important projects.
Slowness today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We are not planning to work "double more to overcome the loss" after the end of the pandemia.
You will not need to work overtimely to meet the non-real periods for the current time.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will work on the establishment of new objectives and terms, as possible.
What happens to the APP (year plans)?
To support the new reality and expectations of daily slavery, we are able to address the time of the implementation of our Year Plan for 2020-2012.
We are going to propose a long time for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for the forming of the budget, allowing them to give priority critically important, self-aid and department of neighbors, and thereby all who are needed or who want to work will provide a reduced graph for the next few weeks.
Such duration allows significantly to reduce the current planning and tension burden throughout the organization.
On the next week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, and we will inform the representatives and teams of the current information on the steps, as well as after the receipt of the relevant undertaking.
Thanks to the APP team for the role in this.
With Office, risks, and breakfast
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected by the COVID-19 virus.
Nevertheless, in addition to the precautionary measures, we have taken a anti-virus relief team to deficit all surfaces in the Office in San Francisco.
They have spent the antiviral solutions of the medical class to deficit all surfaces, as well as the acceptable and lift halls through which it is accessible to our stage.
It seems that the own rules for care are applied with the use of products that ensure the safety of their holders.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we will decide to return.
Our Office in Colombia (DC) is on the WeWork network, which shared with us and all the staff in the DC, its rules with COVID-19.
Last week, our Office in the Columbia circo was fully moved to the remote in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues from New York, we also discussed the issue of the rental in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be released.
Our colleagues first work remotely.
Our elderly colleagues who work remotely know the possibility of correcting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to continue the length of the meetings before one or two hours.
If needed, consider the possibility of breaking them on a course of several days.
You will clearly determine the goal of the meeting, the agenda and the items for the labelling.
Default use video connections, to facilitate interactions and connections, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
In order to please, specify a coordinator, a person who will follow the issues of the chat and control the list of spikers, as well as the responsible for the conduct of notes (or the association).
If necessary, select the technical support for e-mail.
Follow your properties on the Wellness Reimbursement programme when getting a breakfast.
Connect to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to the colleagues about the division.
The HR Operations Command examines the electronic guides available in the form of webers in order to contribute to the efficiency of the work scheduled throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all the recipients of the community to cancel the mass activities made by Wikimedia, such as "editathons", until the WHO announced the end of the pandemia.
We understand and report that our requests for such a cancellation and other repayments may be uncontinued to carry out the fundamental activities, and that no one will be delayed for the delay or change of such objectives.
On the next week, we will take the following activities with additional indications on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
The general opinion in the global community is not only a worry about the interruption of work, but also some feelings of facilitation in relation to interconscience and the opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia, and not only.
As a result, the CRT works on the Meta-Wiki page, which will enhance the space for a community that allows monitoring the impact and community.
We remain in connection with issues with COVID-19
We'll send an invitation to your calendar to a special staff meeting on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we hope that we can share more in the current inquiry, answer your questions and take time together, connecting each other.
We are together in such a situation, and we are ready to help everyone we can.
You can still get information from this electronic record and other important information on COVID-19 from the Wiki Office.
The CRT will update these pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We also work on supporting the rule of communication with the staff in countries that have been significantly affected by the present situation.
In question of easier, business, key stream, information issues or, where necessary, contact with the CRT.
We are ready to support and ensure the relationship as necessary.
In the case of confidentiality problems, please select a email to Brian Judan (Bryan Judan) Director of the International Global Operations.
No such changes should be considered as the refusal of our work and our obligations.
Instead, this is the recognition of the possible need for cardiac new adjustment of our work and obligations.
We believe that such steps are to support each other and to ensure that it is possible to continue, to provide a needed support for our movement and the world with the necessary service.
Our planning work is waiting for the relevant time.
Today, it was time to support each other and to create a space for the importance of the future weeks and perhaps months.
To do so, we need help from each of you; and we need you to forget yourself and your families, and to work with the maximum delivery as soon as that need is.
Now, please, help your hands and don't scare your hands!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and other participants of Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Jane U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angyotensin-converting pharmaceutical 2 (ACE2) is a farm attached to the external surface (cell membranes) of cell cells in arteries, hearts, pockets and boxes.
ACE2 resists the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting farmer (ACE), reduced the content of angiotensin-II and increased it (1-7), making it a multi-promising decision to treat cardiac and medical diseases. It also serves as a point of entry into cells for some coronavirus.
Human farmer version is often mentioned as hACE2.
Angyotensin-converting pharmaceutical 2 is a cyncocontaining metal-ferment divided on the surface of endoteal cells and other cells.
The note ACE2 contains N-end peptidae domain M2 and S-end transport domain of renal aminosil collection.
ACE2 is a single-traditional white type I, and its fermentably active domain falls on the surface of cells and other weights.
ACE2 is removed from the transplanted domain by another pharmaceutical pharmaceutical, and the solvency white received is released in the blood flow and finally with the wheat.
ACE2 is present in most of the organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of the majority of alveo cells of type II, the interocytes of thin kitchen, artery and endoteal cells and the glazing muscle cells of most organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 and RNK is also found in the core of brain, striatum, hypothalamus and brain weapons.
The basic function of the ACE2 is to be expressed as an ACE opposite.
ACE is splitting the hormone of angiotensin I into the conciliating angiotension II.
ACE2, in its part, removes the carbo-conceptive aminosil phenylanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into a vazodilatator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also exhaust a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurotenzine, dinorphine A and graline.
ACE2 also regulates the transportation of the SLC6A19 near-neurral aminosil transport and is present in the Hartnupa disease.
As a transmissible white, ACE2 is the main point of entry into cells for some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus called SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus called COVID-19).
Strengthening was S1 SRS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with a farming domain ACE2 on the surface of cells leads to endocytose and translocation, both virus and endosome farmer.
This entry process also requires a pre-name of the S series protease of the TMPRSS2, which is currently considered as a potential therapy, which led some to think that the reduction of ACE2 levels in cells can help in the fight against infection.
However, many community professionals and regulatory bodies recommend to continue standard therapy by APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to the system of review and meta-analysis on 11 July 2012, “the impact of APF inhibitors was significantly reduced by 34% in comparison with the control group”.
Moreover, “the risk of nerve was also decreased in patients, the receipt of APF inhibitors, which were higher risked by illness of penny, especially patients with advice and heart failure.
The exposure of APF inhibitors has also been associated with a decrease of penalty, although the results were less confidential than in patients with a general risk of penny.’
Recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) is supposed to be a renovate in therapy in heavy damage and apparently improves the current geodynamic and saturation of oxygen with a syndrome of respiratory insufficiency caused by lipopolisharides.
RhACE2 is about 10 hours, and the beginning of the action is 30 minutes, other than 24 hours of effect.
The data are indicated that rhACE2 can be a multi-promising means for people with untransferable classic inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS-inhibitors) or in diseases in which an angiotension II has increased. The rhACE2 has been assessed in clinical trials in the treatment of a strict respiratory distress-syndrome.
The Annexes to COVID-19 are programming applications for mobile phones intended for help in the epidemiological investigation under the 2019-20 coronavir pandemia, namely in the detection of persons ("contacts") that could contact the infected person.
In some regions, annexions officially supported by authorities were distorted or proposed.
There were several options for the monitoring of contacts.
This led a discussion on confidentiality issues, especially on the systems that are on the monitoring of the geografic location of the users of the application.
More slow options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to register the user's nearby to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would unite their efforts to integrate the support of such applications on the basis of Bluetooth directly in their android and iOS operational systems.
In China, the Government with Alipay has extended an application that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, the application called TraceTogether is used.
The annex was disrupted by IT companies, has an open source code and will be transmitted under the Government. The North Seedone has launched the "StopKorona" Annex to Bluetooth, which helps monitor contacts with potentially infected people and provides an operational connection with healthcare bodies.
The Annex was joined by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
By 14 April 2020 the application expected registration in Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that an approximation for contact monitoring was once a final stage and will be available for several weeks. The same applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand consider the possibility of use of applications based on the TraceTogether Syngapore App and BlueTrace Protocol. Russia is using the geozone function, which aims to monitor that patients with COVID-19 diagnosis in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, the Cambridge University, refers to a number of potential practical problems that can arise with the application systems, including false developments and potential inefficiency in the use of only a small part of the population.
Taking into account the concern of the behaviour of the inputs or the "coronaviral" applications, Apple has made a series of organizations that may comply with their applications with coronavirus in App Store, including only "ofa" or other reliable organizations in this translation.
Google and Amazon also introduced similar events.
Participants of the campaign on the protection of confidentiality expressed peace on the effects of the mass monitoring of the population through the Annexes to Coronavirus; in particular, the question was whether the infrastructure of observation would be deteriorated for combating the coronavirus pandemia when the threat was devastated.
Organization of the International Amnesty and more than 100 other organizations op• statement that calls for such supervision.
Organizations announced eight of the public projects:
monitoring should be “legal, proportional and proportional”;
Enlargement of monitoring and monitoring should be subject to reservations for the time of action;
The use of data should be held for the purposes of combating the distribution of the COVID-19;
The safety and anonymity of data should be protected, and the evidence of such protection should be provided;
Digital monitoring should exclude cases of discrimination and marginalisation;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be defined at the level of law;
Protection against misuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of civils to respond to misuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter without Borders) (RSF) should also be ensured as a significant participation.
Google and Apple have a joint plan to solve the problem of constant monitoring, which is to remove the monitoring mechanism from the operational systems of their devices as soon as necessary.
In some countries, a network monitoring of the location is used in place of applications, which excludes the need for the load of the Annex and the possibility of escape.
The networking of the Israelites was approved.
Network solutions that have access to the source of location data also have great potential for confidentiality problems.
However, not all central server systems should have access to local data; a number of systems with confidentiality used by the servers only to connect (see section below).
In South Korea, there was a system that was not used as a basis for contact monitoring.
Instead of using the special application, the system collected information on follow-up from various sources, including the monitoring of mobile devices and transactions with cards, and then prepared them to make notifications in the form of text messages sent by potentially infected.
The Government did not only show this information to warn citizens about potential contacts with infected persons, but also made information on the locality of public access, which has become a result of changes in the Law on the Protection of Information, which had been incurred after the MERS intervention in that country.
A number of applications and websites can be accessed to such information. The countries, including Germany, consider the possibility of using both centralised systems and confidentiality systems.
The details have not been detected until 6 April 2020.
The monitoring of contacts in which confidentiality is a consistent concept, a significant quantity of studies of the literature on which at least 2013 is given. On 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups worked on decisions that provide confidentiality, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register user access to other mobile phones.
However, it is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralised and decentralised approaches and is not a single protocol, where the protocols include a deficiency trace with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols to ensure confidentiality, mobile contact monitoring mechanisms (PACT) and other.
These protocols are responsible for that identifying similar data would never leave the device, but all comparisons on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is being used by SafePaths, forms to ensure confidentiality in collecting and use of data on location or crossing ways to monitor the distribution of COVID-19.
The work of this form in the studies carried out in the document “Apps Gone Rogue: Contenting Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” ("Programmes-Huligans: How to Keep Confidentiality during the Epidemic"), which was held in March 2020. Another similar project is SafeTrace, once the Enigma MPC developing confidentiality technology, which was also initially MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable equipment technology that allows users to exchange confidential data on location and health status with other users and officers without risk of confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, the groups dividing the same approach and using similar protocols was a global TCN coalition, aimed at reducing the fragmentation and ensuring the global compatibility of the applications for monitoring and notification, which is the key factor of their broad distribution.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official application.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies who control the phone forms Android and iOS, announced the initiative to monitor contacts that, as they claimed, provide confidentiality and which is based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography to maintain confidenciality.
They also address the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system must be expanded in three steps:
Enlargement of instruments allowing governments to establish an application to monitor the predictment of the citizens ' coronary, but to maintain data confidentiality
By integrating this function directly in iOS and Android, Google and Apple are planning to solve problems with continuous monitoring, dreaming the system through the update of the operational system, and then removed it as soon as the threat was devastated.
Reposition of medicines (as well as reprofiling, redirecting, change of tasks or therapy) is the reprofilation of a medicinal product in order to treat sickness or medical condition, which is significantly prescribed in the case of disease.
It is one of the directions of scientific studies that are currently used to repeat safe and effective treatment methods for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of reconciliation plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 whites, subject to the effect of medicines, each of which has a few ligands.
The analysis of these parties is a suitable basis for enhancement of effective antiviral antiviral anti-viral medicine against white COVID-19.
The most important white mixtures for SARS-CoV-2 – papain-like protease, CNR depending on polymerase, helikopter, white S and ADF-ribofosfatase.
Hussein AA and the co-operators in their document studied several candidate units that were then optimized and analyzed their comparison with the most approved medicines in order to enhance the high efficient treatment against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical studies.
Chlorokine is an opposite medicine, which is also used in the treatment of some autoimmunal diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chlorokine and hydrochlorokine with it would be the number of four medicines studied in the ‘Solidarity’ test.
The Governor of New York Andrew Kuomo announced that the tests of chlorokin and hydrochlorokin would be started in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA allowed the use of hydrochlorokin sulphate and chlorokin phosphate with extreme application permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved in the process of the clinical tests of the FDA and was allowed in EUA only as an experimental treatment for immediate assistance in hospitalized patients but cannot be treated in clinical trials.
The CDC stated that “the order of use, dose or duration of hydroxychlorokin for profiling or treatment of SARS-CoV-2” has not yet been established.
The doctors say that they use medicines when "no other output".
The Turkish Research Group in Stambul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorokine in combination with cincs and vitamins A, C and D.
Great studies are conducted at the University of Duke and the University of Oxford.
The Medical School of the New York University in Langone examines the safety and efficiency of hydroxychlorokin.
China's clinical trials in Uchan and Shanghai showed that the favipivir is “unexpectedly effective”.
35 patients in Shanghjan who had taken this medicine had received a negative result in a average of 4 days, while 45 patients who had not received the medicine were 11 days.
The Uchan studies were conducted in the course of 240 patients with pneumonia, half of which was obtained of favipivir, and second half of the umifenovir.
The Italian pharmacist’s knowledge of the public was that the results of the efficiency of the medicinal product were sorrowful and should not be considered to be.
On 2 April, Germany announced that he would purchase the medicine in Japan to fill his stocks and to deliver it to university hospitals, where the medicine will be used to treat patients with COVID-19, military resources.
According to the South China Morning Post, Sino Abe reported to the Trump administration the possibility of purchasing the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in cases of disease.
His use may be unsafe for breast-feeding patients or for patients trying to change.
The results of an investigation dedicated to the combination of antiviral drugs “lopinavir” and “ritonavir” (Kaletra) were concluded that “no medicine efficiency has been detected”.
The medicines were repeated to inhibit HIV replication by association with protease.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify medicines to find a combination associated with SARS-CoV-2 protease. The scientific community criticizes the reprofiling of medicines specially developed for HIV and IDA.
WHO included a combination of lopinavire and ritonavire in the international “Solidarity” test.
Remdesivir was created once in Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola and Marburg Virus Infections. Following Gilead Sciences, the Rendesivir found that the antiviral activity in vitro in the area of filo, pneumonia, paramix and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is developing resistence through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and transfers.
In the early studies, Rendesivir can have a high genetic barrier to resist, which is currently conducted a few clinical trials, including two university clinics of Cleveland; one is conducted in patients with moderate disease, and another in patients with more difficult form.
Three clinical tests are currently carried out for the internal introduction of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized in a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without the use of placebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, the test of antibiotic asylum was started in New York.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medical Health (CGM) plans to carry out an Alvesco (Ésoneida) study of the Tedgin, the Ingalation Corticosteroid for the treatment of astma, in order to be used in the treatment of patients infected by a new coronavirus.
Stage II, the form of angiotensin-converting farmer 2, is conducted with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe diseases in order to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Manufacturers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiac and Justice diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of the cold in reducing fuel and complexity in patients with the symptoms of COVID-19.
COLCORONA was invited to investigate 6000 adults in 40 years of age with COVID-19 with symptoms that were not required hospitalisation.
Feeding breasts and non-effective anticipations may not be able to participate in the investigation.
There are several coagulants in Italy.
The low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encouraged the Italian pharmaceutical knowledge to repeat recommendations on the use of this medicine.
On 14 April, Italy has been reported a lot of studies with > 300 patients dedicated to the use of enoxaparin in prophylactic and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a significant scientific attention was focused on the reprofiling of approved antiviral medicines, which were repeated for previous epidemies such as MERS, SARS and the virus of the Western Nile.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for treatment with COVID-19 in 7th of the Chinese recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in 7th of the Chinese recommendations
Antybiotics, which have been recognised potentially appropriate for use as the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6): approved in China.
Also trials in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccine is a hypotetic vaccine against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed on clinical trials, many trials of such vaccine continue to be done.
At the end of February 2020, World Health Protection (WHO) stated that it did not expect vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to be able to get earlier than 18 months later.
In April, five candidates for vaccine on safety studies in stage I.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, the major intensity of this disease was spread throughout the world, which led to significant investment once the vaccine and investigation of its activities.
Many organizations used upgraded genes to repeat vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key tasks of CEPI's vaccine initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production powers, extension and global access.
In April, the CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, in the investigation phase and times, there were 10 different technological forms for creating effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the forms included in the safety studies of Stage I:
Nuclear acid (DNA and RNK) (with phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRC-1273)
Virus vector (with stage I and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologycs, adeonaviral vector type 5)
As told by the CEPI in April, 115 potential vaccines are on early stages of time, 78 of them are used in active projects (79, according to the Institute of Milken); further, 37 more vaccines were stated, but there are little general information (of course they are at the planning stage or once).
In phases I-II, preliminary safety and immunogenity tests are conducted, as usually randomized, placebo-controlled and in several parts with one-time definition of more precise and effective doses.
Stage III of trials is usually covered by more participants, including the control group; the medicines are tested for effectiveness in preventing disease and are at the same time followed by side effects in optimal doses.
From 79 vaccines actively available (after the beginning of April 2020), 74 are still not on human tests (all are still on the stages of doclinical studies).
On 24 January 2020, the Queensland University, Australia, announced that it was investigating the potential of vaccine with molecular heat, which geneticly modified viral whites to stimulate immune reaction.
On 24 January 2020, the International Vaccin Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the Saskachevan University, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine in 2021.
On 26 January 2020 and at the Hong Kong University of 28 January, was also announced on the beginning of vaccine projects.
On 29 January 2020, Janssen’s pharmaceutical companies, headed by Hanake Switchmaker, announced the beginning of their vaccine creation.
Janssen, together with his biotechnology partner, develops oral vaccine.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced productive partnership with Vaxart for a time of vaccine.
OncoGen laboratory in Romania on 8 February 2020 opened the document on the time of the technology vaccine that was used for vaccination against cancer neo-antigen.
On 25 March, the Scientific Research Chapter of the Institute announced the end of the vaccine synthesis and the start of tests.
On 27 February 2020, the subsidiary company Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-O, announced that it started a project of peptide vaccine Ii-Key against COVID-19.
Their goal was to repeat the vaccine medicines that could be protested on people in 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, the Washington University in St. Louis announced its projects once a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army for Medical Research and Material Insurance, Fort-Detrick, and Scientific Research, the Walter Rid Army Institute, Silver-Spring, located in the western part of Maryland, declared that they develop their vaccine.
On 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered in partnership with Novax Inc.
For the time of vaccination and production.
Partners also announced plans for clinical trials and testing at stage I by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that even in the current regime, at least half-two years of vaccine will be required.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, the biotechnological company, Quebec, reported that, in part, the Canadian Institute for Health Research on them was created a part like the coronavirus.
The potential vaccine is conducted in laboratory studies, and testing on people is planned for July or August 2020.
The Guardian reported earlier that the President of the United States Donald Trump proposed CureVac for exclusive access to Covid-19 vaccine, against which the Government of Germany expressed its protest.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced the conclusion of a partnership with the German BioNTech for a joint vaccine on the basis of IRC.
BNT162 is a vaccine candidate based on IRC; the medicine is currently conducting clinical tests and clinical tests will be started in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, the Italian biotechnological company Takis Biotech announced that it would have results of clinical trials in April 2020, and that their vaccine candidate can be tested on people already.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Epidemia (CEPI), France announced investment of 4.9 million dollars in a consortium of COVID-19, participating in the Institute Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vena, Austria) and the University of Pi’sburg.
Other investment partners of the CEPI once a vaccine from COVID-19 I are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, Hong Kong Universities, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health operators declared that scientists began testing six different animal vaccine candidates.
The Imperial College Researchers, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they developed the self-employed NCV vaccine from COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was used once during 14 days after receipt of the success from China.
On the end of March, the Canadian Government announced that there were 275 million Canadian dollars for 96 medical contest projects against COVID-19, including a number of vaccine candidates in Canada companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskachevan.
Similarly at the same time, the Canadian Government announced that 192 million Canadian dollars were especially for vaccine against COVID-19, as well as for the plans for the establishment of a national " vaccine bank", where several new vaccines could be used in the case of a new crownvirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the PittCoVacc University of Medical School reported the PittCoVacc testing potential vaccine against COVID-19 on mouse, saying that “MNA introduced sub-education vaccines SARS-CoV-2 S1, calling on responses to antigen-specific anticipants [mouse] which had been shown within 2 weeks after immunisation”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Farmaceutic School of the Waterloo University announced a potential vaccine on the basis of DNA, which may be in the form of narrow break.
With the DNA bacteria, it will be multiplied inside the bacteria and developed without viral similar parts that can stimulate the immune system to you against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three United States universities united IBM supercomputer resources in comparison with the hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google resources.
Vaccines have geological effects also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other privileges other than the properties of preventing diseases.
Another randomized investigation conducted in Australia includes 4170 health careers.
The vaccines that are developed may be insecure or ineffective.
Earlier studies on the evaluation of the efficiency of vaccine using animal models, for which COVID-19 is characterized, such as ACE2-transgenic mouse, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for measures to maintain biosecurity infections with live viruses and international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were protested on animal models.
In 2020, there are no medicines or protection vaccines that would be safe and effective for people for treatment with SARS.
According to the studies of 2005 and 2006, the identity of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of athic penality was a priority for governments and public health institutions worldwide, and there is also no controlled vaccine against MERS.
When MERS started to spread, the SARS study that was conducted at that moment could be a standard for vaccine and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, one (based on DNA) vaccine from MERS passed by stage I of clinical trials on people, and three other vaccines, all of which were vaccines based on a virus vector and were in the process of repeat, two adonovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-Vector (MVA-MERS-S).
The theory of the negotiation was extended in the networks, acknowledging that the COVID-19 virus is no new and that the vaccine already exists.
Implementations in networks cited the words of some patients who claimed to be patented on the genetic follow-up of other coronavirus coronavirus, such as SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these stamps.
Coronavirus is a disease discovered in 2019 (COVID-19), which is a infectious illness caused by a severe respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most exposed symptoms include disorder, elder and breathing difficulties.
Other symptoms may include the feeling of calmness, muscle pain, diary, hair pain, loss of ovulation and pain in life.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the sickness is usually about five days, but it may also be different from two to fourteen days.
Most of the cases are the symptoms of symptoms, but in some cases, the disease is overwhelmed in viral penality and polyorganic insufficiency.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million infections in 210 countries and regions were registered, and more than 153.000 were lost from this disease.
More than 568,000 people have been healthy, and the virus is mainly distributed in close contact with each other, often through microscopic capsules that are distributed in air at ≥ , chicken , or .
Though these capsules are shaped by exhaust, they usually represent a threat to land or to surface, but they are not transferred by air in large distances.
People are also injured by injury of a contaminated surface, and then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is the most infected during the first three days after the symptoms appeared, although its distribution may be ≥ before the symptoms and at more deteriorated stages. The standard diagnosis method is a polymerate heat reaction with the reverse transcription in real time (RT-PCR) to the model taken as well as the weapons of the nasoglote.
Medical masks are recommended for patients with suspicion of illness and those who care for them.
Recommendations on the use of medical masks are different: some sciences recommend not to use them, some recommend their use, and others require it.
Currently, the treatment of vaccine or specific COVID-19 is not available.
The local distribution of disease was registered in most countries in all six regions of the WHO.
Infections may not have any symptoms or have symptoms of influenza, such as swimming, stumbling, and images.
Extreme symptoms include distressed breathing, persistent pain or feeling of depression in the breast, consciousness, distress with awakening, seating or lips; if the above-numerated symptoms are present, it should immediately be addressed for medical assistance.
The symptoms of the disease of the breathing paths, such as kissing, disorder or pain in the neck, can be observed.
There are also different percentages of iron-coated symptoms such as heat, fluid and diarrhoea.
The cases of illness registered in China proved primarily only to feel depressed in the breast and shared heartfall.
In some cases, sickness can progress by developing a polyorganic insufficiency, and then death.
This is called an incubation period.
The incubation period COVID-19 is usually five and six days, but it may be different from two to 14 days.
The symptoms of 97.5 per cent of people begin to be shown within 11.5 days after the infection, and, according to the data, the symptoms are not all infected.
The role of such unsensitive carriers in the transmission of diseases is still not fully, but predict the data testify that they can contribute to the distribution of infections.
The percentage of infected persons with an unsynthetic illness is currently unknown, it is only being studied; therefore, the Korean monitoring and profiling centres of disease (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all in the cases and hospitalisations of virus diseases were insensitive.
Since 1 April, the National Health Committee began to include unsimptological events; from 166 cases of infection registered on that day, 130 (78%) were rejected in the testing.
And the mocrote, and the slip can have a big face of virus.
In the sound of the air, there is more capsules than normal volume.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that the caps could be extended at a distance of 4,5 meters (15 meters).
The virus is usually not translated by airway, but the National Scientific Academy suggested that the transmission of parts of the virus into bio-aerodrome, and that the air testing by the air collectors resolved in the corridors of the people's coming parts showed the identity of the virus NCB.
• Medical procedures such as intubation and heart-leaving reanimation (CRL) can lead to breathing and thus spread the virus in air.
There are also fears that the virus can be spread through phecalia, however, the risk is considered low. The virus is the most contagious when humans are symptoms; the spread of virus is possible until symptoms appear, but this is small.
The collaborators of the Centre of Profile and Control of Disasters (ECDC) claim that it is not clear how easily the virus is spread, however, that one disease normally affects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that the virus was able to live on the carton surface during one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on the non-stat (AISI 304) until three days, and 99% of the earlier surfaces up to 4 hours.
However, these indicators varied depending on heat and temperature.
The wheat and the mechanisms in the proper use have a sufficient effect in combating the infection: the wheat distorts the green protection of virus, which is thus ensuring it and is able to remove it from the top of the skin and other surfaces of the skin.
Other solutions, such as benzalconychloride and chloride, are less effective against this virus.
Five of the six first tests showed the highest blood virus, and the sixth patient was found the highest blood virus content for the second day of testing.
The severe heavy respiratory coronavir syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe heavy coronaviral respiratory syndrome, first found in three persons with penemony from a group of severe respiratory diseases registered in Uhana.
All signs of the new virus SARS-CoV-2 are also met in the family of coronavirus.
Without the body, the virus is a vital muscle that covers its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 closely with originating SARS-CoV.
Easy is a body that is most affected by COVID-19, since the virus is in the cells of household through an angiotensin-converting ferment 2 (ACE2), which is most exposed to alveo-cells of type II.
The virus is combined with ACE2 and is entered into a host cell using the character of glycoprotein - "shipa" (peplomer).
12 per cent of infected people, who went to the hospital in Uhana, have been diagnosed with a severe myocardious damage, which is often faced with a severe form of disease.
The frequency of heart-conscious symptoms is high because of systemic reaction and immune system infringements, monitoring in the progress of disease, but a heavy miocard damage can also be identified by ACE2 recipients in the heart.
ACE2 recipients are in the heart in great numbers because they participate in the body.
The high thrombosis frequency (31 per cent) and venosa trombocy (25 per cent) was observed in patients with COVID-19 and could be testified of unfortunate prognoses. The autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 was a result of diffusional alveo damage (DAD) and limfocytocontainers.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a tropism to the ACE2-expressive epiterial cells of respiratory paths, the symptoms of system hypersensitivity are observed in patients with hard-term COVID-19.
In particular, it was found that Patogenic GM-KSF T cells were corrected with recycling of IL-6 monocytes and severe pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Limfocitar infiltrates were also found in the case of the covering.
The WHO also repeated several testing protocols on this disease.
The polymerate heat reaction in real time (RT-PCR) is a standard testing method.
The test is usually conducted on respiratory samples obtained by the nasoglotic fat, but it can also be used to use the weapons of the nose or the mocrote.
Results are usually ready for several hours to two days.
Blood analysis may also be taken, but they require two blood tests taken in two weeks and their results have no direct value.
Chinese scientists have succeeded to determine the coronavirus stamp and to repeat its genetic consequences so that scientists around the world can automatically develop tests with the method of polymerate heat reaction (CPC) to detect this virus.
At the time of 4 April 2020, tests on an anticipation that could find the presence of infection at the current time and the fact of possible infection in the past have been seen at a stage of times, but have not yet been distributed.
The Chinese studies of test data showed that their accuracy consists of only 60-70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the Office of Food Quality and Medicines (FDA) approved the first test for diagnostics, authorised its application at the end of this month. The diagnostic indications issued by the Uganda University of Juan, indicated the methods of detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
The bilateral multidose of the suburbs of the “math glass” focus with peripheric, asymmetrical and aposterial distribution is often the symptoms found at the early stage of disease.
Sub-formal domination, the symptom of the bullshit (delicate disturbance with variable alveo completement) and consolidation are developed as far as the disease progress progresses.
There are few data on microscopic disorders and pathophysology COVID-19.
Basic results of the pathological investigation carried out on:
Roscope: Pleverity, Pericardite, Evolution and Features
Four types of severity of virus pneumatics can be observed:
Pneumonia: Pneumonia, pneumonia hyperplasy, major atypic pneumonia, interstitial burning with limfocytary infiltration and education of multi-electric igant cells
Difficult alveo damage (DAD) with diffusional alveo exhaust.
DAD is the cause of strict respiratory distress-syndrome (ORDS) and heavy hypocaemia.
Exploitant pneumonia: exhausts in alveo and interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Diffusion of internal justice (DVS syndrome); lycoerithroplastic reaction
Prophylactic measures to reduce the probability of infection include residence in the house, avoiding humans, the frequency mixing of hands with milk and water for at least 20 seconds, the follow-up of breathing hygiene rules, as well as the avoiding touching the eyes, the nose or the mouth with unmatched hands.
The CDC recommends to cover the mouth and nose with a salpet on or by a shipping, or, if there is no salpet, to cover the mouth and nose on the interior side of the locking zone of the hand.
Following a halt or a cup, a qualified hygiene procedure is recommended.
The Centre for Control and Profile of Disabilities (CDC) recommends that weighing face masks in public places, in particular in order to transfer infections to unsimptous diseases. The distance strategy aims to reduce contacts of patients infected with large groups of people; schools and enterprises were closed in the framework of these measures, the movement of citizens and major public activities were cancelled.
Recommendations on Distance also included that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) each other.
No medicines with efficiency against COVID-19 are available. Since the end of the vaccine is expected not before 2021, the main part of the COVID-19 diminishes the epidemic epidemy, which is “out of the plate”.
The CDC also recommends to swim hands with milk and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or when a strong arm is contaminated, and before eating and after smoking, ≥ or swimming.
The CDC also recommends the use of dezinfecting spirt contents (spert contents at least 60 per cent) for hands, but only in cases of milk and water not available. The WHO provides two receptors for the production.
In these compositions, tenol or isopropanol are used with antimicrobial activity.
Hydrocarbons are used to remove bacteria in the spider and is not a suitable means for the antisepte of hands.
Glycerol is added as an engineer.
Patients have shown supporting therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, as well as support of other life-related organs.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that the virus is infected carry a normal medical mask.
The extremely corporal memorandum on the gender (ECMO) was expected to solve the problem of respiratory insufficiency, but its advantages are still being examined.
In order to strengthen immunity, it is recommended that the rules of personal hygiene, healthy life and diet be respected.
Supporting therapy methods can be shown to patients with easily symptoms at early stages of disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China op•Recommendations for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive therapy and pulmonologists have collected therapeutic recommendations for various free resource institutions — IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment with COVID-19.
In order to treat symptoms as the first line medicine, some medical agents recommend to make a choice for the use of paracetamol (acetaminofen) compared to ibuprofene.
In order to minimize the risk of transmission of virus, especially in medical agencies, it is necessary to take precautions in the course of procedures in which air-capped emissions, such as intubation or sucking of hands.
The COVID-19 medical architects recommend that the COVID-19 CDC be placed in the air-capital isolator (AIIR) as an additional measure, other than the standard precautions for contacts and air. The CDC recommended the use of individual protection (SIDA) during the pendemy.
Recommended individual protection means: protective chalat, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical sticks. The above means are more preferable to use respirators than medical masks.
N95 respirators have been approved for use under industrial conditions, but the FDA has allowed the use of these respirators with an exceptional application authorisation (EUA).
They are intended to protect parts of air, such as air, but no efficiency is guaranteed in use in order to protect the specifics of the biological agent.
If the medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends to use and protect your face screens or, at least, to make the masks automatically under home conditions.
In most cases, the COVID-19 fluctuation form is not sufficient to require experimental ventilation of or its alternative, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with a respiratory insufficiency with COVID-19 is currently actively studied, with some evidence that intubations can escape with an intensive air stream or two-level local pressure in the breastways.
Until it is not possible whether any of these two ways for patients in critical state is the same effective as the IFL.
The doctors make a choice for an invasive mechanism of ventilation, if available, because this method is strictly distributing parts in the air compared to the narrow channel with the intensive air flow. The risk of severe disease for elderly people (though more than 60 years old, and especially those aged 80 years) is higher.
In many developed countries, there are no hospital cooks for the population, and the resources of health systems are too large to cope with a close increase in COVID-19 in a difficult form of hospitalization.
Following an investigation in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive therapy, 2.5 per cent needed to support ventilation work and 1.4 per cent ended.
Approximately 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 finally fall into realities in China.
The task to ensure experimental ventilation is complicated, since the intense respiratory distress (ARDS), developed in COVID-19, and the gender is more difficult.
IVL with support for breathing pressure and DPCV is to provide the maximum quantity of oxygen in the cotton and to ensure their minimum ventilation damage, which can result in the development of pneumotorex.
The high DCV may not be available in the early models of ventilators.
The studies of potential treatment methods were started in January 2020, and some antiviral medicines are currently at the stage of clinical trials.
The most perpetuous is the reddesivir.
Once new medicines may be extended until 2021, some of the tested medicines have already been approved for other purposes or are at the latest trials.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in patients with severe disease.
WHO's recommended volunteers participate in tests of effectiveness and safety of potential treatment methods. The FDA provides a temporary authorisation for the use of reconciliation plasma as a experimental treatment in cases where human life threatens serious or direct risks.
It was not subject to clinical studies that should be carried out to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched an adjustment intended to combat rapid disease.
The users should enter their name and identification number to enter.
The Annex may find “a close contact” using observation data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user may also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application recommends not only self-isolation, but also sends information to health authorities. An analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, person recognition technology, mobile monitoring and experienced intellectuality is used to follow infected people and persons with whom they are contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security bodies to follow the data of the mobile phones of people who were probably infected by the coronavirus.
The measures were taken to ensure the care and protection of persons who could be contacted with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent Deutsche Telekom's virus before the Federal State Agencies of Germany and the Robert Koha Institute, the aggregated data on the location of citizens.
In Russia, the recognition technology of persons was introduced for the detection of rates.
The Regional Health Authority of Italy, Julio Galler, reported that center network operators reported that “40 per cent of people are still moved in the territory”.
The Government of Germany has conducted a 48-hour schedule for outcome days, in which more than 42.000 participants were involved.
The President of Estonia, Carsti Caluliad, also, invited to seek creative decisions against the distribution of the coronavir.
People may experience stress in terms of karantine, forestation, side effects of treatment or fear of self-infection.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor's words: "The strengthened isolation, unity, health care, stress and economic disaster is a idea of the conditions for the provision of dogs' health and the welfare of people."
Sickness may easily occur with small or missing symptoms reminding other spread diseases of respiratory paths such as normal prostitution.
Patients with a easy form of disease are normally healthy during two weeks while treating patients with severe or critical forms may be required from three to six weeks.
The women concerned may have a higher risk of receipt of the COVID-19 hard form of other viruses such as SARS and MERS, although there are no such data on COVID-19. Some COVID-19 people may be affected as a complexity.
Persons with the most difficult period of COVID-19 disease may quickly progress in an intense respiratory distress (ARDS), which cause respiratory insufficiency, septic shock or polyorganic insufficiency.
COVID-19 complications include sepsis, anonymous trombocytation, as well as problems with heart, pockets and sands.
Trombocytical anomalia, particularly the increase in protrobine time, was described in 6% of patients, went to the hospital with COVID-19, while 4% of this group was observed.
Approximately 20 to 30% of patients with COVID-19 are increased in feedingstuffs (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalisation and death in patients translated into intensive therapy was seven days.
According to the cases of disease at the early stage, the average time from the initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range between six and 41 days.
According to the investigation carried out by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the level of employment among men of 2.5.8% and 1.7% of women.
Histopatological studies on patterns testify of different alveo injury to cell fibromicsoid exhausts in both of them.
Virus cytopatic changes were observed in pneumatics.
The appearance of easily reminded of an intense respiratory distress-syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8 per cent of the cases registered by the National Health Commission of China, the problems with heart were increasing the level of troponine or the rest of heart.
According to the data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems.
Assessments of employment depending on the situation are varied from such regional differences and from methodological work.
Insufficient efficient calculation of cases in easily form may lead to increased levels.
However, the fact that death occurs as a result of the diseases obtained in the past may indicate that the current level of employment is not assessed.
COVID-19 severe symptoms were generally developed at 1.4 times, and those patients had about 2.4 times often needed intensive treatment or died compared to non-corruptible patients.
The administration of one of the Hong Kong clinics discovered that some patients who were healthy from this disease were reduced to 20-30 per cent and that their scan was injured.
After healing, this can also lead to the ‘After intensive therapy’ syndrome.
In March 2020, it was not possible to produce a sustainable immunity against the patient's health.
In view of other coronavirus, it is considered likely, but it was also reported that after the COVID-19 healing, the coronavir tests were still local.
In these cases, it is considered that there was a deteriorated period of disease and not a repeated infection.
The virus is deemed natural, animal origin and is a infectious disease.
The fact that the origin of the virus was not, but the distribution of the infection was almost completely stated by human transfers to humans until December 2019.
The first 41 cases under COVID-19, on January 2020 in The Lancet, calls on 1 December 2019 on the early date of the first case of disease.
According to the official data of the WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
A number of methods are usually used for quantity.
All numbers are varied depending on the region and the time of the illness, and are also affected by testing volumes, the quality of health systems, the quality of the treatment schemes, from the beginning of the emergency of disease and the population's parameters, such as the age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO has been diagnosed with the NCB-10: U07.1 in cases of death under laboratory infection SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for death from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory infection of SARS-CoV-2. The number of infections and infections is the number divided by diagnosed cases during a certain period.
According to the statistical data of Johns Hopkins University, the total number of infections and infections consists of 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) at 17 April 2020.
This number varies depending on the region. Other methods include the definition of the coefficient of disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients, finally results of disease, as well as the definition of the coefficient results of transmissible infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (as diagnosed and non-diagnosed cases) and ends the result of disease.
These statistical data are not linked to a specific time and reflect the indicators of a certain level of population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Despite not all patients who have been infected, such antenders can understand how many people have been infected.
In the epoch of the emergency in Italy, Castillone d'Adda, a small village with 4600 people, 80 people (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the town of Gangelt, the disease was spread in the festival of karnaval among youths, causing a far less importance, and not all cases of death from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Furthermore, the healthcare system of Germany was not affected.
In Netherlands, approximately 3 per cent of the population may have an anticipation, judged by donor blood indicators.
COVID-19 is an official cause of 69 cases (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemia and the levels of differentity for men and women.
According to the investigations carried out in China and Italy, the level of men is above.
The highest risk group is men in age more than 50 years; the breakdown between men and women is only reduced from 90 years of age.
China has a level of ≥ 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The accurate reasons for this disappointment are not, but can be included in genetic and behavior factors.
Gender immunological differences, reduced smoking among women associated with male diseases (e.g. hypertension in men in a younger age than women) may cause a higher ability among men.
57 per cent of men were infected, and 72 per cent of the death of COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the Government of the United States does not provide gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific studies showed that virus diseases such as Ebola, HIV, grip and ORVI have different gender statistics.
The majority of health careers, especially the nurse staff, constitutes women, respectively, more opportunities to infect them.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Protection announced the official name of this disease — COVID-19.
Mr. Tedros Adhan Gabeisus explains: “CO” means “corona”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” is “life” (disease), and 19 is the first year when the first discovery was found: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid a specific geographical location (e.g. China), species of animals or groups of people, as required by the nomination recommendations aimed at preventing achievement. The virus, which is called COVID-19, is called a severe coronaviral syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO's public reports further use the terms "COVID-19" and "virus responsible for COVID-19".
And sickness, and the virus itself usually calls "coronavirus".
During the initial emergency in Uhana, China, virus and disease were usually called "coronavirus" and "uhank coronavirus".
In January 2020, in 2015's recommendations on the use of geographical diseases and viruses, the WHO recommended to use the terms “water respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names of virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, the Office of the Names were repeated: "COVID-19" and "SARS-CoV-2".
Because of the volumes of the standard tissues of supplies, some digital printing services manufacturers are medical materials, such as tampons to take fats from the nose, as well as details of the IVL equipment.
In one of these cases, the Italian clinic was urgently needed in the ventilation band, and the supplier was not able to deliver it for the time required, then one of the productions was reprofiled and smoke to print 100 locks per night.
After the first exhibition of the COVID-19, the Internet was highly disseminated with various theories of interview, designation and feeding information about the origin of virus, its scales, profile, treatment and others.
People may probably affect other animals’ virus.
The results of the studies did not confirm the distribution of virus between sugars, wheat and chips.
There is no approved vaccine from virus or medicinal products for treatment.
Government, academic groups and researchers are currently conducted in various areas of vaccine and medicines from COVID-19.
In March of the WHO, the SOLIDARITY Trial programme (SOLIDARNOST Test), aimed at evaluating the effect of four associations, considers the most effective today.
Prepared vaccine does not exist yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine medicinal products.
As well as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 falls into human cells using ACE2, the results of previous studies are therefore used in scientific times by SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccines.
First, researchers are trying to create a full-viral vaccine.
The effort of such virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at providing a rapid human immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
Secondly, the establishment of subventive vaccine is to create a vaccine, which increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain virus subsistents.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are addressed to the distortion of the S-shiro-video, which helps the virus to enter the ACE2 farmer.
Thirdly, this is a time of vaccine based on nuclear acid (DNA or CNV vaccine, new vaccine creation methodology).
Experience of vaccines on any of these shall be checked on safety and efficiency. On 16 March 2020, the first clone of vaccine on four volunteers started in Sietle.
The vaccine contains no genetic code copied from the virus that causes illness, and an antilosive strength was indicated as one of the potential problems once a vaccine from SARS-COV-2, but it has a significant character.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials were carried out.
The medicines approved for the treatment of maya have been under seven trials, four of these studies were in hydrochlorokine or chlorokine.
The reprofiling of antiviral medicines consists of most Chinese studies; at the end of April, nine studies were conducted in the phase III of reddesivir at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of the vaccine and the COVID-19-treatment medicines was carried out. To this end, there are also several other antiviral medicines for the treatment of COVID-19, including reddesivir, chlorokine and hydrochlorokine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
In March 2020, data on the efficiency of the remedixive are provided.
The clinical improvement was observed in patients, receiving reddexivir as an exception.
Stage III of clinical trials is already conducted in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chlorokine, previously used for the treatment of maya, was considered in China in February 2020, and the results were preliminary.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
Corean and China healthcare bodies recommend to carry out chlorokine.
The Uchan Institute of Virusology recommends a single dose in one gram, but notes that the duplication of this dose is very dangerous and can lead to the summer origin.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an extensive use of hydrochlorokine and chlorokine to monitor patients treated with COVID-19. The Chinese indications also indicated that interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir is a means against COVID-19.
The data preview indicates that the high doses of ribavirin are for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for a detailed in vivo study demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low conversions. The studies showed that the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the ACE2 receptor needed to be taken by a ship of transmembered protease series 2 (TMPRSS2).
Surveys of the use of chlorokine and hydrochlorokine with acidor or without it have serious effects that do not allow the medical community to use these treatment methods without a detailed study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unexpected.
Hypercytokinemy may be caused as a complication in the outer stages of the COVID-19 hard form.
As a result of a small investigation conducted by the National Health Commission of China, the recommendation on the treatment of coronavir was tocylisumab.
This medicinal product was 2 steps of non-randomized test conducted at the national level in Italy, after the results of its use in patients with severe disease.
In accordance with the analysis of ferritine blood in order to detect cytokine tempesty, it is intended to resist those factors that, as it seems, become a cause of death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA was approved by antagonist of the interlacin-6 recipient on the basis of retro-thematic studies for the treatment of steroid refractive cytokines, which caused by another CAR T-cell therapy.
Today, there are no randomized and controlled evidence of that tocilizumab is a effective means to treat cytokine release syndrome.
The transfer of cleaned and horsed antidepreciations produced by immune systems of patients from COVID-19 is currently considered as a non-vaccinous passive immunisation method.
This test was tested in the treatment of patients from SARS, but its results were uncertain.
The neutralization of virus is a expected effect with which the passive treatment of anticipants can ensure protection from SARS-CoV-2.
However, use and other mechanisms such as anti-titolous cell citoto and/or fagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive therapy with ancients, such as the use of monoklonal anticorps, are on a stage of times.
Increase can be increased the use of reconciliated blood sugar, which consists of a weight of blood-healing symptoms of patients and contains anti-virus anticipation.
Coronaviral diseases, high-like syndrome group
Le Venilan, the doctor of the Uhanian central clinic, who later was infected and died from COVID-19 after reporting the distribution of virus.
