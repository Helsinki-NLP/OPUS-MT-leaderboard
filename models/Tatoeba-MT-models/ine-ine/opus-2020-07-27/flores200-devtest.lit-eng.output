Everyone participates in the public life and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, you are rarely listening to sorrows for water quality or driving pools.
Why are transport systems taking such goods as they experience problems every day, or are transport engineers simply incomplete? Or maybe the problem is more fundamental?
The travel flow shall be subject to the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction.
Unfortunately, the running stream is adequate because it cannot be intended for a hundred percent of drivers' behaviour.
It is good that the drivers are walking quite equally on the road, so the running flows have a certain coherence and can be approximately calculated matematically.
In order to better translate the run stream, determine three main characteristics of the connection: 1) screen, 2) screen, and 3) speed.
These relations help to plan, design and exploit road infrastructure.
