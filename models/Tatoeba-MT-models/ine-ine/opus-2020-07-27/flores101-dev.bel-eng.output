Thanks to this graph, it turns the rotation. When the cancles are moved to the right, the image rotates the right side. At the right side, it moves to the left.
To return the earlier energy level, they need to avoid the energy weights obtained from the light.
That's why they release a small part of the light, called "foton".
The Scientific Name of this process is "induced emissions" because light light stimulates the atmosphere, the emission of light fatone, and the light is one of the types of exhibition.
