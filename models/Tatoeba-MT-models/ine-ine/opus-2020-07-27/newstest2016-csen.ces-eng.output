The professor admitted that he had shot his girlfriend
During calling on a nausea line, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and needed to come home to them.
Lamb intended that his "sweet dog" was home alive and probably disappointed, and that contacts with the family of a dead woman can be found on her phone.
Inside the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and the manually written message on the white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I want to return it, I loved Amy and she was the only one who loved me," was in the letter that Lamb signed according to the offices.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who made two shoes online for Delta State in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to the school campus where the police thought he had shot the favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
The police officer in Delta State, Lynn Buford, said that university staff heard shoot at 10:18 afternoon.
The lamb seemed to have made a phone on the neck line soon after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for.
The day after the shooting at school, students and faculties made a hiding behind the closed doors, the trusted authorities still try to treat the motivation of Lambo.
The details published by researchers from the state, students and employees who knew him together created a picture of a talented, but probably a problem factor.
Students confirmed that they were happy with his lessons.
The police in Gıer, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no record in the criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote, to thank the "good people" with which he shared the academic life.
Both learned at the social faculty and story together with 17 other college members and many students went on the schools at the same time.
Inclination has also occurred in the case of problems.
The student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed to be aggressive and distracted, "as something wouldn't be wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, noted that Lamb told him that he was struggling with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb already asked Delta State for free from health careers when he said he had a problem.
And this year he learned only two online shoes.
Recent changes on the collection of university employees indicated that the doctor that Lamb was strongly working would not give him the automatic employment period to become a professor assistant.
President of the University William LaForge said he didn't know any conflict between Lambe and Schmidt, but "Mrs. Lamba was probably suffering."
Lamb's not going to answer these questions anymore.
After he went out of the campus, the police arrested his trailer when he crossed the border of the Arkansas state back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed the only shot of the gun at the court of the house, some miles of his parents in Greenville in Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of Washington, Methel Johnson.
He left the car started on the street.
It wasn't soon why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew people who lived here.
The lamb grows in this country.
Lamb started working at a university with 3500 students in the city, reading about 12000 people in 2009, and learning the booking and hours of education.
He got a doctor in education at the yard.
One of the years old friends of Lamba described him as a smart, charismatic, and funny man.
Carla Hairston noted that it was 15 and Lambovi 20 when they met along with common friends.
She was with her friends at the high school, and he was the great older boy who taught her to play a kitary for a few years.
It was a pretty lowly heart at that time.
The hearts of all girls have come as soon as it appears," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson.
Lamb and Printiss were fully walking together.
During the nervous phone Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a cihl house that neighbors with the arm of the G.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Printiss, Shawn O ́Steen, said they've gone 15 years ago, but they've stayed friends and had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"He was completely disappointed," said O'Steen about her daughter.
She was the best friend with her mother.
O ́Steen said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he thought Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met the Printiss when they and Abigail went out on the annual festival three years ago.
They played random gigis together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sangs his own music.
Printiss was a health sister who worked for different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, barman and an opportune entertainment coordinator in The Julep Room, covering the light bar near Gıer, said that afterwards he saw Lamba and Prentiss on September 5th, the path that Lamb gained on cytarr and harmonic for an unexpected dav.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," said he.
We loved and played one another for fun.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a seminar in the first year-old and specialised to the American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, English Professor at school.
He was married and had three little kids.
He studied at Emporia State in Kansas and was the president of the boy student club and the Government of students.
At Delta State campus in Cleveland on Wednesday night, about 900 people participated in the workshops, staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and Jeff Schnidt also participated in vigilia during which the university congregation sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
In the middle, the school started again.
"We're trying to return our students," LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Written writers for Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was edited so that he reflected the fact that the police now claims that Lamb made a call after killing Schmidt, and that even though Lamb called Printiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were deceived.
Toys R Us plans to have less seasonal work
Toys R Us states that they will not take so many season works as last year, but the producers of children's games and products claims that they will give the current employees and season workers chance to work for more hours.
The company also stated that it planned to have approximately 40,000 employees on business and distribution centres throughout the country, which reduced 45,000 people from the past.
The majority of the workshops will have a shared work account.
The company declares that it will begin with the setting of meetings this month, and the employees will be gathered in October to the staff.

Michael J. Fox's talking about his "rande" with Princess Diana
The Prime Minister "Return to the Future" was a great professional moment for Michael J. Foxe.
She was careful even from the personal duties.
"We were sitting in the distraction and waiting for the arrival of the king's family when I realized that the seat near me was empty and I found that Princess Diana would sit there," he said in the trailer for the surrounding document, "Return in time."
The movie starts and I'm going to find that I'm on something that could be called false meeting with Princess of Wales.
"Return in time," is the document on "Return to the future", which states talks with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the Registry Robert Zemeckis and the executive producer Steven Playberg.
The Prime Minister "Return for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Playberg said, "It's the best way for me that has ever been filmed."
"Return in time" will get to VOD, DVDs and the selected films in October.
Boss of the United Nations says there is no military solution in Syria
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russian military support for Syria is that "no military solution" is a conflict of five-year conflict and more weapons are only worse by the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN Boss repeatedly invited all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join and support the inclusive negotiation on the finding of a political solution.
Ban said at the Mediterranean Printer that he was planning to meet the Ministry of Five Constant Countries - USA, Russia, China, British and France - at the border of the Ministerial Meeting of the Value Meeting at the end of this month for negotiations in Syria.
He expressed a policy on the fact that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers " did this unresoluble".
Ban invited five permanent members to demonstrate solidarity and units shown in the reach of the Iranian nuclear agreement in the solution to the crisis in Syria.
8 optional numbers showing that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to mark him as a person who often changes views.
Others on the hands like on the unexpected shit.
And some are prepared for implosion.
But if some of the Republicans are trying to download Donald Trump from the top of the elections, it will not happen to them (a.k.a.).
10 of the last 11 national investigations show that Donald Trump is in the lead of a double number, and some people begin seriously to ask what this means for the nomination of this magnate from the inability.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the election cycle.
Nothing of this says Trump probably wins the Republican nomination.
Experts indicate that Rick Perry's road to Herman Cain in 2011 did not finally win the only position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why it could be taken into general choices.
But external groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bushe and economic conservation group Club for Growth knows the Trump for maintaining and starting to put their dollars on the table with the goal to stop it.
Here are some recent voting numbers that indicate that real magnate is not only a mixing phase:
Trump's positive assessment turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidature in the middle of June, Monmouth's vote showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a view of this real magnate.
In the middle of July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now he has six of the 10 Republicans a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Approximately three of the 10 say that they have a negative view.
And this number is holding at the beginning stages.
After the vote of the University of Quinnipiac, which was last week, it was found that 60 per cent of the republicans had to position on the Trump.
Two thirds of GOP electors would be pleased with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of the republicans indicated that they would be "overcome" or "satisfaction" with Trump as candidate.
Only two of the 10 mentioned that they would be "inflammated" from his candidature.
Only Ben Carson creates almost the same level of supervision as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "smitted" against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next nearest level of survival?
Mark Rubio was only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republican electors claim that they would be "insatisfied" or "repulsed" if Jeb Bush was a candidate.
Most of the Republicans don't see Trump's temperature as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his injury and wounds, 52 per cent of the Republican electors were all-inclined to think that the reality has a right temperament for the president's post, according to the Monday vote ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held in the Iowa State Senator Club, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of the republicans believe that he has the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac from the last week.
However, 44 percent believes that it does not have a personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 of 10 independents say that his temperature does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
The Republican electors are advancing to this idea.
When he sets his students' cups, the Republican electors think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question who wins the GOP nomination with the greatest probability, four of the 10 said that Trump would be the best option, according to the CNN/ORC investigation of the last week.
It's a change from the late July when four of the 10 got their money on Jeb Bushe.
Complete publication: The GOP electors haven't had in the past the most clear Christian kitchen.
This time in the past cycle, 4 of the 10 publishers chose Rick Perry as candidate officer against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitta Romney.
However, a certain number of GOP electors seems that Trumpa campaign is an advantage.
Although the Republicans have been saved around the other candidate, Trump is even harmful to everyone.
Some students highlight that the divided field probably contributes to Trump is leading, while anti-Trumpov support is differently spread between more than twelve other candidates.
However, the Monmouth research at the beginning of September shows that in the hypothetic direct conflict between Trump and the rest of the Republican candidates, Trump will receive support in the meantime.
It is over Carly Fiorina at 13 points, March Ruby 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasiche, Chris Christ 33 points at everyone.
He's in the dead bathroom with Ted.
The only candidate to hurt him?
Ben Carson would lead over the businessman with 19 broad points in the hypothetic bag of one against one.
A lot of Donald Trump's staff claims that they've already made their opinion.
The new Tuesday review of CBS/NYT shows that only half of the electors supporting Trumpa claims that their opinion will not change anymore.
It is obvious that it can change things, and no one can really say that he would never change his view.
46 percent indicates that it leaves an open backward for change between candidates.
However, Trump's currently strongest contrast against his outside colleague neurochirurg Ben Carson, but the electors who consider their opinion final would go two times more likely to choose for Trump.
6 of the 10 republy agree with the Trump on immigration issues.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico in the announcement of his campaign, the immigration continues to be the main and central theme of the conversion for 2016.
Some are afraid that Trump's nabubridge distracts the keys of the Spanish electors from the Republican side and the damage of rebranding.
But according to the new Monday review of the public opinion ABC/Post, six of the 10 Republicans claims that they agree with the Trump in the issues of advocacy.
It seems that until the immigration theme remains in the sect of reflectors, Donald Trump will also remain.
The government's frustration reaches new maximums.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today have a half of the support from the Republican electors, especially because of their state of outsides.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new Monday vote ABC/Post state that they want a political outsider than someone with government experiences.
And they're also very disappointed in Washington.
The vote of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa showed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated in the Congress, 54 per cent are "insatisfied" and 21 per cent "injured".
The Summit supported the largest share of the state of carbon taxes.
Czechland gets more than 400 million.
In the first reading, the missionary record supported the Government's new top law, which adapts the amount of taxes from the surface of the coal weight of the weight of the weighing companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (CSSD) has promised the proposals that the money will also be obtained by the State and the communal budgets.
The rapporteur of oppositions, who were concerned that heavy companies would already want to sponsor the foreign as yet, because they would pay higher taxes directly to the State budget.The first read supported the government's new top law, which otherwise means that the State should achieve the largest part of the cost of taxes from the overall weight of coal from the weight of the weight of the weighting company.
The share of the State increases to 67 per cent while the share is decreased from 75 per cent to 33 per cent.
The preliminary changes also the way to calculate the refund for the increasing undertakings.
Changes in the payment for the burden of nerves shall lead to the State stock of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
The overall budget income must have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the payment must be higher.
In the preliminary year, there were approximately 450 million crowns and 150 million crown budgets.
Of the weight of cold, about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns were common.
Novela also calculates the increase in the replacement of the residual space with a allowed weight of 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
The receipt of these gardens continues to belong to the community in full range.
The Minister for Industrie Jan Mládek (CSSD) said to the sentences that the foreigners gained a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
Increasing burden payments, the law is already laid down, but the Government is laid down by its regulation.
The replacement shall be calculated again as a component of the quantity of the injury and rates for individual types of nerves.
According to the Government, the amendment is, otherwise, a positive reaction to the current economic development.
However, the ODS sentence of Marek Benda warned that the establishment of the payment by the Government Regulation should not be in accordance with the statute.
However, according to the Minister for Youth, there is no tax in this case, because the state is deemed to be a national property.
Payments are available only foreigners whose territory is difficult.
In the case of deep carbon weights, three quarters of the foreign and a quarter of the state will be obtained.
The same proportion will be in the case of radioactive hornins.
The part of the money that is on charges will be binding.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to the correction of damage after weight or in order to ensure a bathroom salvation service.
In the past, opposition lawyers who claimed, in particular, that they would damage the foreignly affected burden and country.
For example, Michal Kuchera (TOP 09 and Starosts) warned that heavy companies already want to sponsor foreigners as so far as they will pay higher taxes directly to the State budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the worst regions only so that the Minister for Finance improves the budget," said David Kádner (Osvit) selected in the Osteck country.
Before the growth of unemployment at Mosteck, the lawyer KSČM Han Aulicka warned.
Cadner and Aulicca failed to refuse the new one to refuse, the House wanted to return the law to the government to work.
The report states that, according to the weighty fires, the increase in charges will not be reduced to carbon prices because the prices are over 90 per cent of the period.
Hlouds like electrical or heatings should therefore not feel the increase of prices.
"Now, on the other hand, this fact increases the risk that heavy organizations will increase the compensation of their efforts to reduce their operational expenditure, which would, in particular, mean reduction in the number of employees," admits the Government.
However, it states that the increase in employment taxes are eligible.
According to the report to the new Milan Urban (CSSD), it is essential that the Members know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and mainly the decision of the Government on the limits of carbon weight.
If the carbon is weakening even beyond the limits, it will have effect on the income for the state and foreign, he has highlighted.
The Urban does not agree with the Youth that the decision on the cross-border limit to the Czech Army should be fallen until 2020.
The limits to the CSA below should, accordingly, be extended from social, national and foreign energy stability.
The happy will lead Czech as a single, or weather setting.
All four Czech tenists will appear in the square division of Davis' bargage in India on the table and this time each of them will soon enter into the game.
Captain Jaroslav Return plans that, due to difficult arguments, the burden of the whole quarteto will be laid down.
In Dilli, it is heavy and highlighted air wave, therefore it is expected to extend to five centuries.
We've got to take it into the bathroom.
I'd like to expand it according to the weather.
And according to the way it will look, he said back at the today's train of the Czech election in the centre of Raja Kumara Khanny.
With the one team and the forty-fourth of the world, Jirjam Fellow counts for Friday and Sunday two games.
At the position of the two probably run Luke Rosol and Radek Stepánek.
I'd like to be involved by almost everyone.
I've got it slow in my head, but I don't know yet, he said.
Another security in the Czech construction should be the Saturday Fourth.
It's just the question who's going to stand next to the experienced debris, who has in Davis' holiday at fourth budget 18:4.
Well, it's pretty funny.
It remains with Rosol, or Adam Paul.
"I really don't know with who and how it will look," he returned.
It will be decided according to two developments.
It may be a variety of Pallasek, with the Great surprised in the 1st round in the debel over Australia.
"He's in the deep," he said back.
In contrast with Australia, I'd never have the same effect that I had shown in the second century.
"I'm for these experiences and I'd bring a point," said Pallasek.
Home in the Yuki Bhambri's two, (125, in the ATP Chamber), who won last week a challenger in Shanghai, where he hit the third and four hundreds of tissue players.
Double will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
Both are players of challenges and our own experience from ATP Tour, but we have many times persuaded that the tickets in Davis' holiday are not decided.
"He decides the current form, weather," said he returned.
Wednesday introduction two games start at 6:30 SELCH and can be trapped for weather.
According to the statement, he's got a cup, and the cup's not under the box.
However, it can be played for an artificial light.
They've already burned it, and it's got two thousand luxes, which is enough.
"It should be given to play under the light," said he returned.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut on Prime Ministers
From your choice, Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ is very surprised
The new job - Chef Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut at Prime Minister's ́ons posti, and he will first have to cooperate with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will put the first of its six issues shortly after midnight, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and the lawyers.
In the weekly expression, he asked "mince divorce and more facts."
He also pointed out that he could go through a few sessions that he would leave his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby's leadership, which comes after his nomination to the Skin Cabinet and his Friday word to the TUC annual conference.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the State State in silence during the singing of the national hymnes in the service on Tuesday to the 75th annual battle in Britain was a criticism in order to preserve the work and is the centre of the attention of several stories on the title pages of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision to not sing a national himna has taken attention
Mr. Corbyn's speaker said that he would be "continuing in respectful silence" and recognize "the Royal Airport Garden in the Battle for British."
However, the member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen ́ith, announced BBC Two's Newsnight that the leader would recommend the national hymne to sing "without a view" to his conviction that monarchie should be canceled.
Almost twelve shining ministers refused to serve at the top of Mr. Corbyn team, cited differences in economic, defence and defence, and only six parliamentary parties supported him as leader.
The political co-responsor BBC Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "shopping" after Mr. Corbyn's name through his position in the European Union and the governmental dose limit.
Mr. Corbil pointed out on TUC that the Partial Party had proposed changed advice to eliminate the entire idea of the dose limit.
About a few hours later, Mr. Panëith, the secretary of the shadow work and income, said that the party "very" was opposed to the government plans for decreasing the limit of £26,000 per £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Partial Party, to whom David Cameron has chosen for the last decades since his election as the leader of the conservators.
The leader of the business party, who has promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has the ideas of "z dava" on questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30 000 people.
The MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too conflicting and that they will be held as "prepared answers", so lost trade, and instead it promises that they are faced with important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges that young people face.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow trade secret, will represent him to the PMQ when he is unemployed — for example, when Mr Cameron is traveling to the department.
He also left the idea that he would leave the final colleagues to come out for a while, because he was allowed to hear that the whole matter was still discussed with John Berco's speaker.
When Mr. Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to decline from the "Punch and Judy" policy, which was often connected to PMQ, but admitted that he failed for a few years later.
Since their first sentence in 1990, PMQ was seen as a key barometer of the leaders' judgment, their leadership and their position between the final MPs, although critics argued that they became a carrier and needed a remote reform.
"Photography in Joburg": Young homeless students learned as photographs

But a group of former children of the street found a way to learn something and share in life.
"I was focused in Joburg" is an unrequest study that teaches young freedoms how to make photographs of their neighborhood and make such money.

Among May and June, the profit of GB, most of bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the best since 2009, and it seemed that the estimates were approached when the rates were raised.
Sterling stood over 1% over $5505 and was 0.84% up to euro for €3730.
FTSE 100 index closed 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional market action and shot 20% after he got an increased offer from his rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine two largest birds in the world, and enhance the marks such as Budweier, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry action was 0.9% above after encouraged reports from the Rival Group of Richemont.
The final sales results of Richemont are above all expectations and show that the sale in China, the key market for Burberry, began to be recommended.

JD Sports was 3.1% after sports reported 83% shock in half a year in profits before delivery £46.6m
Boss JD Sports says the higher sales could hurt expansion
Executive President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that the highest minimum payment for work in the United Kingdom could mean "increasing purchasing power in potential consumers' caps."

The costs could include the JD Sports extension plans, added, which could mean less new jobs.
The opposers of the Prague apartment marshmeloun are clear.
Controversial building got a feet.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the cancellation of the decision as an anti-legal and will be revoked against it.
In contrast with the building that is to appear in the closest nearby of the Angle Classer in the center of Prague, they protested before the Office of Prague 1 hundred people, also appeared five.
The Magistrat in the decision concluded that the construction law had been violated because it had not been complied with all aspects of the territory decision.
"The subsequent territory decision does not include some aspects, such as the species of lands, distance from neighbouring buildings, sufficiently and comprehensively described the building facility, the limitation of the territory concerned by the impact of the building," it is written in its decision.
The Court also considers that some reasons for decisions have been issued to the processed documentation that has yet changed.
It is, for example, the definition of life-agencies.
Part of buildings must appear on earth National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid approval.
The written material shows that, however, the owner of the lands have made an agreement with the projecting documentation for territorial management, not with the position of the building on its grounds, writes the Board of Construction.
According to Francesca Augusta Razetta from the investment company, the Board of Construction Order did not take the decision of the Supreme Authority - the Ministry of Local Development for which the period for the start of the review has already expired.
Everyone is a scandal procedure.
"We have prepared this project for seventeen years, we have kept all the laws of the Czech Republic and respect all relevant authorities and institutions," Revetto said in the print report.
The project for which people are able to survive the colors of fasads in particular to marshmeloun, calls for strong emotions in Prague.
In the center of the city, hundreds of people were gathered to protest against building in the past.
Association and nearby homes indicate that some authorisation was issued for a house that would look different for many years ago.
They also criticize the inadequateness of the building for the historical centre of Prague and without the neighborhood of the Angle Classer.
The house proposed Zdenek Frank, the project changed several times.
The PP image of the 2008 project, which was calculated with a clear fasad, refused on the basis of the opinion of the National Memorial Foundation (NPU) of the Ministry of Culture and rejected the authorisation of Prague Memorial in 2010.
The new project of Praga Progetti e Investimenti with windows to faces, but the NPU and the directors authorised the construction authorisation on this basis.
The author rejects the results of opponents, seemingly never counted with a fasade in a red color that gave a project of survival after a white sugar.
The Czech Policy has knipped.
The magicians also brought him to the base with them.
Berg returned to Hungary with the aim of bringing humanitarian assistance to the volvings.
On the road, he took three Syrian flights, which, as a result, wanted a half miles.
At that time, according to Hungary, it was not penalty yet, he claimed to people's newspapers.
We knew that law guards did not follow such action.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, we were arrested and transferred to the investigation band in Szeged, he described a letter.
He finally spent nine hours.
The politicians thought they had the right way, but the communication, because they didn't have too good English.
However, the prison according to it was sad.

Metcash starts an outside campaign to fight with Aldi's invasion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA trades from Aldi's oppression in South and West Australia.
Metcash starts an outside campaign to fight with Aldi's invasion
While Aldi is prepared to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 trades in southern and west Australia at the beginning of the next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build an IGA mark using marketing in mainstream and social media and the adventure such as Adelaide show.
IGA trademakers and suppliers are added with labels such as Dunsborough, the freezer Simmo's offering volunteers in the IGA trades and trade holders sell detailed letters to the Australien ligue to local customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the sale of food, alcohol and hardware will celebrate its annual investor strategy day.
It's a lot of because South and Western Australia represents at least 30 percent of Metcash IGA trading steps and generates higher routes than the Metcash IGA network in Eastern States.
Customers in South and Western Australia are nottoric provinces and IGA trades use a much stronger market share than in NSW, Viktoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 per cent in Eastern States.
Each analytic such as Morgan Stanley believes that Aldi will calculate 5 percent of the food market in these two states during 12th months since the opening of the first trades that have taken the markets from all existing players, but mainly independent minors.
This week in its report analytic Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, considered that the small business IGA could lose 360 million USD on annual sale and Metcash 250 million USD at the end of 2016.
This provision is based on the fact that Aldi will open 25 trades in southern Australia and 30 in the west during the next year and will generate 500 and 600 million USD sales on individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in a strong price basis of Metcash could have approximately 13 million USD on the expenditure before the opinion, confirmed Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash lost share in markets in East States, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although the latest investigation of Roy Morgan found that IGA purchasers were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that the sales of food Metcash will be decreased by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and its market share is decreased from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent until 2020.
Last week, the Hamish Douglass Fund manager, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said that trade dinners in Melbourne could "be very probably disappeared during the decades.
Metcash refused publicly to respond to Douglas's comment.
But it is known that the member of the Metcash representation contacted Douglasse last week.
The market share of IGA decreased from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and the costs of the food market metcash added approximately 1200 IGA small trades falled by 43 per cent since 2012, which reflects the operational development of speculation changes because the sales and the costs are under pressure.
However, big trade has passed into the anti-attachment and invested more than 150 million USDs annually to equate the cross prices in Coles and Wools on hundreds of products every week and thus helps small trades in IGA to re-employ trades by adding and growing food and news from private persons.
The Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrice, claims that the programmes of price comparison and trade equipment will fall down and hope that the majority will return to the basic profit growth in 2017 first in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Steve Healym
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his behavior of glory more than critical.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became a closer lost at a recent visit around his friend Nick Kyrgios and served for his behaviour more than critical, says President Tennis, Steve Healy.
Cokkinakis, the youngest member of the talented dua often called "Special Ks", took an unwilling attention to himself thanks to the unreally known Kirgisistan and the state of Wawrink on Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a grievous ≥ ≥ ≤ ≤ 1 in Ci ́innati, they must have been Cokkinakis and his companion Ryan Harrison separated by the decisionman, Harrison said, "Wowrink had one to draw to Kirgisistan and I had to join him too."
As he was finally seen to broke the racket after the crib saw Richard Gasquet's potential exhibition to US Open, Cokkinakise was incrediblely exciting Healy.
The young man is currently located in Glasgow, where he will support Sam Groth on the location in the second two places behind Bernard Romanice in the semifinal Davis Cupu against British.
"I was very intensely thinking that Thanasi, according to my opinion, was a little locked in the whole conflict," Healy says.
He destroyed the racket when he lost the rock in the United States, but not the first player that would have chosen an expression on his racket. I know Thanasi quite well and I can say that this event is proud.
But he was very well controlled, because he was in the United States a very explosive situation for Harrison and so further, so I think he deserves great recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, and he has a great family around him, and I think he has been stuck with him sometimes.
It's a very adult 19-year-old man, works very strong, and it's a very strong team, and he's never had a problem with the final players, he's very respected, he's exercising strongly, he's in a very stable and growing young boy, and I'm soon thinking he's deserving to be judged according to his own debts.
Healy also supported the decision to review Kirgiose because of the important stock that begins on Friday, and states that "mutual decision" is a correct solution for all, but supports the parent from Canberra to return to the team as a period of stability.
"We first want our team to be completely focused on the storage and not on all this contrast that arose around [Kyrgios]," he says.
And I think Nick was very low as Federer, Murray and other people indicate, in the eyes of the public growth, he also made a few terrible errors and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we try to help him understand the results of his actions and a time outside the explanation when he will be able to think about it is, according to my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for the one.
Europe's crisis: Hungary guards the emergency, closes the border and holds
After announcement of the status of threats, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Wednesday and stopped those who tried to overcome its illegal overlap so that they stopped the migrants' attachment.
There was a chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants replaced anyone in the land and the Serbian authorities reacted rebelly.
Those who have seen a strange time in the landscapes between two states are deserving those who flee from violence in the lands of the lands of the lands are building and inhabiting themselves.
But there's a feeling of frustration.
When the helicopter flys over them, they call together "Open the border!" and continues the order unit of the Hungarian police.
Some people refuse to protest food and water.
The Serbian Ministry states that it was "inacceptable" to send the flights back from Hungary while they are still more coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbian) he wants to be part of the solution, not just indirectly.
In the next days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic states in Prague.
Inquiry at the Hungarian-Serbian border came on the day after the block of 28 States did not come with a single immigration policy at continued meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed with the share of responsibility for 40 000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and talked about the achievement of an eventual agreement next month or the end of the year, which the EU's people would adopt more than 120 000 other flights, which, in general, Hungary.
German Federal Officer Angela Merkel and Russia, on Wednesday, approved a European summit for a next week to discuss the continental breeding crisis.
However, Hungary did not turn her to Brussels or his neighbors.
The internal threat in two southern regions gave the authorities the power to resolve the crisis and allowed them to close the road and to address the cases of azyl negotiation.
Meanwhile, Hungarian minister Peter Ssiejarto said that his country also plans to build a street from the street of the frontier with Romania to stop the flights trying to travel through their country, when the stream is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that they were even on the list of those who helped to travel to the straightway between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weak and entry point to the European Union for birds, from which many have fled from the Middle East and other countries.
The President of the Government of Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them are economic persons who follow better life and not war-flying, seeking protection, which is a view that is far different from the rest of the EU countries in Germany.
The new laws that have entered into force in Northern Hungary now criminalize the violation of 4 meters of the border that the Government had allowed to set on the southern border with Serbia, and also set a longer terms in the period of transition for those who have illegally transferred the flights.
"By the caused by mass, the Hungarian government announces the status of threats," Zoltan Kovacs reporter said to the speaker of Zoltan Kovacs in the southern town of Szeged.
In this we have completely: illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technology must still approve the setting of the army expected for the next week, but reporters have observed a hardly armed army with vehicles and dogs for a few days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's adviser for domestic defence, said that the authorities captured 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 prisoners already in the country.
They have occurred through the damage of the area, and they are now charged by the police commitment for the deterioration of crimes in accordance with new laws.
The offices have let the area go.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven transitions with Serbia on Wednesday after the use of a car covered by a covered road.
On the main employment transition in Roszke, a chaos occurred because the Hungarians opened a small office in the metal container for processing, and there was pressure for people.
About 20 came in, but thousands left out.
Another group of birds blocked the main districts associating Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Options 2016: Hillary Clinton's shock before Bernie Sanders decreased about half in national vote
The former ministerial office of Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digital shot in the Democratic District on nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders will get her shot.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of democratic primary electors (a decrease of 58 per cent), while Sanders is on the other hand with 27 per cent (17 per cent growth).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has to inform whether he wants to be the president, receives support from 15 per cent of democratic primary electors.
More than five months before the beginning of the main competition, the most democratic electors claim that it is too soon to say that they are the decisions that the candidate will support.
But Clinton sponsors are more sure about their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey from the past month, Clinton's ground was lost under the feet of some demographic groups, while Sanders got sometimes.
Clinton's keeping a big spot between women and relaxing, but her leader's demanding.
Her support between men was extremely decreased and Sanders lost only five points on her.
Clinton's outcome with democracy electors under 50 years has expired, and now they're with Sanders ro.
Clinton still has a big leader thanks to older electors.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digital shot before Sanders between the liberals, but now Sanders lost it in this group only five points.
Approximately half of the democracy primary electors in all countries say that it would be very supported by Clinton if it became a candidate to the party.
The fourth would support it with certain expenditures and the other 15 per cent would only support it to be candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It's probably not surprising that Clinton's current attractions are particularly destructive.
The views are mixed among those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only a quarter would support it very well.
While 48 per cent of the democratic primary electors say that it would support Clinton, less Republican electors say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's beneficiaries are questioned in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most often answers are that he has the right experience (16 per cent), it follows that the time has come to be the President of the woman (13 per cent) and that he is the best candidate for this work (10 per cent).
Clintons also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
The following is quoted a great choice and match of problems.
While the Vice-President considers the potential candidate to the president, 57 per cent of the democratic primary electors would wish that the third person think that he should not be candidate again.
When the primary democratic electors were asked to choose as a second option for the nomination of the party, the most common option is Biden.
among Clinton's hosts, she introduced more than half Biden as their second choice, far away from Sanders.
Biden will decide to disadvantage the nomination of Democracy, Hillary Clinton's leader will spread from 20 points when Biden will candidate, 30 points without his candidature.
Fifty-five percent of democratic electors seem Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to gain in general elections, but this number fell from 78 per cent of the past month.
The poor is far away in this measure, but the percentage of people who see him as the most probably chosen is increased.
However, when the candidate's importance was more important, the democratic elector offers the priority to solve problems before the election chance.
Like the past month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate appears as an inacceptable candidate for these primary electors.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics between primary electors of their side.
Most of them see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and reliable and think they have strong leader quality.
The poor of all three leads sincerely, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of democracy primary electors don't think Clinton's honest and reliable, so two times more than those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent does not have this opinion.
Primary democratic electors also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in accordance with their ideological view.
With regard to all these measurements, the quarter of the Democratic electors has no opinion on Sanders.
As the issues regarding Hillary Clinton's decision on the use of her personal email and server as state secrets continue, the majority of primary democratic electors are satisfied with its interpretation of this matter and say that their overall view on it has not affected it.
But among the American public, it's a totally different story.
The half of the Americans is now uncomfortable with her explaining, while only about one third is satisfied.
The opinions of the public on this subject were divided in March soon after the problem was discovered.
Most Americans claim that this e-mail controversy has no effect on their total view of Clinton, while 36 per cent of their opinion on Clinton was worse.
It's mainly about the Republicans where more than 6 of the 10 claims that their view of Clinton has been worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and reliable among its electors, this issue is still a problem between the registered electors totally: only 32 per cent seems it to be honest and reliable, which is reduced by eight points from the past month and 15 points from May.
Seventy-two percent of registered electors don't think they're honest and trustworthy.
Moreover, 55 percent of the electors registered throughout the country do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump have good signs for leadership.
From six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were best conducted in honestity.
Sanders see more people as honest than unrespectable, but, as in Carson, the electors did not think of them.
The dissemination of errors in the sample of 351 primary democratic electors is 6 percent points.
Ben Carson ended after Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times research
Two candidates are responsible for half the electors in the latest investigation and the finals allow support to be reduced.
The electors of a series of publicists throughout the country continue to support the Trump Drivawich, and have developed from 23% of the support in the last CBS investigation carried out before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Wednesday.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The investigation also discovered that Carson was conducting the demography groups and putting the Trup among universally trained Republican electors.
The rest of the field with the exception of Carly Fiorin and the State of Ohio John Kasiche, is at the back of Scott Walker's Wisconsinian age, totally to the 10% support, falling to the current 2%.
Earlier Florida Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together at the third place with 6%.
The dissemination of errors in sample 376 Republican electors in the latest investigation is plus minus 6% and was done in September.
The latest CNN/ORC research that was published last week showed that Carson had demanded and reached 19% of the support between the Republicans for Trump 32% with support.
The latest investigation from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump was clearly before Carson.
During Carson’s standing trend, Trump decided to shoot the neurochirurg in the service, and Carson even apologized for the votes of the Faith of Trompe.
"We need energy," Trump announced last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood were accused of the death of a student of the first year Baruch College
During two years after the student died during the conquest brochure ritual in Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, there was a charge of murder against five people.
The members of New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michaela" Denga during the beginning of the office in September 2013, and the accused took him into the hospital, which contributed to his death, told the police.
Policies indicate that he had a binding eyes, had a bathroom full of sand on a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly weakened when he tried to reach the target through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally hurt his head pain and then fell into unconsciousness.
The members of Pi Delta Psi Brothership didn't call 911 immediately after Deng was stuck, and they probably waited for a hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police insisted.
Nevertheless, they found time to overcome Dengo's clothes, to exhaust his symptoms and to contact Andy Menga, the entire country president of the brotherhood, and to ask him for advice, the police head of Chris Vagner to print.
"In this moment the members started to hide the equipment, and they actually gave the privilege of the good news of brotherhood before Michael Denga's life," said Chef Wagner.
He couldn't survive him and died on the second day.
According to the pite report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a stupid subject in the head, and stood.
"Too many families have been enjoyed in the surroundings in brotherhoods, and at least one student dies every year for the burden since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengo's family, in a statement.
Brothership and their members must be responsible, and this step is important by the authorities.
The Great Council of Monroe County recommended an accusation of murder of the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr Menga, will also be accused of appealing and criminal community.
"We want to keep not only the involved persons, but in the case there is an organization that has approved it, whether or not officially or not, we also recognize them to the responsibility," Wagner said on the Tuesday printing.
Baruch College prohibited brotherhood and the national brotherhood rejected their relationship with local sites.
This will happen when Fed increases the rates
The growth of rates will come and the market will be covered, the debt rate will be covered and the economy will fall into the recess.
That's all we know.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it's gonna take.
For the economy, it offers specifically the story of a small bill of time.
Reces arrived after 11 months after the first increase of the rates and was 86 months.
The agressiveness of the Federal Reserve System in increased rates is often, even though not, which defines how economic and financial assets will respond.
This is why the American Central Bank officials highlighted so strongly that investors should not be focused on the increase of rates, but more than the trajectory of normalization.
There are more variables in the game.
However, the members of the market may finally ensure that all references to increased employment can be overcome.
"After the increase of the Fedu since the world financial crisis will be inevitably interpreted to some as the end of the era of 'valuable money'," said Julian Jessop, leader of the global economy of Capital Economics, in a note for the clients of Julian Jessop.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of American rates to the running, but still low, to create a seismic shock that many might be afraid.
That means that it's going to come to an unprecedented.
Here is a view of how some economics will respond on the basis of historical trends:
In view of what the market mentioned in the last month, the expected increase in the rate of air may be a little constant.
But as soon as the growth occurs, it's so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a trend for re-interrupting action after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect prolongation in monetary policies," the Deutsche Bank analysis stated in a recent study of what happens after the increase of the Fed.
Exactly said, the market in the last 35 years often - about 14 per cent - aims to increase the rates in relatively areas in 250 days (a average increase of 2.6 per cent), and then returns to the normal state after 500 days, with a meaning of the last six cycles 14.4 per cent, according to the recent analysis of Bob Doll, the main action strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, published to Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the action trends to be a higher position in the rate increase cycle and the return begins to be decreased.
Reces is a fact of economic life, but increase in taxes are often helping.
At present, the Fed addresses some signs that have not yet existed and which may make the recess successful.
The most important is that the gross domestic product near his lowest point in history by increased fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the period of 118 increased rate from 1950 only twice the nominal interannual growth of HDP was under 4.5 per cent.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 per cent, it was little to expect its destruction when it was only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, Atlanta Fed states.
Increasing rates in this complex economic background could be riskant and might be a question of whether this time is different, said Deutsche.
The market participants were prepared for the growth of Fedu all the year, and all eyes returned to the meeting of the Federal Committee for the Free Market, which was held this week and ended on Thursday.
While many strategies and economys are expected that FOMC could approve growth at this meeting, the future trade only indicates the probability of 25%.
"In our study since 1950, all increased cycles afterwards were in the super cycle of increased pack effect with HDP covering the top of the beginning of the recess after starting discontinuation," says the report.
Instead, this was significantly slow from the worst recess during the sample collection period.
The current cycle is far from the longest of those when the Fed waited from the end of the last recess; the record was 35 months, now we are 74 months and we continue.
The strong cost was also voluntary because the market expects an increase in rates and a pattern is sometimes similar to what does the action.
The difference is that the impact is more evident in debt than in action when Fed changes the policy direction.
In debt, the expenditures appear to change the direction immediately after the first income of the cycle of increase/decrease.
At the end of the cycle of increased debt rate falls immediately," Deutsche said.
The strategy of Charles Swaba believes that increase in the rate causes an increase in the rate between- and short-dated debts, which equivalents the currency.
Debts with high cost often work better in this climate, although "we're still careful about the exchange of revenue," she said in her analysis of Kathy Jones, a strong analysis of the fixed revenue in the Swab company.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the expectation of the Fed policy.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the decrease of inflation expectations, there are a few signs that the market has been adapted to the views of a harder monetary policy," she wrote.
Shortly rate rates are upwards, the cost currency is more flexible, the credit breakdown has increased and the calling has increased - all the market characteristics when Fed is dealing with the policy.
Generally, companies who operate their business in the United States win after the growth of rate rates and local products become more attractive.
The international company with many debts will be worse because the growing dollar will make their products more precious in the world market area and their debt will also be more.
"History shows that the "quality" of action has the trend to overcome within three months after the initial increase of rates," said the Goldman Sachsve analysers in the client report.
The firms with strong balances have decreased the weak developing company in each increase in the rate rates in 1994, 1999, 2004, in average of 5 percent points.
Communications with high amounts, as with low callatilite resources, also overcome their counterparts by 4 (percent points), respectively 3 (percent points).
The debt becomes a big problem.
A community with a high percentage of the moveable rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Notwithstanding the pure action games, the needs also bear the burden of the growing dollar.
Contributors can also see their profits through higher costs, but experts have different views of how it will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, the strong deputy Andrew Bingham
Conservate Mr. Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "deepness"
He's thinking that it's more unrecognible than his business concurrence
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and said he just fooled British.
The missionary colleague Damien Collins attacked the voice and even said he's not the original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "changed" to Classic FM, confirms the leader and thrombs a fresh pressure for sending to prove that they do something they do not make.
Conservation of Mr Andrew Bingham also told BBC boss that the audience station of public service seems to be "deep" and is more unrecognable than his business support.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "deeply" - but it seems to change to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, started in the end of the year.
BBC Music Awards, which began in the remote year, seems to be British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are two examples that attack me when you actually just imitate what we already have on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The Director-General BBC's accusation refused to refuse that BBC Radio 3 is far from his business support in relation to living music and public education.
What I learned about classical music at the Council 3 I wouldn't learn any other way.
And their obligation to live with music and music creation is in a spiral level.
"I also think that the obligation of Radio 3 to find a new music and introduction into new works in the operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, regulator BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work a firm to join the public than before, because the British are less educational about classical music.
Nevertheless, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that was obtained under fuel because of shopping to trade competitors during the sending of Culture, Media and Sport and heard the Commission.
Conservates the lawyer Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show that BBC bought from the Netherlands Talpa Media producer for a estimated price of £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is discussed as unoriginal and especially different?
Lord Hall held that the BBC1 show - in which the stars of Paloma Faith andBoy George as judges - were made "typely for BBC".
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "found hit from his own stage" when he'd start a fun series.
However, he refused to deal with more future series of the The Voice series or to lose the money of license payers for other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales grow at the latest time since August and on wine can be Black Thursday
Three months 2015's 7% growth online sales
The last month has been mentioned the lowest growth since the 2000 records were started alone
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago through mobile purchase
Experts that November Wednesday the Black Wednesday could be a deterioration of loss
More than the decades, it was an invasion acquisition, and it has become a city of spirits from many British main streets.
However, experts claim that the signs of online sales deterioration are presented, and the new data indicate seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenses for aeroplane represented the lowest growth from the beginning of 2000, with only 5 per cent growth compared to the past year.
Professors claim that signs of online sales deterioration are made, and new data indicate seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the growth level in the past years and go back to 2000, this status has been rationalised," says Guardian Andy Mulcahy, the IMRG market index editor.
It explains that Internet sales were uploaded three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to carry out purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and were able to carry out purchases in different contexts, for example on a chat.
But now (creasing) sometimes, and that is why it seems to be distracted.
The phenomenon of the Black Friday, which was taken from America, is quoted as one of the decreases of sales.
Experts shall ensure that customers may keep purchases before this event last Friday in November.
In the past year, five times more than the average of the purchasers returned to their computers to arrange purchases and match several seller pages.
Professors recognize that Black Friday, which the purchasers rebuild, can keep customers from other purchases
The link published by British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was lost online.
For some products such as televisions and shops, more than a third of the sales are carried out through the web trades.
In addition, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and bottles online, instead of buying in stone modal sales.
The Muslims buried the victims of Jericho in Mecca, and the Bin Ladina family was sanctified
The body of 29 dead was transferred by the streets of Muslims at the execution of the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is partly charged with the wine for the collapsing magnate of Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health has stated that 394 people were also hurt after the Jericho has risen.
Hundreds of Muslims were gathered to be buried by 29 victims of the jewelry fall in Grand Mosque in Mecce. The body of victims was wearing on the street.
They were dressed in a certain degree in white, the truckers chose their way and gave up a victim when the first of the fallers arrived on his last journey on the bursts in Al-Moaissem.
The silent message passed around the sanctuary place, where only a few days ago, the building inhabitants broke the mixture and switched up.
The body was released to the funeral, and the Saudi king sanctified the building group of the Bin Ladina family over the disaster, which also left 394 vulnerable.
The body of 29 dead after the jewelry's fall in Grand Central Mosque in Mekca was born by streets
Among the dead was the father of four Qasim Akram children from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first road when Jericho rose up.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the year's beach.
The Saudi officials have already promised that the midst to Mecca would be done, and thousands of people continue to join the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group shouldn't leave the jewelry's arm up when he was not in the operation.
The Arabic version of the statement, which has been carried out by the Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of the fall.
This detail has not been reported by the disc service of the Agency, but it has noted that the company's heads were prohibited to travel to the rental.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to discover what caused the fall of Jericho to the Grand Mixture, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims covered before Hadge’s road in this month.
Binladin Group had no declarations on the collapses of jail and were not given to his representatives for comments.
The Royal declarations also charged the group for no use of the latest security measures, and the lack of coordination with the orological officers.
Decades of Jericho surround Grand Mosque in Mecce, which is part of the massive building effort in front of Binladin Group.
Binladin's family was near Saudi-Arabian government family for decades and operated large building projects.
The latest leader of Al-Kaidy Usama bin Ladin was the son of the relief, whose family was deceived in the ninety-years.
Havary has become in the powerful tree and rain only a few days before the delivery of millions of people in the Kingdom on a road, which at least once in life has to determine every powerful muslim.
Officials say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The officers determined that one million rials (£ 174.000) would be denied by the family killed and the same amount for permanent hurt.

The result is that Kingfisher plans to open 200 other Screwfix trades related to businesses, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury claims that he wants to work more women in the B&Q trades because eight of the ten purchase decisions in the trade make better half.
Currently, the work of men is a man's sex.
She said that there is a need to celebrate growing demographic trends that show more women's households that make more home adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laury says, "We're still working with a man in business.
We need to draw close to the balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women who make 80% decision on the purchases of goods.
Women play a great role in the decision process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of the only five women in the feeding fire, according to the British FTSE100 Index, also restructured her speech team to reflect the equality between men and women manager.
Kingfisher stands at the same time that he has a half-representation of women among employees in terms of practical and financial directors.
Mrs. Laury says, "This was a home decision - Divergence is a important subject here.
So it wasn't difficult to find a good woman that took to us.
Kingfisher announced the fall in the mid-year winning and then selling the group took the costs of closing trades.
The outcome of the Kingfisher trend, owned by Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new businesses

Set the Sezam'ai in the juice diet, the canopy helps strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the abundance of well-satured unsatured fat acids from these fruits is the use of extra females.
All healthy substances will remain in the oil when they draw from seed for cold.
Therefore, these oils are suitable as part of health diet, such as yellows.
Some extra female oils are suitable for prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
These are the most common dead of the Czech dead, according to the Constitution of Health Information and the CR for several years.
Yellow baths are primarily suffering from women, helping the Sezam Island.
You belong to the lovers of the Asian kitchen, you must not lack the sezam'i, which is part of the original recepture for exotic foods.
For the extent of the remaining areas, it can also be used for the heat adjustment of food and has a number of beneficial health agents.
It is often used in the juice diet.
Essential massive acids containing are a good prevention of the appearance of yellow stones.
They are from 90% of the cause of juice and women suffer three times more often than men.
In general, the problems with the juice are mainly related to people with overweight that are not transporting and consuming a lot of animal tubes.
Sezam ́ai is successfully used even in the liver diet that is very similar to the yellow.
People want to use all health benefits that bring the consumption of this oil should take care of goods from the exotic food trade.
Asian farmers often use a broadcast seed that has a greater pleasure.
Oil so, but it will come about all the substances, described Ladislav Hachecky, the Executive Director of the Czech company Bohemia Olei from Kraslic to Sokolovsk, which produces bio female oil listed for cold.
The company also produces the sezam eye and uses exclusively unleavened seed of white sesame.
In a hour, our lis will be able to pull 8 kg of sezam.
The mechanical dilution of sulphure is maximally 40 degrees, and the product therefore meets the criteria for extra female labelling.
At higher temperatures, the loss of survivals would occur.
The sun’s songs in heart - and - fever diseases.
The Czech favorite between oil is solar.
From the research of Jarmily Hamerska, leading to the University of Masaric, it showed that it prefers 43% of respondents in the warm kitchen.
However, it is not suitable for smiling, it begins to burn at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, for salates, and it is especially in the diet that helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It also contains a high portion of the limit of 6 unsatured fat acids, which most of all fat acids decreases cholesterol.
In heart problems, you need to take care of the quantity of totally accepted tube and calories.
For example, in one sunlight oil, there are 62 calories, and 99 calories in the raw oil.
As regards the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with foods are much more appropriate than those called empty calories.
These are parts of the industrially adjusted products.
That's why it's appropriate to go after extra female oil.
This sunset will keep the same as the sezam and the canopy for nine months.
Storage in January is still longer.
The older people know, in particular, according to the bitter shot.
On the contrary, it's not a bathroom at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically raffined.
Conopny geometry contains most healthy acids.
The seed of the technical canopy is consistent with such super-food food, and therefore the canopy is considered the most healthy of plants.
For this label, thanks to the maximum level of limit 3 and 6 non-satured fat acids.
These essential massive acids can't make the body himself, and a person must accept it from food.
It is particularly important to obtain 3 mass acids.
The clinical survivals published in the European magazine showed that the daily receipt of this substance is inadequate.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, but Icelandians accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Conopny ́aj is appropriate to include in the kitchen as part of the support diet for the strengthening of immunity and injury.
He has anti-inquinatives and is a part of cell membrane.
People don't need to use canop oil to be afraid, does not contain any psychoactive substance.
It confirms that the Bohemia Olye company belongs to the most sold.
It's selling 500 litres annually.
People often enjoy one liar in a nice way.
Conopny ́aj is not any pleasantly distinctive but greatly strengthening immunity, advised Daniel Vlček from the Krastic Bohemia Oly.
According to them, they're the most interesting nation of Americans.
There's 1,4 grill for one house.
Thereafter, throughout the world, the most different competition in grilling, which only confirms the success of this culinary discipline.
They're not even the Czechs.
On the basis of Czech market investigations, we find that only 4% of people in their lives haven't gone.
It's just a few times in the year.
In order to succeed, we cannot underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adapt the meat by marineing a few hours before warm adjustment.
Which is the most convenient, and the same is the health of the well-being substance when the grilling?
Generally, it applies that when the grilling process is alone, it should be watched by the tuke.
Professors agree that large part of the areas begins to lose their pleasure at high temperatures.
healthy extra female oil is also related to the body of benefiting substances, which are otherwise obtained by consumption of food fixed at lower temperatures.
But it doesn't mean that extra female oil can't find their application.
The horrible for grilling, health and beauty.
When the meat is told, the experts from the Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovska will immediately be equipped with a horrible.
It is a wonderful complement of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, it is indicated that the unique property of increasing natural feed.
It is also suitable for smiling and grilling because it has a high degree of burning up to 216 °C.
Thus, even in such a high temperature, as one of the small ones keeps the health of prosperous substances, she describes the benefits of the horrible oil Daniel Vlček from the Bohemia Oil company, which belongs to some of the Czech producers of this oil from the river.
Professors agree that the horrible is 50 times more than vitamin E and 20 times more than vitamin C.
It further contains high quantity of liolic acid, so it is ­equilibrant in fighting cholesterol overcome.
In the horrible oil, it also accepts our body of important non-saturated fat acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the beneficial volume of these substances, it helps to reduce the high blood pressure, increase the metabolism, and has to affect the renal effect.
Consumption of horrible oil also helps to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, it is used in the treatment of ace and helps to care for the suck and flame hair.
The chief coach use of horrible oil in the kitchen praise.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold foods, such as for salads, but also for warm food adjustment.
Therefore, it should be used immediately in two ways, in marine and alone.
We'll keep their deepness by marining meat and fish.
In the preparation of marinade, three ingredients must be presented: ‘—, oxygen and root’.
We add oxygen, for example, to a jabble octame, and we target the mixture of the flesh.
The root adds the mass of silk and reserves and adds the right rice, Daniel Vlček advises.
In addition, it adds that the horrible  Ayahy is perfect for marine because, as one of the small, it is able to broke through the dark meat.
So marine meat or fish are ready to grill, how to continue?
Extra female oil is indicated by preparing food only a couple of coppers.
That's the same thing for grilling.
Some oil are for this way to prepare full tab.
It seems particularly to be a lin, conople, and copper oil that shouldn't be burned at all.
Before your alone grilling, you'll cut down the oil, you'll prevent the burning of the food.
The necessary part of grilling is also the preparation of the Annex.
The grilled meat and fish are practically worth anything - grilled greenine, coated bread, light green salat and many other.
Bohemia Olivia Bohemia's Chefs recommend a Horkee's salat for a year.
To him: • 1 box of brochure • 1 stick of hands • 1 cup of closed cup • 1 cup of salat sheets mixed • 3 clusters of horrible oil
Add to the mixture of salat sheets with a locked hand, closed sheets, and to the large cows of a locked broke.
According to the cow, you can also investigate the milk chi and the soja cotton.
Finally, get some of the horrible oil coppers.
For a exceptional pleasure, then you can spend the salat with a slightly covered mangle.
Distracted glasses: not only depends on the medicines but also on the cause of a patient.
Disrupted glaroze is complicated illness and a person with this diagnosis care of a series of experts: neurology, physiotherapeuta, ergotherapeuta, urologist, oftalmology, psychology, psychiatric and many other specialists.
However, it is not only for medical care, such as women with diluted glasses and congestion, if they are determined to have a child, to take care of these diseases as well as social law advice, recommendations for the adjustment of residence.
However, all of this is missing: the development of disease may primarily affect the patient himself.
As much more he will fight the disease actively, he can work longer, and he does not need to change its life in principle.
As physicians warn, the passive of the diseases releases a space for the disease activity.
For example, it is demonstrated that a regular movement is significantly distanced from the time when a disease of compensation help, for example a throat.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not obey different myths, for example that the disease is automatically leading to the end of the vehicle.
This is why the page has appeared to you (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by running media campaign Give you chance.
The most important person in the care of the sick with diluted glaroze is neurological.
In diluted skleroze, it is due to a double order that the disease of which the disease is inclined to treat before, the doctor may have some effect.
It's because we have medicines on discontinued glass at a disturbable stage when the neurogeneration process is not yet so strong.
As soon as we get inside, the more is on it that we are able to stop and remove the invalidization, explains MUDr. Eva Meda from Neurological Clinic The General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with diluted skleroze of rehabilitation care, which most often resolves the weakness of the lower ends or equality disorders.
It works with those who are sick in accordance with their individual needs: to decrease the concision, to improve behaviour, to strengthen the sunday, to modify the violation of polling or to improve coordination.
"It's really individual, depends on the specific efforts of the patient," says MUDr. Martin Kövari, primary Clinica of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Faculty hospital in Motole.
Although people with distressed glasses suffer the same illness, they show themselves a little differently in everyone.
Rehabilition cannot stop, but it may be quiet to her symptoms.
The movement activity, however, strengthens the immune status of the body, which is in the case of disturbed glass demanding.
Another positive of regular exercise is that sick ones are able to verify what they can, and that strengthens their self-detectation.
"When endorfines are trained, and a man feels well after it," PhDr. Kamala Rosa from the Clinics of Rehabilitation Medicinal Faculty of the Royal Vinogarda.
By affecting the physical page, we act on the limb system responsible for emotions.
That's how we include psychiatric and immune processes, and we stabilize the disease, it adds.
"Before these patients were so-called, we know today that they have a target burden," says Professor PaedDr. Paul Colar, the preferences of the Clinics Rehabilitation and physical medicine Faculty hospital in Motole.
The objective of physiotherapy is that a person can stay as long as self-subsidy, and it is, in particular, a job.
Thus, the physiotherapeutics cooperate with ergotherapeutes so that everyone gets a compensation help with his ears in peace.
Many patients care and care of psychology or psychiatric.
They're in a hard lifetime.
When a serious disease comes into your life, a lot of people will take it away.
It's a shock, panic, fear.
He needs to respond to a big burden - the loss of health.
With this painful soul, we have to follow someone, not trying to put everything into our own threats.
"I work with them so that they finally conclude that even with a handicapped can live a fully-valuable life and that disturbed glass does not mean the end of life," says Renata Malin's psychoterapeut - Schubert from Neurological Clinics The General Faculty Sickness in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere wouldn't fly airbuses.
Aeroplane production is a synonym of accuracy and progressive.
New aircrafts are full of titan or light and solid composite materials that no one can soon produce and process.
Nevertheless, near supercasts, computers of driving machines, near composers' cars for composers' creation, it is added to something that is so usual as merunic pecks.
In a bubble that is on a cut on a sugar vacuum, the powder is packed in the rock of the powder parts that have just been taken out of the fresh machine.
"No one has yet come to anything better," laughs Ivan Dubski, the general director of the manufacturer of the airport door Latecoere of the Czech Republic.
In the Prague Society Area, the former Airbus A320 is the full door of the Airbus.
As the only world adds a door for Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors whose part is composed of Prague are also traveling to the first and higher class on the top borders of the world’s largest transport airbus A380.
There are also the doors full of composites for a new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
The accuracy is the main motto here.
Maybe the current keys allow the company to seize two times a year.
In the Prague tower, they should explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing who run regularly to determine whether the doors are produced in accordance with the agreed rules.
Human senses, but the progressive technology hasn't replaced completely yet.
On one door to A320 there are 1500 news.
You have to screw the nitrators manually.
They're going to take them two days.
Even according to the sound of the incoming chart, they know if the new one is already correctly depleted.
The tolerance in which they move is minimum.
The nut may ascend over the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 milimetres.
That's about a double side of the human hair's hair.
When checking, it's going to come to a series of trained hairs.
When the controller goes through a number of notes, he knows if there's someone outside the tolerants.
Then we'll take the exact corner in the hand.
Aeroplanes lived before 1989 the program for the cycle of military airport L-39.
But in 1991, no one was born anymore.
The company had to find new orders.
At that time, the European Airbus Airbus Airbus was acquired.
wins the selection procedure for the supplier of the neck doors for the A32 model
The talks with Boeing weren't so happy.
"We were a small company that had not enough money for investment and that Boeing could guarantee stability supply," says Dubski.
The doors of the American producer would remain shut up if the Airports were not attained to the Prague International Aviation Association of the French Latecoere Group in 1999.
I talked about our partnership with Airbus there.
The second day, the French negotiations were divorced, says Dubski.
In a year later, Latecoere bought a Czech company, and with a strong company there were new prohibitions.
Once in 2000, the A320 part of the door mount was spread.
Three years later, the door of the top balls for A380 arrived.
In 2006, the company set a new hall for the processing of composites for deliveries for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, they didn't get to these big offers themselves.
Perhaps they did parts or small parts.
Parents want the guarantee of delivery for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubski.
Loni Czech Latecoere has reached over 2.9 billion and profits after 147 million crowns.
Exclusion of the position between the aircraft suppliers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague since 2000 has invested 1.5 billion crowns.
The company shall have quality certificates, 170 special manufacturing processes and key employees certificates.
Without them, the business would not make any door to the airport.
Getting certificates that manufacturing processes meet customers' requests and that they are maintained in repeated checks according to the Dubical million coron.
Electrical processes change each year.
They're more precise and harder.
We need to train employees, manufacture equipment and re-certificate the whole process, adds Dubski.
Now the company ends the preparation of the process of powder with zink and nick, which replaces the advantage of human health damageous cadmium.
They have received the task from the manufacturer, but then they have to adapt to equipment or chemicals used in Prague.
People from Boeing will come and check the concepts of the whole line.
Then we'll put them in the production.
They're checking our laboratory too.
One of the samples test themselves in their laboratory and then the results are compared to ours, approaching Dub’s way of control.
The payment of the Prague firms is excluded from contracts.
There's a trailing train today, and the production of embragers is falling.
For A320, it shall produce half of the total volume of the door.
Replace the Czech Latecoere is impossible or very complicated for the Brazilian or European manufacturer.
However, it doesn't mean that he could tell him any price outside the door.
The part of the contract is a price currency.
This specifies how many doors will stand after ten, fifty, steaks made.
The price for the cut still decreases to a certain limit value.
We must enter this price sample.
If not, we'll sell, Dubski says.
The half of the hail, where electric boxes are completed for the military airbus A400 M, is still empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
There is a new semi-robotical line for the browser and mount the door for the innovated A320 Neo model.
The nutrition is exhausted and exhausted.
"This is the trend to mount in the airport," adds Dubski.
My future line is safe.
Airbus reports that aircraft companies have yet negotiated 3278 cups of the new A320 model.
Only a few meters near the line will appear for the full mount door for the upper board A380.
It's the strategic decision of our mother company.
The aim is to reduce the production time and reduce costs.
The full montage could start within two years, says Dubski.
However, before, the company has to carry out tests for the installation of certain electrical and electronic equipment to the door for the largest Airbus.
The company also makes further development of the production of composite materials.
Furthermore, Boeingu should also participate in the new Airbus A350, which will competite with the American Dreamliner.
"For the company it's a huge credit when it can be processed outside metal materials and composures," it's proud Dubski.
However, Latecoere is given to the food of production capacity in Czechland.
There's no other place in the Airport Areal where it sits.
Before the French mother's entrance, the company had 180 employees.
Now they're 800 years old and to three, they could be more than a hundred.
As Airbus and Boeing will be prejudiced, how many hundreds of new airlines are in charge every year, they must not be afraid of work.
Although he has offers for a few years ago, the mother company of the Prague Latecoere had a threat to bankroot.
The French group had not enough money for a loan payment.
Finally, Latecoere was able to talk to the main believer.
At the end of August, part of their loan changed for action.
Believes have received a increase in the company by 57.4 million euro share of 37.4 per cent.
The company's debt decreased by two thirds, so about 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial healing came on the beginning of September.
The company requested a new action between the current actors for EUR 222,9 million.
In general, the basic amount of EUR 280 million has been highlighted.
In addition, the whole group is weakening from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which share 85 per cent in the markets.
The average increase of the prohibition is expected by four percent per year until 2017.
The prohibition book has charges for 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to the four-year production.
The French media claims that Latecoere finally can be rebuild after years in the cabs.
The Czech travel in the Prague Soviets is important for groups.
16 percent contributes to the group markets.
According to the number of employees, the largest employment group is.
The members supported the largest share of the state of carbon taxation.
Changes in the payment for the burden of nerves shall lead to the State stock of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
The overall budget income must have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the payment must be higher.
In the preliminary year, there were approximately 450 million crowns and 150 million crown budgets.
Of the weight of cold, about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns were common.
Novela also calculates the increase in the replacement of residual space with a allowed weight of thousands of coroners per one hectare per year.
The receipt of these gardens continues to belong to the community in full range.
The Minister for Industrie Jan Mládek (CSSD) said to the sentences that the foreigners gained a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
Increasing burden payments, the law is already laid down, but the Government is laid down by its regulation.
The replacement shall be calculated again as a component of the quantity of the injury and rates for individual types of nerves.
According to the Government, the amendment is, otherwise, a positive reaction to the current economic development.
However, the ODS sentence of Marek Benda warned that the establishment of the payment by the Government Regulation should not be in accordance with the statute.
However, according to the Minister for Youth, there is no tax in this case, because the state is deemed to be a national property.
Payments are available only foreigners whose territory is difficult.
In the case of deep carbon weights, three quarters of the foreign and a quarter of the state will be obtained.
The same proportion will be in the case of radioactive hornins.
The part of the money that is on charges will be binding.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to the correction of damage after weight or in order to ensure a bathroom salvation service.
In the past, opposition lawyers who claimed, in particular, that they would damage the foreignly affected burden and countries.
For example, Michal Kuchera (TOP 09 and Starosts) warned that heavy companies already want to sponsor foreigners as so far as they will pay higher taxes directly to the State budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the worst regions only so that the Minister for Finance improves the budget," said David Kádner (Osvit) selected in the Osteck country.
Before the growth of unemployment at Mosteck, the lawyer KSČM Han Aulicka warned.
Cadner and Aulicca failed to refuse the new one to refuse, the House wanted to return the law to the government to work.
The report states that, according to the weighty fires, the increase in charges will not be reduced to carbon prices because the prices are over 90 per cent of the period.
Hlouds like electrical or heatings should therefore not feel the increase of prices.
"Now, on the other hand, this fact increases the risk that heavy organizations will increase the compensation of their efforts to reduce their operational expenditure, which would, in particular, mean reduction in the number of employees," admits the Government.
However, it states that the increase in employment taxes are eligible.
According to the report to the new Milan Urban (CSSD), it is essential that the Members know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and mainly the decision of the Government on the limits of carbon weight.
If the carbon is weakening even beyond the limits, it will have effect on the income for the state and foreign, he has highlighted.
The Urban does not agree with the Youth that the decision on the cross-border limit to the Czech Army should be fallen until 2020.
The limits to the CSA below should, accordingly, be extended from social, national and foreign energy stability.
Time for decisions on rates for the Federal Reserve of America
The whole world follows how the American Federal Reserve wants to meet within two days in the middle and Thursday to take the basic decision on whether to increase the tax rates first after the decades.
The investigation of 80 economys held by the Rhe’s Agency has found that more than half of those who believed that the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think that they would remain inactive for a long time and leave rates within 0-0.25 per cent.
It's a story event because it's been sitting a year since Fed's decreased the rates to zero.
First of all, we draw close to the time when the main central bank could be able to get from the zero latch and start the process of normalization of rate rates," says Angel Ubide, the leader of Peterson's International Economy Institute.
The American economy was relatively good, it has come back in the form of adding a trillion dollars to the state and the creation of only a low level of inflation.
Fed cannot, however, ignore less red global perspective.
They warned the markets to be prepared for increase, but the circumstances confirm that they also see great opportunities against this step.
The decision must be notified on Thursday 20:00 SEC.
The shooter at Delta's State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and after the same day and his colleague - wrote a message in which he claimed that he was his first murder and that he wanted to take it back, they found the Governing Body on Wednesday.
The police in Gâer in Mississippi stated that Lamb, a secretary and social teacher at Delta's State University, called to the police on Monday about ten hours
And he said he shot someone.
The lamb of the dispute asked to send the police to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also changed that there is a "small dog" in the house, which "no one will be scattered" but is disappointed.
The police requested a calling name, but Lamb didn't represent.
The lamb also didn't explain why it was shot in the house.
When the police arrived in the place of the work, Amy Printiss’s 41 - year - old body found a manually written message from Lamba: “I am so sorry, and I want to take it back.
I loved Ammy, and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaveing the message, Lamb was spent 300 miles a road to Delta University, where he killed the artists of the history of Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
The University of William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “in Mr. Lamba's head was obviously playing something”.
Despite the Monday statement that Lamb was evidently believed in the romantic relationship of Amy Prentiss with Schmidt, the Governing Body stated that the "friendly triangle" does not exist "no evidence".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married with the Printis's married over seven years, pointed out that she was “good person”.
Divorced 15 years ago, but both of them remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was “depressed”.
O'Steen said that the Printiss and her daughter were "the best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, nearby Printiss' girl, as Sun Herald said, the Printiss worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that the Printiss, who had a hunter dog named Blesk, walked with Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help the final," Knowles listened.
The police noted that Lamb talked to his family on Monday and said that it would not be done.
When the cops reached him at the distance near Greenville at the same night, Lamb stopped and fled into the forest where he was shot.
According to the magazine that he published on the school sites, Lamb received a doctorat at the Delta University on June 2015.
Stars that lost their bottle
Herec (left), on the photo with his son Redmond (right), has a few stressing years behind him.
In 2001 he struck with leukemia and in 2009 lost his annual partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer.

All these things will certainly choose their tax.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months from the game for a double break.
Luke Shaw suffered a double broken right feet during the destruction of Manchester United in Liz of Masters against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defense left this hurt in tears and arranged it out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and he thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The wound caused an invisible step of Hector Moren in 15 minutes when the twenty-year-old Shaw traveled into the PSV space.
Nine minutes were treated on the throat and was also needed a oxygen mask before it was taken into the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's suffering a double broken feet and now he's in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then operated in Manchester.
It's horrible - the guy who comes to Manchester in 18 years, it's very hard, but plays fantastics and then happens this.
When he was in the clothes, he also had a set oxygen mask.
Placal.
I'm not a doctor, but a double broken leg requires six months of treatment and is able to play in a group phase.
I believe this season's still playing.
Moreno was lucky not to get a red card and a penalty.
The Mexican Nicola Rizzoli decided not.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian decision was missing.
You can examine whether it was the penalty and the red card.
It was a very terrible step on both feet.
Tweet from Shawa says, "Thank everyone for their reports, words can't say how devastated I'm, my way to rebuild begins now and I'm going back even stronger."
Relative: Manchaster United mentioned hurt Luke Shawa against PSV
The defensor will have an additional motivation to rebuild Europe's skills in the next July in France.
Phillip Cocu, coach PSV, said, "It was a very terrible hurt."
When any player gets out of the shot with such a hurt, everyone is very comfortable.
It's never the purpose of our players to hurt the players.
Moreno suffered the breaking of his feet at the Mexico camp against Van Gaal Netherlands in the world in 2014.
"It's very hard because his intention was not to hurt the player, and when you hear about the seriousness of such a hurt, it's not good," said Cocu.
I wasn't able to watch this moment.
I just saw a bottle that looked in another direction, so it seemed to have touched him [Moreno], but I didn't see a step on Luke.
In a conversation for SBS6 Moreno said, "I know how he feels, I know how difficult this thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
PSV player AndrésGuardo was also transferred to the hospital after Chrise Smalling.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: when a child loves a book, he does not continue until he learns to remember it almost.
You don't have to be David Cameron.
At the question of the Children's schemes provider to name the favorite Children's book, he chose the president of the Government of Lorax, a battle from Dr. Seusse from 1971.
It was hard to choose, writes Cameron in a report published on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Soft, famous, creative, and strong, I have read my child, because there was a picture or message that I haven't seen before."
Well, until then, in the next paragraph, Cameron described the books according to the output from the 2012 film, which added additional letters and details to fill the structural original text.
"In the town of Thneed-Ville, the wall of the wall, where all nature has stopped existing, and even the air is commodity, the boy named Ted hopes that he will get the heart of his dreams, Audrey, fulfilling her desire to see a tree," is a structural content of the book that mentions the object of the love of the unknown Dr. Seuss, whose true name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
James was not alone, the text added to Cameron was read as a comprehensive output of the Lorax movie database film, which is located on the website of the Internet Movie, and begins the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville, the walls where all nature has stopped existing, and even the air is comod, the boy named Ted hopes that he will get the heart of your dreams, Audrey."
Because he was open to a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not meet the book where the young man named is learned that the local nature devastats the cocking trees of the industrialist Once-ler, who even through the protests of the title Loraxe, the thrown, the primary creature, which "speaks out of the trees".
With the biggest probability, so relatively small PR has received an assistant who never read Lorax child 20 times in the kids.
The speaker Downing Street noted that the text was soon coming from Cameron's staff office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was offered by Cameron's employee, but without another comment.
Adam Lyth was in a threat to the remembrance of England, but still keeps
Contribution to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after the team that England has chosen on this tour, I think it will not be too likely to repeat the 3-0 destruction that has suffered the past in the experimental series.
I wouldn't exclude the gates' gateway.
The side of Alastaira Cooka can be less experienced than this three years ago, but there is a good spin player in this packaging building and also a collective thinking is strong; they will not be brought by the kidneys from 2012, but only by the youth's positive.
With the foot is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although it is unknown at the level of the test series, represents an attacking option.
Relative: Adam Lyth fell out of England team in a series experiment and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to mention Adam Lyth is a strong test for me because his main trainer is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in appeals and simple, but the reality is that the crickets players are judged on the basis of the execution.
For example, around the name Joe Root, there were no questionnaires that led to an announcement because — and this I already said — players are their best electors.
Another half-years, and Lyth could prolong his series, but he had control over his own judgment.
Let's hope that if he gets more running for Yorkshire, another opportunity will be opened.
Glaze to the trainer of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position, even though his performance were not completely gradual, and it doesn't surprise me; it was a team player.
The question of how many temptation time a bullet gets to show it is a strong orchard.
Lith got seven shoes — like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance home and outside.
The only thing you could be remanded is that England first gave Jonathan Trott the chance in Caribbean — although Lyth was in the best form — but this disgusting opportunity is already a past.
Alex Hales comes, and this is a bullet that I appreciate very positively.
It's a x-factory cricket player that we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he got 236 on the Trent Bri's game that did so little.
He must be offered at least the same opportunity as his predecessors have received, but all of this will, of course, depend on the total construction of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts on the side of Cooka, which would get another extra spinner while keeping four quicks, was overtaken and I have no winning against her.
I don't understand why strokemaker can't burn, and this left man has already shown that he's a spectacular cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them, and the large range is not in it.
My former team colleague Justin Langer first played 38 tests before his exhibition in 2001.
Immediately, he was in three centuries, and he didn't even look at him.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a basic spinner and when I had the opportunity to follow him, he taught me as a very active young man.
People can look at his groves — a middle of 31 with a paw and 35 with a sword — and I see it as a practice, but there are no spinners who would lift up their hands, and the electors decided for the youth.
They're learning much about this tour.
In addition to the team, England seems to have made a number of changes and smart supplements to their training staff.
The name of Mahela Jayawardenea, Mr. Lanka's carrier, as a conservant for test stocks may be a mysterious tach.
He is one of the most beautiful boys who will bring rich experiences by having experience with all submins and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in a part of the white-ball tour and brings into the team both energy, so unfriendly ice.
I always felt that he was born directly in the world of international cricket, either as a player or a trainer, and as Mahela has a intellect to use.
The new voices in the shadow, although these are the voices that say consistent things that have been spoken before, may sometimes delay and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham Ben Stokes' partner got a single-day freedom, like Root's got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many are inadequate, trainers and selectors don't create a harmonisation.
And you have to remember, as players, that their jobs depend on outputs.
Such decisions can never be taken to light weight.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate until 2017.
David Cameron's undeserved renegotiation strategy for the destruction of British in the EU is going to face further problems with the next day and without the choice of the genial Jeremy "Is this Yes or No?" Corbyn to the front of the Partial Party, or the TUC will take the whole round of Europe on Sunday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
The close friend of the European diplomate has recently explained how Europe will suffer in various crisiss - from which not all are their wine - some Member States have already enough British egocentric agendas, shared concessions and disruptive changes with which they did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided that they wouldn't want it even if they had cold social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George's self-agenda.
Premier and officer goes to summits or bilateral meetings in metropolis, makes a cup before a glorious local monument, with or without local officers, and then returns home with the words that wins a community for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants the uninvited British in Europe - "Don't hold us with France," says Berlin - indicates that some short-screen ministers and officers in some major cities have reached the point where they are not interested in our department.
Angela Merkel, a German carefully equilibred officer, is an associated officer, but she was at the power of 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad, as it was in that of the too continued Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohla (16).
Francouz François Holland is responsible for rehabilitation or replacement in 2017.
His power is too falling.
Polish may have a national government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to look at how they laugh their feet by helping Selfy Brits, who could better invest their energy to protect Scotland from the UK -- which is something they don't want because they have similar separatist trends.
So some of these ministers can plan relatively unusual notes of SNP during the campaign before the referendum 2017 in Britain to accelerate the Brexit process, a friend.
"Repeat negotiations resolved the problem" and "Brittannian has nothing to be worth of negotiating."
Europeans for their own captivity how fleet Street can be and how skeptics towards the EU are pressure oligarch barons because they were not during the reference of Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in relation to 2:
They may remember the name of Boris Johnson, an amazing Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels reporter "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the ninety-years.
Although Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture of unpaid taxes, foreign hacking phones and pseudo non-sea departments that owned the majority of newspapers.
Tony Blair thought the same about them, but he realized that when you're in the coat with a hot gorilla, you've got to take the bananas so that you don't have you to dinner and then to the tea.
In the area, Miliband was more like Blair than the Blair alone when he opposed Cameron's reference routine since Blair admitted the EU's constitutional principle, which was tortured by French and the Netherlands electors in 2005 and received a card of exhaust.
The print never forgave him too.
But the dear Jeremy Corbyn, who bought me friendly in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he shouldn't lose time for me anymore - it seems to be in danger of readmissing the strategy of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake at that time and now.
It may take a long time, but it is to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose chair was left by BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official position towards Europe, I'll say it mildly, is developing.
He claims he wants to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people, outside the disturbing trends of Ukip and the wild coasts of Tory's small Englanders, can certainly come to this.
The same thing Hilary said "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn in the Family and TV this week when his internal shadow couldn't decide to admit that the name of Corby's abrasive McDonnell was a bad decision.
It reminded me in the 70 ’ s when his old father was fighting in television for his loyalty, without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's defeat was much more attractive.
But fighting for it, and they remained "in all circumstances" - Bennina's phrase - according to all, it wasn't what McDon said or what JC said to the colleagues and sent to their private meeting on Monday evening,
Whatever the background is, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to communicate - don't forget, he also touched me - the discipline of the news remains important in the whole day TV transport and particularly in the faith, the paranoia and traitorship that are social media
It is just not to provide Cameron's free entry into Europe that would enable him to consider the support of the Partial Party in the reference campaign, as McDon's stated.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnellovo and Corbyno's basic maintenance on membership in the EU - in accordance with Bennite's economic, anti-capitalistic past - it is no longer a question of the isothern debate between the left disidents, for which the narcissism is a central basis for dogmatic hazard.
Like his manipulation about Nato - Tom Watson, he is convinced that the JC campaign wants to end - the promotional diplomates will be forced to try to understand the sense of all of this for their homelords.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose politics - also have suspicious electors - because of the concession of Britain, when it seems to be inevitable?
The United States are already very disappointed from the British "bad military execution in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when decreasing the costs of preserving the government at the power, as I was noted on Monday beginning of something called the British Security Forum of the Effect.
Experts criticize reviews on the public public agency Public Health England
The statement by the Government financed by the agency that electronic cigarettes are 95 % safer than smoke has resulted from the meeting of 12 people from which some have a link to tobacco industry, refers to researchers.
Writing experts in British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet the criticism of evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by the Public Health Agency (PHE).
The PHE Agency has published the "greenhouse" report last month and described it as "complex evidence review".
However, several researchers doubted the content of data and warned about the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The leader in the professional magazine Lancet, last month, attacked the "motherly chatting base", on which the PHE agency found its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for BMJ have doubted the statement "build on rock or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at London High School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of integrity."
It states that the public could expect that the PHE Agency's statement, which sounds "the best estimation, is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less damage than smoking" are based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In this context, the conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 persons authorised to process the analysis of the multi-kriterium decision (MCDA) model to synthetise their views on damage related to different products containing nikotin; the results of the process were included in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose general director has already previously received financial contributions from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the approval of the public health of the BAT in the sustainability report.
One of the 12 meetings acknowledged financing from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the financing that was evidently obtained by the Philip Morris International tobacco company.
D’It is not available for the selection of members of the panel, but they contain a number of known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of which also announce industrial financing in newspapers.
Some other attendants at the meeting are not known for their professional knowledge in the fight against smoking.
Meeting in the PHE was also involved in the tobacco leadership.
The report appeared in this group "consciously admits", lacking "fast evidence of the damage of the products for the majority of the criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, no of these references or restrictions is described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE claims that "not yet any evidence that e-cigarettes would act as a roadway for children or incorruptibles," it was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, manager of health and well-being in PHE, noted that the BMJ statement was already responsible before.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are essentially less damage than smoking."
One of the two birds of life will die because of its dependence.
All evidence indicates that the health risks represented by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to examine it.
The PHE has the obligation to inform the public of what evidence shows and what they do not show, especially when there was so much public estimation about relative dangers in comparison with tabac.
The number of 80 000 people dies annually in the case of smoking and smoking are NHS £2 billion per year.
Clearly highlighting the current evidence - even though e-cigarettes are not without risk, they are only wearing a breakdown of the damage caused by smoking - we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should end with EastEnders, former director Channel 4
Ex-director Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "do the right hand" for hit shows like Albert Square.
Johnson said the license payment should be used only for programs that are not created by other British television.
The BBC criticized that she set up public services programmes, which will probably follow only the worst of people, in the complicated time sending, rather than his rivals, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the general director Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to make more partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he failed to try to connect to BBC for six years he worked on Channel 4.
"I fight with the idea that the BBC provides and sends programmes that would certainly be sent to rivals without State contributions," Johnson said in the Communication Committee on Top-Shopping, as part of the BBC's future negotiations.
If you keep licensed taxes that I am not sure whether they are in the middle or horizontally good ideas, the creation should be reduced at least as regards programmes that are not produced or not.
They send The Voice in the main sending of time because they want to get the widest of my support in the future.
The idea that nobody else would send him is a funny shot, and it is incomprehensible.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why returning tax should support programmes that can be financed without contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and understandablely produced on home ground.
Only other channels would give them the right hand quietly.
I can't understand how these public transmission services are.
I don't think that would even weak BBC at least.
Johnson, a businessman in the series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that BBC felt guilty by getting ratings "to the ambition of people who worked here and because he believed that it was the best way to ensure support."
His comment on the most famous BBC shows repeat those who were the former Executive Director of Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart Lection in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest BBC sold a show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even more nice programs of the BBC public service "come to BBC4, where they can't raise the community, but they are full of their rights and they can argue if they want their cover mission to justifie £4bn from license payments, "But, of course, we do all these obscure programmes that no one looks at."
They're sending them in the time when no one looks at them.
As regards the license payment, Johnson said to the Commission, "I invite you to find the more regressive system about who will get the best value from.
We all think that 150 British frees per year are a large amount, but for people who are 150 pounds a lot, I would wonder if they paid so much because they don't say to BBC.
The former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who went up before the commission on Tuesday, said BBC should revise its reit mission in the meaning of "inform, educate and enjoy".
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production was now classified as educational -- it was 1% of TV production and 0.1% in the day -- and it should be taken as a pattern of public public transmission in Australia and Canada and changed to "inform, explain and entertainment".
To the theme of the partnership Elstein said BBC should do more in  firs such as Proms, which were sent on the television only a throat, and connect to commercial reporters, and they all could see them online.
‘Son’ means control of brain cells using sound vln
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction to which glacists move.
Scientists grew up with geneticly modified nervous system that can control the sound wings.
Small lighting changes the direction at the moment when the sound impulses are injured, which are unhearable for human ears.
The pulses work so that they exchange genetic cells of modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasound wings.
Relative: Scientists can read and record brain activity through light
Scientists have noticed that these reds are a great demonstration of new methods called sonietics that use ultrasound to activate brain, heart cells and swallow cells and are active outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher from Salk Institute in La Jolla in California, stated for the Guardian journal that one day this method could replace the deep brain stimulation - invasion and the procedure in which the patient’s brain is adjusted to electricity that stimulate the brain. The method is used for the treatment of the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
The glasses are usually not reacting to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reactions will be obtained when they are placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, the bubbles strengthen ultrasound waves that then pass through the red bodies.
Powerful ultrasound waves operate in ion TRP-4 channels, which are located in the membranes of some red cells.
With sound wings, these channels are opened and activated by cells that are connected are listed in the report of Nature Communications.
In order to control the lighting through ultrasound waves, Chalasani geneticly modified the red so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
Then, when he used this modified ultrasound wheels, the sound wings were strengthened by microbublins and transferred into reds where the modified motor neurons have been changed.
The new method is in many ways similar to optogenetic, an ecological tool that allows the doctors to switch and switch neurons through light.
But Chalasani lets him hear that songs may have much advantage from this technology.
In a distance from the light which must be sent by optical flash to the requested place in the brain, ultrasound wings may be caused without restriction and directly sent to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic virus, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that its application would also be found in the treatment of sulphur cells and in-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your dust!
Inserates of the British trade with weapons.
Look at the video on the anti-weapon market from Amnesty International.
A terrible murderer drone!
The eye on the feet that swallow the kitchens!
Fucking shots!
And electrically cycling clothes that cause insufficient pain, but that doesn't have any traces!
The glad voice and metafor carrier does not allow anyone to doubt that this advertising on the biggest world weapons is a slight parodia created for Amnesty International in order to highlight the britain government's will to sell weapons to repressive regimes through defense and security units in the ExCeL Centre in the London quarter of Docklands.
Relative: DSEI of the commander's weapons: Authority regimes are meeting London
However, a single campaign is also conducted with the explosion of plates on bus stops and metres that require a second view.

One of the advertising parodies made by the special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavina Grindon, the curriculum Designs and the professional assistant at the University of Essex, artists are still more suspicious and trying to show political activity to the birds outside the gallery.
Many artists are going to work with the activists in protest movements, and they realize that they have to get out in the real world to have their art impact on society.

Video Amnesty was monitored on Facebook for more than 100 000 people in 24 hours and was created by VCCP worker agent without charge and graphic designer and commenter also worked freely.
The Creative Director VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by silently circumcisive advertising on trade with weapons - he saw an empty place in the ExCeL calendar - and said, "Let us show them a campaign that is trying to avoid."
They played with the creation of realistic more riskable fire advertisements, but "to add petroleum colors and animations, I've been able to get more people."
"They took a fantastic cup of work and helped us get anxiety about the sale of illegal torture tools on the field," said Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we now do is that the Government of the United Kingdom takes measures and ensures that the torture equipment does not act illegally on our dust.
The most creative art that surrounds the trade with weapons comes outside ExCeL, where the manufacturer sells fantastic eufemistic products.
In the print report, Saab discovered the statement from the American Army on "on the AT4CS RS burning frame".

11 years ago, I moved to the student's school as an incredible nineteen-year-old boy, still playing in bars and moral relatives, but now I get out of the drinking smiles of those to whom I used - and the fair, deep complaints to the other.
All I learned can be destilled in eight simple rules.
Movement to the rail can be moved from quietly to the nerves that go to completely disturbing.
It's an amazing blob: tell people where you are, if you've taken a pause year, what you're thinking about Corbyn and why "You don't really love or do not just hate Marmit, because people, it's just an extract from the hahaha, I'll be in my room."
Deeply breathe.
And help the finals to take them too - ask yourself and show interest.
It's the way of conversing and helping you find people you have, and those with whom you wouldn't enjoy, even if your rows were in one fire, and they would have issued the hazardous devices.
Leave people's space.
People's rooms are often changed to drinking receptions, film dinners and public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and adjust their beach.
Relative: Don't even think that you'd start walking high and be related
Introvertises will come quickly.
Your room should be a campaign, however, the railway changes to a foreign cross-border culture that is friendly, socially and contributes to a whole lifetime friendship.
It may be a hell for someone who offers himself.
No culture allows you to say, "I have you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to go back to the energy I needed to talk with you."
Try to know when the companion is exhausted from socialization - and maybe you write him in place of closing.
When it's talking about the cluster: Clean.
One boy in my rows had the habit that if the door isn't locked, he's invited inside.
He saw a few things.
Make your friends grateful to you.
Because you started walking to the university at the top of the cocktail, locking on the foreign door, and presenting with the feet of the broken cups, it seems inevitably less weird than "Welcome in the neighborhood, something I've stuck you, now laugh as I'm going to ask for personal questions."
It's a good way to get friends.
Your partners will feel aware of talking to you, and maybe everything will end so that your face will join a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it's the subject of you're a decent peker.
Wrong condensed bottles of fat, sugar and tumour will probably prevent the finals of the sleep when you try to stick them at the door.
The stole of eating is on the student's schools with a running crime.
The stealing of the whole cow is, of course, a crime, but is a hole of milk in your tea stealing?
Twice check it with the milk owner.
There's a chance that milk will offer you even if they're inside.
Somebody will steal you something, it's cruel and you have my sympathy - but try to arrange a little more adult than my partner, who has changed her milk as a feet on the mixture of a vessel to get the evil.
Now he's in the campaign.
You shouldn't do sounds that break people from sleep or study.
It's not just a decent human being, but you're also a story of people in wooden houses.
The girl from my neighborhood asked her if they could quiet the drum and bass because they were three nights and had a letter.
Their answer was the strengthening of music.
When they finally relaxed at 5 hours, she let them sleep calmly for two hours, and then she left her own music voice, locked the door and went to her three-hour letter.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future walked on the same road like you?
But wouldn't it be extremely disgusting if you were to join your partners for your future even though, they slept together, went away, and had to see each day, and maybe she would also take control of your common friends?
Of course, you don't advise your hearts - but if your sex of partners is not your future, try at least a little to talk to your weaknesses.
At a remarkable moment when you realize that someone left the keys in his unlocked room, it's only a warm limit between shaking and shaking.
It's a good shit, but it's easily.
Learn them valuable and funny lessons about their security by hiding something to them - never destroy some room with the teeth and champion.
Close the door to them and put the keys to them in the ship with water, which you then shoot into the coat - but never let their stuff go to them more than twice.
Eva enjoyed the two boys even with an incredible view of the future.
Eva has experienced a cruel moment in pregnancy with the seven - year Witch today.
His father went out with her, and she was alone to prepare and grow.
I've been compared to a relatively relatively - I've been very pleased with the child and looked for a positive.
I'm not sure and I'm alone with my child, I didn't try to hurt.
And I was sure that we would not stay alone, he takes Eva to her first pregnancy today.
She already met on the Internet at the chat of your elder, who began to talk about favorite movies.
Your Eve and Witke have even brought home from the family, but he has not been too involved in the role of the unrighteous dad.
"For a while he got down from the program," she described in the documentary series Four in that 3.
The third series of the Czech TV series is just looking for happiness for the second trial.
For Witka and the family’s financial security, she had been able to work on a part of the account and great help of her mother and her tate's help.
No view of the responsibility for the foreign child finally showed your inclination to Eve.
Definitely, they have been thrown around the other birthdays of Victoria, and this now understands Vaska as their father and also celebrates him.
Though you already have two adult daughters, your fathers in sixty are enjoying according to their words, and your children are more interested in it.
Besides Witka, there came two-year-old Leontine and finally two-year-old.
"The widow entered our family so naturally, maybe even because my mother never spoke to me in relations," she thinks she smiles.
A little place?
At least we're close.
Ema and Ela were born as the Caesarian series after Eve was finally pregnant with a pregnancy cholestase.
This is the damage of the production and activity of yellow acids, which are then produced in excessive quantities of pregnancy in the blood and in particular by witnessing.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fruit that threatens premature birth and death, in the mother after birth, it is self-releasing.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Evina and Vasca, even when they were first in the 36th week.
Emmask was placed in the incubator in the intermediate division, where Vaszkov netherer works, who could take and stay.
Elinka was greater and immediately after I was transported from JIP to room, I had her at my own, she described the period after the birth of Eva.
She spent twenty days in the family until the doctors were allowed to leave the kids that had been able to reach the limits of two kilos.
Waiting for the kids' collection in Eve's family, the joy was not done.
"I was foolish by a husband and a kid," she called on a hard ch's at the sixth-day division of a four-fold mother.
She also considered a reverse signature with her husband, otherwise because of an insensitive access to one of the physicians.
But finally, it wasn't done, and the doctors left Eve and the two boys in the home care.
The events of four pregnancy and birth sent TT1 on Wednesday evening at 21:45 hours.
The whole major family is able to protect.
They live together in a small house near the Prague, where Eva had to get up with electrical double-droped and tissued submines.
Although the house hasn't increased, your joy made Eve happy by installing a gas cotton to be prepared for six persons more pleasant.
If it's worse, we'll get a taxi.
Eve is convinced that children are primarily taking into account family events and a pleasant atmosphere, not the size or degradation of the house.
During that time, we've been very nice, better than we've waited.
Although the degree is upwardly hidden in the small space and we sometimes cross the kidney, but at least all of us are near, Eva is laughing, who can find a position on each side.
Your work lighter at the movie is not a regular income guarantee.
That's why sometimes it goes to the Prague Streets as a taximan.
In his sixty years, according to his words, family financial care and children are physically controlled, how will that be?
"I realize that because of our difference, I will be one time who will live this family," Eve admits at the level of questioning about the future.
She would like to return to the employment, but she would like to keep her own business.
With four kids, I'm not just a terno for employees.
And when it's worst, we can get a taxi with our husband and I, uh, guess, a sympathic blond.
Apple put it on his effect.
They can screen for everything.
The most executive processor, the camera with a higher solution, the stronger chase or the display of recognition of the touching force, are in the shorter preferences of recently represented iPhons of the nineth generation.
The last two have also a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of iPhons 6s and 6s Plus.
Applu's experienced trend was that every new generation of iPhonu is easier than the previous.
Only the third and fourth generations, whose weight was deeply increased by previous iPhons.
The two-gram division weight in the injuries of the news was, however, increasing.
However, this is not remote for new iPhons.
In contrast to remote iPhons 6 and 6 Plus the same weight has grown in a smaller model of 14 grams, and then about a total of 20 grams.
On the one hand, it can't be surprised, the lonely affairs in Apple's caps has been greatly shot.
The newspaper is so far from a 7000-dithering cyclic slider, which also was broadcast on the weight.
But a lot of more impact on her has a screen.
Apple also used 3D Touch in the newspaper, using the displays recognize the strength of touch.
To this end, the display needed to take care of the other levels of capacity sensors.
The weight of the new iPhon displays, so unfortunately, in the previous generations, has increased more than double.
In less than 12 grams of iPhon in 29 grams, in case of 19 to 40 grams.
In iPhonu 6s, it is the most difficult to use the component.
The weight of only 143 grams has then been achieved in this news also by the recycling core that touched the frequency of the remaining components.
The most difficult element of the battery is then in the model, but its weight has not changed.
Even in this case, the biggest growth is clear at the screen.
The weight 5.5" iPhonu 6s Plus is 192 grams.
As long as the new display will be practical, it will be shown to use.
They will be able to test it on Friday 25 September when the sale of iPhons 6s and 6s Plus will be started in the selected countries.
Are the bottles feeding champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grott Pagli, archaeologists have found that opens interesting options.
They discovered the traces of a modern person from different times, including adequate males, the rest of tools, and so further and so similar.
In the level 23A, which has been data for about 30 thousand years ago, but that has been discovered by those who have found something that is very important for the rest of the dinner buffet.
At the same place, the trailers of ovens were found, which evidently passed through the process of production of so-target flags today.
It's going to be the first hour today, then it's dry, it'll save the pack, it's a pull, then it's falling down, and it's throwing up.
In the Pagli's box, it was able to discover the wind that was embraced or covered according to all, and then apparently divorced between two milk stones - at least that testifies the feet of use on two stones in the hall.
Therefore, scientists could not conclude in their PNAS magazine that the completion process of the production of sticks would be carried out in the box, but the similarity is very ideaal.
We also have no evidence of how people were able to eat, but thinking that it was with a fluid and a lot of warm, of course, offers a whole logic.
In addition, it is a very interesting evidence of how people intensely used vegetables for a long time before agriculture appears.
It is the same tolerance that the oldest bottles have passed in agriculture for about twenty thousand years.
New report of stations in the Carrier Business City Brn.
So I listened again to report the name of the trolley bus: Hâjakkava, Example, Frazova, Spratecka.
Of course, the trolleybus was sometimes more sound, so the reporting with a man's voice was sometimes less comprehensive than before when the stops were reported with a woman's voice.
Women's voice is higher, so in the deepest sound of transportation it is better known than the deepest man's voice.
Although DPMB arguments that this voter has chosen travellers themselves - I don't know who, nobody asked me, but they have certainly chosen from the study records set up in a full silence, which, of course, sounded pretty different than in the bus engine museum.
I have lived in Brna for a few beautiful decades of years, so the right names of all these detentions can be remembered, so I don't have this report, but foreigners who do not recognize themselves in Brna and for whom these reports are designed primarily can be deteriorated and can be deterrented at the end of where they came, and then say that the delay they had to come was not reported at all.
Maybe the choice of a voter - but better the voter again - would make it again, and this time the colored with a running transport sound and the engine's shot in which the player's kicking in the bus is losing.
And they didn't have to keep listening to the names of the Water Herspice Station, Smirova, or then Ponorna in the griping shot that I stopped in Komarov.
I guess my elderly listener didn't get so scared once during the one day when the voter changed the statement.
Before that day, I understanded the reports very well.
Goodbye, Chief Court.
From the trace records.
Today, a few people know what the biggest and smartest of the governments have been, i.e., complex tests.
I allowed me to take it.
The bus was late.
I entered the dinner office at the moment when I saw that it was just seven hours.
"You're lucky that you haven't joined the companion of the chief, came a minute before you, and it seems that it's not just an injury," noted the divorce, while I was recorded in the book of arrivals.
Thank you, I'll give me a kid.
Write me that I'm going on the circuits to review a little mechanism.
It won't happen, it's a test today.
Everyone's fucking crazy.
What's actually going on?
"But you'll see," the divorce swore.
You'll be next to it.
I went out to the bathroom.
Then the door of the headquarters opened up and the chief found himself.
Beautied with a stone face, in the perfectly falling steadfast.
"Good, Mr. Chief," I saluted honestly, and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"Good," she replied, and I've gone to the second patrol, unless I realized the cold, cruel tone that the old man answered.
"You're playing," welcomed me, Eve's engineer, the older lady I've appreciated very much.
She even was the chief before the companions met her.
They're tests, and you'll get a tactic.
How many times I asked what these complex tests are, but no one wants to talk about it.
It seems to be one time in three years, all of them have to be, and it's pretty inappropriate.
At least for some.
I'll see it.
I got out of the puzzle fascicle with periodic reports and then the phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me right now," the chief voice answered.
What's going on?
Now we've met and nothing..." I'm kidding, but no one answered me, everyone with his own thoughts.
"Good day, cousin Chief, I came to your order," I deceived, I wasn't getting into the headquarters.
The chief was sitting behind the board and watching a letter.
"The Court of Mechanizer," he said after a minute, without lifting his head up and keeping carefully watching this letter, "Your behavior doesn't like me at all."
He threw the leaf on the table, cut himself into the board, and he kept looking on me with a clothing, unpleasant, bad, picking view.
I was disappointed.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the campaign praised me that in these months, I worked very well and that he was satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well when he dropped me out of the chat on the distance.
And now this?
You know that you're a trace distant technician and you have to be doing it.
The salute you used today is just inacceptable.
I was surprised that I used such a salute from childhood that I was so old and that I didn't see anything wrong on him.
On the chief, it was like a red hacker on a crocane.
"You're on the socialist railway and the only acceptable salute is the honour of the job," was buried by the conscious chief.
Moreover, you're still playing the celebration of the overseers.
One time you'll say "sir" and "subsequent" again.
But I'm not a chief for you, but a judge.
The companions are companions, the top travellers are companions of top travellers!
Remember that!
Excuse me, Mr.... Council, but... but I welcomed you with a running citizen's salute.
But there's nothing wrong... and it's the honor of work, or a companion... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your advantage that you're not on the side," the chief who was a little quiet.
But it's still gonna be talking about it.
Remember everyone that you don't have the staff on the top in the income.
It wasn't good.
When the chief said to someone that something was not his advantage, it didn't look well with the person concerned.
For a while, I was in a cold, cool view, and I was looking for the words I would answer.
I'm also worried about his highly touching.
He was just a couple of years older and played a god, actually a companion of God.
Wood, foolish, authoritative, arrogant how it was right now.
He's all made it.
Wait, he's a chief.
In fact, not everyone, the president of the partnership organization, as all the parties, but also the non-pageers, he was running.
But the chief was running to many, especially to those who could apply his supernaturality.
He's just kidnapped me for a full hole.
I thought something about the fuck, and I was worth a lot of shooting to not shoot him into the kitchen.
But I wouldn't have to go back to the crowd, so I'd continue to do a travel officer.
What would I enjoy two kids from?
And that's a disgusting boy!
I've been wearing, but I've controlled myself.
I won't make him this joy.
"It's all, you can go," finished the audience, the chief, and started to watch the league that he had before in his hand.
They've been calling me at half of the twelve.
All of the offices were there and asked what and how, they replied that it would be good.
Only Jožin's cousin's way was his habit that they can't all exterminate us because he had to make a judge of his own own head, and that he would not be threatened.
Then he highlighted the word "subduct" as if he did what the old man shot me for.
It was a nice collection in the main place.
Judge the chief after his writing table and at the long advisory table other companions who had to decide about my office or not.
Cadrava, President ROH, a personal recorder, a special referendum, something in the way of combating the military, and the officer, my boss.
And the most important person, the President of the Partnership Organization.
I knew him out of the shot.
A usual trace-worker, he's thrown the puzzle or a screw-screen.
But also an ex-baccher.
It was heard that there was no shit with him that time, like a beautiful beast.
The bad languages claimed that he went out the school in the seventh class, he didn't learn anything, he didn't know anything.
And when the crime was canceled, he ended on the cow in the crown.
But the judge, yeah, the court was cut off!
The chief invited me to sit down.
I was a little bitch in my neck.
The carrier has read the sentence from the Civil Committee from the residence.
I'm out of a business family, I'm married, two kids, and so further and so far.
Before it's good, I thought, and I had a little better breathe.
Then a review from the Street Organization of the Party.
He copied the case from the civil committee, perhaps both of them wrote the same person.
But then it happened!
Parents of the Member States, refused to be delivered before the examination committee, and followed by the parties, particularly from health care.
The chief looked at me.
The cartridge observed it and stopped reading.
The chief commanded to continue.
It was just worse.
I was a member of the town committee of SSM, and I was obtained there for the candidate of the party.
Notwithstanding parents who went up from the side, the party gave me confidence.
But I married, and I had a wedding outside the National Committee, too in the church.
I've disappointed my confidence in the worst way.
That's why I was exposed to a number of her candidates.
But it's gone!
I made both kids baptized, and even my mother, when she died, told the church to be buried, even though it was an ancient member of the party.
This is what I give to all a negative position to the leading role of the party.
When the cartridge was read, only the shopping of the chief pig into the table was interrupted by the tired silence.
Everyone was looking at me upright, and I wanted to be a lot far away somewhere.
Instead, I continued to say, "Communists, superlionists, communists, superlionists." What did I do?
Why didn't I have ra'i stayed at the boxes?
I could just fix the exhausts, even without a division of tests.
But now?
The travel officer's career took her before she started.
Go back to the chat?
I'm sure that's not going to go. The chief's gonna get me out for a hour.
"The Court, how did you check the negotiated council here?", interrupted the drunk silent head of the question on the box.
Well, according to the previous job.
Do you have him here?
It wasn't obviously too many times.
He's throwing the roof, nervous, as if he was tested himself.
He bitterly touched and gave a paper to the chief.
"No," said the chief with a sign of magic, which often was the preconceiving of the storm.
In the first view, the same praise, learned with the nomination, studied the industrial, worked in the job salary as a guardian, fulfilled the standard in the meaning of a hundred twenty per cent.
It's just a basic degree.
Where did you take the trial, my companion?" He turned back to a box, who felt that it would begin to turn against him and that he wouldn't have to be a chairman very soon.
This is the court that gave me, at the time of the coming.
That's enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the roof into the cheet," he locked the box.
And there's no demand for the deals. He's been somewhat more, so I put it to him in the directory.
"So, when you enter into the technology, this chart was enough for you," the chief found dry.
The cartridge was nervous and he had no answer.
"It's okay, we're going to negotiate the position," the chief claimed the matter, and the cadrows were obviously disappointed.
I mean, it's a little bit.
"What about you, buddy?" The chief returned to me.
It's once to me, that's the end!
I was darkened in my eyes, I was warm.
He followed the accusation and accusation, and I thought I was the most resistant creation in the world that does not deserve self-compassion.
That by subtracting an incomplete test, I introduced a mistake of the referendum, and I didn't understand why the trial was incomplete when I got it from the cartridge in the manufacture.
I am also an antisocialist life that supports the religious darkness of religion during the construction of real socialism.
That it was what I did, or maybe I was still sleeping and praying quietly to finish.
I've been worried about everything.
I was worried about flying out of the mechanizer's place.
I was worried they'd take my cow too.
It's a job for honest and honest people, not for the enemies of the people I was in the eyes of the chief.
"So it would be enough, coach of the chief," the president of the party replied once and broke the heads of the Levites.
Here the judge made a mistake, a huge error.
What a mistake, he just did the stupid thing!
But he's already getting his punishment!
Don't worry about it, Chief Coach!
What might be worse for a young man than to close the door to his side for time!
In order to open him again, he will have to prove that he has changed that he is worth our trust again.
An unfair bacaer spoke as a book.
Where did it take?
Is he so numerated or papa's a phrase from partner schools and meetings?
That is why this young judge must also get a chance from us!
The chances to prove that he has changed.
And who's going to give him it if you're not just, Chief?
It is your obligation to support this young man, truly, sometimes a misguided companion, in his efforts to rectify!
It's your side obligation that no one will save you!
In fact, it's a side obligation to all of us.
This court must see that the side of it has not forgotten.
That as a lovely mother, she is not just punishing, but also loved.
When the president ended, no one even listened.
No one expected such a turnover.
At least me.
"I'm totally agreed with you, Country President," the chief ice attacked in trying to take the initiative again.
If you let me talk, you'd hear that I was just looking for that conclusion.
Everyone had the heads agreed, but it was on them to see that they didn't even believe him.
"So I was confirmed for the self-reporting reporter's care of the basic," I insisted on returning to the office and retreated.
Besides Eve's engineers, they all were at dinner.
The silent listened to my independent number of fresh lives, and I was calm in the meantime.
When I finished, she asked if I could get a coffee.
Without waiting for the answer, she put water on the wheel and wanted to screw.
Meanwhile, she talked about covering practices.
Like one trial, often full of praise, they give the man into their hands, and the other, where there is a spine, they send to the new employer.
But I didn't finish where I had, but on the coach of the krum, so the companions of the fabric didn't know where to send it.
What about our cartridge?
It's just old where he would eat or drink, and then it finally realized how it happened.
"It's from the old shit," she noticed misunderstandingly.
I'm sure he's gonna get to him today.
Take care of him as well, he's pretty cool.
And the partner president?
In fact, a far worse chief, no human being.
Zero from the crown of a crowd with great power.
The water on the coffee started to shoot, and the office was filled with the oven just drunk coffee.
I put into the coat of sugar, and the silence mixed a warm electroid.
I hope I'm out of the worst outside.
Now I'm not going out, and other tests are in three years.
Everyone, the judge will not forget me this day.
Anthology LITERAT ARTICLES II. in EPIKA
The symbol of the forest is alive.
It's about a crowd over Chlum, and it's going back after years.
It's seeing far away because it's placed at 15 meters high store.
People in the broad area call him "the wind on Chlum".
For the province, 150 residents became even one of the elements of the general sign that had been obtained to the opportunity of the parent meeting in 2010.
"We asked for a sign then, and we wanted to have a sign, of course, knowing him around everyone," observed the elder Jiří Mašek.
Clumic cockpit is a local technical memory.
It's so little to the mement of the present: at the same time when people today were fighting for the quality of drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a frequency.
By 1910, Clumic representatives decided to solve the solutions that were then held up to the half of the eighty years.
In the neighborhood of Chich's offices, they allowed a seven meters of deep powder.
In three years after the coat, the coat was added to the cotton with a cup of coat, which was cut water into the reservation at the highest point of the foreign, near the church.
"Stabba has carried out Antonin Kunc from the Greencast on Moravia with a cost of 2 400 coron," states the memory record on the landscape of the stock.
A number of works and a road falls in 1971.
On 7 May 1973, it began to write new water battle: that day in Chlum began to serve a new waterwater.
The wind wheat has already remained only a non-economic general symbol and a rarit.
The dominant was carried out at the aeroplane of the parents' meeting.
By 2008, Chlumski decided that the round would be re-effected and re-induced.
They allowed to produce a replica of a p'e's wheel - decreased in the meaning of a half meter.
When he was seated on the stone, however, the same year had to be brought down.
The manufacturer of the replica did not allow a suitable material and the road was not supposed to touch the fractions of the replica.
Then the cloud dominant was relaxed for a few years under the shore.
Since June, however, the round on the high holder is again running.
At the opportunity of the parent's meeting, she left the replica to the road and replaced it on the top of the railway position.
But the round of the chirr is a pleasant water from the source only to the past blind arm.
And in the year, we locked him out, because there was a little water in the cotton.
It was at least empty.
"Therefore, on the top of the wheel of the wheel from the wheel in the washing, we will reconnect again," explained Mašek.
Chlum is not the only community in Czechland where a round has been reached in the general character, but is the only wheel of this kind at the whole Highness.
Similar element in the sign has the honor of local technical memories, for example, in Chvalkovick and Green Mountains in Biscow, in Kugel in Hodoninsk, Partutuvies in Prerovska or Police in Vsetinska.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafat, admitted the opposition of Tripolis Goian.
"I remember very well, and my, like all in my career," laughed the 34-year Goian on pre-scale printing.
That time, George Hagi trained us, it was nice that we lost.
I hope I'll give Sparte now.
Only with the difference that we don't lose this time," Goian continued.
Just this man, who has excited 60 reactions for the Romanian representation, is a key opposition to the Greek team.
As a stair, he's going to take up Sparban officials.
There's a couple of thousands of people, no hell, talking about the Greek companion Spanish Hybsh.
And partly, he thinks what he can wait on Thursday evening.
Well, I know Fataie, who played in the Romanian Astr with my brother Lucian.
At that time, I saw all their stocks.
I know he's a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta too, he said Goian.
Other Balists of the Prague Club did not name, so the question came if he knew David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Sparty.
Goian laughed, and with a easily calculating view, he measured the Czech journalist.
An unconscious expression in the face mean, "Why do you ask me about it?"
He left quiet for a minute.
We saw a video and I noticed Sparta plays a lot of team.
He's got a good player.
The Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone else except Fataia.
It's a very good idea about Goian.
"I have experiences from more clubs, you can say that it holds the defence of Asteras, it's their organizer of games," observed Spanish assistant Stanislav Haykal.
Goian has the best year after him, but it can be comforted by a very interesting ball lifebook.
At the time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both of the United and City Manchester generals, from Steauy, but moved to the Italian Palerm, played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggression and an unusual, says the trainer.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European fires, pere about victory in Czech Lisa.
It's a favorite for me in this bag, but we play home and we want the group to start a good outcome.
Like Sparta, we'll try to win, Goian said.
I'm in the room with the Slovenian master Tomás Kosjik, who's very happy in the opposite of Czechland.
I too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight firmly.
Kofola moves from Poland to Czechland, considers the entrance in the Prague Burge.
The new seat should have Kofola in the island.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland from the trade of the company's shares in the Warsaw Burge.
Our primary goal is to have a group seat in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have undertaken during the project are mainly legal and administrative and have no real impact on actions in the company, says Daniel Burish, the Cofol Group's financial director.
"In relation to the movement of the seats of the group, shareholders consider the location of action on the Prague Burge."
As a result of the entry into the Prague Value Paper, the company ends the prospect of a value paper which will present the Czech National for approval at the nearest time.
The movement of holding seats and related transaction transfers will be performed by the form of non-public transaction by participating only existing shareholders.
This operation therefore offers any action to register the public or new investors.
"The proposal for action to new investors would be performed - if the company and its shareholders would decide - and it would be either on 4 February 2015 or on 1st Friday 2016," said the company.
The company has already stated that the eventual offer of action could be consistent of new actions or sales of existing actions.
This offer could be made from a proposal for action in the village in the Czech Republic and Poland, which is, in particular, the location of action and the Varsuebourg.
Testing objectivity of the Czech TV in information about migration crisis.
Other small test of objectivity and export of the main Czech media reporting on fucking crisis.
This time, sending the main reporting session of the Czech TV.
How did she stand?
When journalists learn about how media can manipulate reality, they can leave today's transmission of the Czech TV events.
The migration crisis was cancelled about 80% of reporting.
On the first minute, when the CT informed about the disasters in Serbia and Hungary border and the attacks of the migrants to the police called Euphemisticks, they came to them with patience - they dropped the stones and attacked the metals, it was now the migration propaganda - see the names of individual reporters.
Critics of non-governmental organizations - a large space for non-requiremental organizations that criticize bad consequences.
Syrian Children in the Czech School - the story of integrated Syrians in CR.
Refuge not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Travelling of refugees - TT uses the expressions of a running or a fugitive and not a migrant.
Injury is primarily that CT in illustrative clusters uses in effect only for small children and women.
However, in the same sending, she said that 80% of the migrants held in Czech is in the same place.
Summary: The largest part of the propaganda that has no periods from communists.
I have to say I'm going to be like a former journalist after colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I was once in a panel apartment, soon I stopped to be the only inhabitant.
I've been moving the fish on the shop.
Fishing houses, a mix with a change not completed, i.e., which doesn't produce that tradition from a house to a bridge and the youth looks like an adult unit, just a small and gradually growing.
They were opponents to me, and I didn't want to destroy them.
First in hand and posting chemicals.
Socialist drugs on their liquidation offered some blue cristals.
I think that was Ciclon B.
Or otherwise?
However, it was successfully eliminated.
After I decided to do this with Pharaoh like that.
A box with a juvenalizer, which the morvenants brought into the nest, and then he did not allow the king to generate a new seed.
But I rejected it.
As time passed, the subject of my amazing was even a middle, and I've still been attached to the view that he has the same right to life as we people.
Moreover, I have taken the experience from my life that incoming into the eco doesn't lead to success and that one harm can replace one another.
The truth in the bullets and the shoes wouldn't be packed to worry about their karma killing.
In the new apartment, we agreed with the partner that if we have a fisherman's knife for our neck, they would eat calmly the bullets falling down, such as those invisible rows and similarly.
Their calm existence in time has cut down a powder.
It was a running species of a cowboy who had been sitting on the street.
We had it because he lived from sometimes men and comars, which just increased comfort.
Because we lived for a few years, we found that they lived primarily with fish and that their amount was obviously maintained in a lowly level.
Confidential regular contact at every need we have found that it's a single one.
We were witnesses of romantic conversations with a partner about some third of the less, as he carefully hangs on the bottles of bottles, so that it would not be burned before it reached an exhausted copulation.
It was about three days when they didn't move and did not respond to our controls.
Under the west mosque, where loving games were played, we found the rest of the dry socket.
Then the powder left for a long week.
When we thought it had been behind, we were surprised by a lot of small pigs, higher differentiation in her area.
They're gone soon.
They were burned by a mother, and they were divorced with others.
Even the cockpit disappeared somewhere after a week.
If she's gone to another or sleep, we don't know, but after a month, two, she's got up on the street again.
True, about something smaller, probably the daughter of that bathroom's householder.
For a while from the street, she carefully observed our behavior and movement under the West Mouse, evaluated our disappointment as a friendship.
The initial state of some designated fisheries re-decreased and the powder was quietly seen his running activities to ensure food.
The whole year our eco hasn't changed.
Our daughter, among them, was growing up to the night use.
We've been tolerating this, but we've already been interested in the exhaustion of his area.
We've still encouraged her to use the bathroom.
However, the daughter found an excuse in the cup that she saw very well when she was hit.
Our stories about the paveta seeing, the happiness of having a house hasn't been taken.
She was crying and weeping, and she was getting her nightmare.
It wasn't too much.
It was a moment when a pause had to go, in the interest of a daughter's development movement, to report.
It's left on me.
He was rejected into the glass and was stuck over the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I've been talking to him as a friend, but I felt like that after long suffering, as if I was getting out of my family.
We assumed that fishing would be more frequent and try to multiply with a geometric range.
The world's miracles, a week, two, no one found us there.
I started speculating about the reason.
I thought if the boy was there at the pattern of marriers, and he didn't investigate that the bathroom wasn't so favorable for their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of the middle size appeared, and they were rehearsed.
I had to figure out another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I came to see that their link to the pawka had to have a cause to see him hidden in any other place and that it would threaten them anywhere.
Or, they may have had such telepathy connections with their translator and his disappearance in them has caused an appealing reaction.
In addition, I'm not going to do any illusion about their air.
They showed a light of placesto, but that they would respond to holding hands or moves, not.
The daughter's going to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's already forgotten the night.
It's just gonna take a pause again.
I'm now sending my desire to the ether and I hope they didn't get on me after the execution.
Otherwise, they had to use the cyclon B.
A decade of Albert Einstein's announcements, which rejoiced in the world.
The genius of the past centuries, obviously, will never stop fascinating mankind.
In all, he was so deeply deceived that the result was a terrible discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important members of all the days.
In the news of people, he has first entered his special and general theory of relativeness, which is best described by the universe in his giant relationship.
It can also not be mentioned by its explanation of the photoeffect or the idea of the quantification of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the same description and the system of recognition of the relativeness theoretics are so important for many that they choose easily examples for closer notice of raâi.
But it's not easy.
Of course, Albert Einstein wouldn't have found a genially simplified form of explaining: a hour near your loved one seems to look like a minute; a minute in the heat peak seems a hour - and that's relative.
I allowed me to choose the ten who were literally captured from his whole praises of celebrated citizens.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, generally try not to do them.
Just two things are inconscient.
World and human foolishness.
I wasn't just like the first one.
No quantity of trials can never prove that I was right.
But the only one can ever prove that I was wrong.
But it's a mild period when it's easier to break atomy than to destroy the prejudices.
If an injury on the table is a reflection of an injury in a mind, what will then reflect the empty table?
I don't know who's going to fight in the Third World War, but in the fourth, they'll be locks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no one to resurrect it.
Knowing is a little dangerous and to do much too.
If I had an hour for the problem that my life would depend on, I'd have 40 minutes with his study, 15 minutes with his analysis and 5 minutes with his solution.
The most difficult thing in the world to understand the income tax.
Finally, I can't forgive Einstein's formula for the definition of success: If we take A for success, it applies the pattern: A=X+Y+Z where X is working, Y rest and Z to keep the language for teeth.
New to modern.
Hospitals in the Zline country expect changes to 1.5 billion.
"It's a success when we consider that all four are held in black numbers all this year," said a pleasant leader Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of national equipment is about 32 million crown at this point.
The share of this has primarily higher refunds than insurance, which are equally beneficial for the year.
It also shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally allow more investment.
In Kromardij, Vsetina, Uher Hradišti and Zlini, the constructions which will be at least 1.5 billion crowns.
The long time we purchased the main devices ended.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them the medical health is not done, he has made the plans of the national health design for Lubomir Netime.
It's glad for changes in all sicknesses.
The builders will come to the hospital for the next year.
In the Universe, they now choose the suppliers of a new internal pavilion for 300 million crowns.
In Crossmarage, there is a planned dialysis.
Uherian Gradișa wants to build a new internal for about 200 million to the year opened to the central pavilion.
And the Zlin Bati's hospital is waiting for a new central income and internal building, which will need three fourth billion billion.
In all cases, it is essential and often the biggest changes in the past years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors it's an extremely important step," she declared for example to build a healthy internal director of the Faith Prousk hospital.
Five pattern buildings must be ready for about two years and offer comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, bed and an intensity unit.
More comfort for patients.
Changes that are particularly known by patients will be affected by all regions.
The new buildings, for example, are replaced by those in which many sick in one room, looking at only one toilet, beds are incapable, unfortunate windows, and health careers do not have corresponding exchanges for work.
"For example, our internal was set up for fifty years ago and now it is at the border of its life," said the director of the criminal disease Paul Calábek.
Therefore, for several years, it will be replaced by the seven-under-sized modern buildings associated with urgent receipt.
The doctors and patients will have all acute divisions on one place, and also in new rooms.
The same model already has the half of the Uher's Hardware.
The central income is already standing and will come to him within three years.
"We'll pay the station from the credit and part of their own guards," explained Director Peter Sladek.
Just this hospital can allow its own financing as the only in the country.
The win has still been the highest and has not been lost two years ago when the illness of the hospital was likely to have lost a 2 billion.
"We have good relationships with assurances, excellent performance, income and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimik Vajdak, who has an anxiety economic.
Improvements are also expected by chronic disease patients.
During ten to 15 years, new devices and reconstruction will go to half billion crowns.
This year will be prepared for a mysterious station, then the dialysis supplies, where appropriate, building a building for a new magnetic resistance.

No one explained to me how I should keep the springs accepted in the country if they don't want to live in Czech.
The Minister Milan Chovanec (CSSD) after negotiating with its European colleagues, presses the remaining States of Czech to accept the quota for the re-distribution of flights, but they refuse any debate.
He also points out that no one has explained to him how to maintain the assigned flights in Czech if they do not want to live with us.
"We haven't received the answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec said to the journalists.
Can you describe the position you have come to the Deputy Ministers' negotiations inside and invoke the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that can't work.
We can't talk about the scarlets of salt or mouth.
They are living living creatures who have a vision, whose views are somewhere, whose family are.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we could maintain the Member States' territory if they had re-distributed them.
We can't imagine that.
We didn't get the answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With the final conclusions - the dangers of registration, the protection of borders, the camps outside Europe, the confidential Fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with it.
We've been talking about this for a year and we've said this is the way.
But to say that the quotas will solve everything?
We've recently resolved forty thousand, now it's a hundred twenty thousand.
When is it five hundred thousand?
And how will those people keep on the territory?
Ninety-eight percent of people who cross through us want to go to Germany.
No one wants us to, we just don't know how to keep them here.
We have an ambitious ambition to walk with other strangers, Ukraines, Vietnamites and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country, but whose interest in people from this village, therefore from Syria and other countries, is limitedly near zero.
You mentioned that the flighters don't want us, but 15 hundred people we've already committed to accept.
Wouldn't it be possible for them to take this way more?
We were committed to accept 1500 people, but with a submin.
We said, City hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even in the 1500s, there will be 1100 people with whom we will arrange the asylum procedure.
They're coming to our teenager, and we'll be at the same time as those we've arrested.
It is a big question, and we will discuss this with Europe if we can keep people registered in Italy and Greece, where appropriate, in Hungary.
Because Europe is taking into account that if it has a register, they cannot be arrested.
This means that they will come to our registering territory, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, we can not even hold those 1100 in the Czech Republic and they will go back to Germany after they arrive.
We will be able to keep them after the time of the asylum management, we will arrange the asylum procedure with them.
If these are the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, then 98 percent will be obtained by the international protection of Europe.
Then they will get evidence that will allow them to travel to Europe.
And I think these people will end again in the target countries.
Then there's four hundred people who're going to move.
This is the second project that is still being divorced, and there we have just continued to discuss with churches about the possibility that they could help them get employment, accommodation and so further.
But it's a run on a lot of trace.
You said that the final states were not willing to discuss the negotiations of the Ministers with us.
But isn't it that the Czech Republic only refuses the quotas, but doesn't it propose a solidarity step that would block the debate?
And what exactly must be a solidarity step?
The Federal Republic of Germany will urge all Syrians to be able to them, so that the report is spread in a number of hours after all camps after Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's going to be a further spectacular whale that's going to Germany because they just don't want us.
We believe that the road is the protection of the external borders - just to deal with the ornamental waves, to help the needs, and to separate the economics.
I mean to show them that they don't have any chances.
Only in Germany in the long year, fifty thousand Kosovo were arrived.
From the secure Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including police, courts, state representatives.
If we could separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the economic needs, the 50 percent of what social systems are currently missing could go to flights.
In contrast to the first day when Germany carried out controls, the amount of the detained in Czech.
Now it's eighteen, first day it was twelve.
How long is it going to do so that the controls of the woods are still insufficient?
We've been afraid of mystery in a number of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we're controlling.
We still have a few hundred free places in stone detention equipment.
Of course, all the people we're holding will return to Russia within seven days.
We're doing it standardly.
They're the only ones who take us, with Hungary it's complicated, and the Greeks -- it's a completely inexcusable story.
So where's the point of the destruction?
Should it be a thousands daily?
I think it should be a few hundred days ago.
Two hundred, three hundred people daily, three days after them, we have the capacity so much that the crises plans will be overcome.
Then I agreed with Mr. Prime Minister that he would call an extra-government immediately.
He's very interested in everything, we're in telephone contact sometimes daily.
If this is happening, the government may put the de facto immediately, and by one resolution, he would decide to strengthen the police on the armies, let's take the customs administration, where appropriate, for the periodic service.
Is the country warrant a exceptional status that now has been reported in some places in Hungary?
I think that can't come to us so far.
Make sure that our position is different, we are a national state in Europe, we have only a Schengen border and only airport.
I don't know what to happen to this happen in the Czech Republic, I don't want to broadcast a wide information.
All the information we have from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary are more evident that Hungarians are trying to remove the course to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean direct road to Russia.
The Czech Republic would have touched it very increasingly, at all.
Slavia paid a lot of debts for the last minute.
He's trying to prevent the statement of an accident.
Football Slavia paid the debts.
The Ballists also expected their money.
Fotbal Slavia first placed on Wednesday on the basis of the inconvenient proceedings before the court.
Three months after that, about 20 million crowns gave us online services from the Pacific Samoa.
For a few hours, Representative Slavie Zuzana Youth attempted Judge Michael Wenzlov to convince that she had no injury over Slovenia.
And you need to say that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that a large Chinese industrial and investment group of CEFC and also the CEFC billion Jiří Shimana has become a previous week with the new owner of Slovenia.
Obviously, from the new owners to the club, money arrived, and that's the last time.
This also demonstrates the statement of Slovenia before the Tuesday Court of Justice - the Tourist Club on Monday, only the day before the court's negotiation, sent debt tens of millions of coroners.
"All was disappointed between 11 September and 15 September," stated Legal Representative Slavie Mladk.
Who did Slavia pay for?
Current and former players and business partners.
In particular, for example, the Slovenian Exrepre, Milan Ivano, or the Czech booker Mariu Lick.
Slavia also charged agent Alexander Losenicke.
On Wednesday, the club also paid the debt of the city part of Praha 10.
The part of the in­national dispute remains so de facto only the views that Slavia is dispatching.
Anything according to the club of the committee has not been dismissed, or the courts are conducted.
However, we are ready to pay the amounts in case of loss of these conflicts.
"We have the needs in the banking, which we can add to the exemplay," the Judge of the Lawyer of Youth told.
"All that was after freedom is disappointed," said the Youth and added that they are only invalid or distorted commitments.
Of course, in the nearest days the judge will not decide and the procedure will continue.
She gave Slovenia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she paid the debts.
It will come to an evaluation of all evidence.
The decision may therefore be expected first in November.
The Court ordered the proceedings to continue on November third.
However, the decision will not take place this meeting, but it will be written after it.

Blanka was building so that she didn't make it.
But it would be about half a billion more, says a professional from a company that designed a tunnel.
Blanka was more safer, says the expert.
The Tunnel Complication Blanka was possible to build so that there were no two falls of the land in the Prague Stromovic, the producer manager of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovič.
He said it in the middle of the afternoon at the newspaper of the tunnel.
But it would be about half a billion crown dearer.
The drivers will be opened on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"Tunnel was going to grow safer, but the costs grow exponencyally," said Butovich.
The submissions in the Stromvec were the same for all the time, but the country had only fallen a few steps from the place where it began to grow safer and more careful.
"If the measures were used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half billion more precious," said Butovič.
Tunel Blanka fell three times during the building.
Twice, in 2008, the land fell in Stromovce, in 2010, at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of the company Metrostav Jiří Belohlava, the tunnel is very dear, said the Euro week.
The station had a 17 billion coron, according to the p-intention.
And when we calculate the DPH that went two times in the building, you have 11 billion.
When you added to it, the sales of lands and the engineering activity, the value and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is no longer from those 37 to so far, he introduced the Whitehead.
It's as if someone's doing it and paying it.

FedExu mixed Zisky, decreased fiscal view for 2016
FedEx has reported unsatisfactory results for the last fourth and great reduction of the prejudice of the annual profit for the lower cost and higher costs for the earthquarters.
The company also stated that it planned to have approximately 55,000 seasonal works.
The FedEx announced that it would take 50 000 seasonal work on the vacation.
The company's shares were decreased by approximately 2,5 per cent in the pre-trade 45 minutes before the average opening.
FedEx states that it expects a deal between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends the next flower, which means a decrease of 20 cents of the previous predict.
Analysers expected $10.84, according to the investigation of FactSet.
The decreased view comes, despite the increase in rates in the average of 4.9 per cent, which is shown in January. 4, and higher payments for land transport of hard or big packages starting in November.
The company noted that it continued to expect the growth of profit from the previous year from the reduction of costs, the higher income and the growth in online trade.
President of the representative and Director-General of the company Fred ́th said that "the company had granted a strong performance despite the expected economic submissions, particularly in the processing industry and global trade."
The purchase plans were notified on the day after the UPS Rival company stated that it was planned to have at least 90.000 to 95.000 workers, which is likely the last year.
In the quarter that ended in August 31, FedEx received $692 million, which is more than 6 percent than last year.
Request for action made $2.42, which is less than $2.44 for a share, which was predicted by 12 analyses questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
The markets increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analytics of Zacks' companies expected $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been intended to reduce the priority of the international ship transport in the past years, which caused the income in its Express Unit to be decreased.
But boom online purchasing strengthened the results of the FedEx Earth unit.
In the last fourth quarter, the earthly income increased by 29 per cent, but the operational profit was basically the same due to higher prices than the package and its own insurance.
The Expert Unit mentioned a higher income due to higher basic rates, while the winning was decreased in the cost trade due to higher prices for work.
In the preliminary trade about a hour before opening, FedEx shared $3.85, or $150.15.
On Wednesday, 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent under record from 11 June.
At their unexpected meeting for the whole year, the federal reserve legislators will take this week two days of sitting at 27 feet long Hundorian mahagon table and will decide whether the time has come to increase the key rates in nearly ten years.
On one end of the central bank's ornament, the two-party meeting room will be a premium of the United States.
The map is the fact that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues give economic interests to the people above all.
The Central Bank has two acquisitions from Congress: maximising the US employment and maintaining the currently stability prices.
But from the Great Reception, the representatives of the Fedu believed that there was an unwritten third period: financial stability.
And this third employment period could be a X factor in too close to the predictable decision to be reported on Thursday, whether the American economy is ready to start with an unprecedented stimulus in comparison with the short rates at the end of 2008.
Although data shows a solid economic growth, recent turbulence on the world financial markets could already be feared by the Fed to add to inconsistency by increaseing its reference rate of federal funds - even more than a quarter of the percentage point.
"It is obvious that the work market and inflation will be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economic of the Stefel Nicolaus & Co firm.
"But I think they were just looking for an increasing incidence of peace, an increased incidence in the global market already provides them enough delay to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what Fed will do, which is the cause of nervousness on the financial markets.
Approximately half of the economys recently questioned by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate of this week.
However, the financial markets expect Fed to maintain the matter, with the key indicator only about 30% chances for increase.
This would indicate the decrease of the action market in the case of Fed's increased rates only if the political would fall by the promise that the further increase was incompatible.
On Wednesday, the industrial prospectus of Dow Jones sprang by 228,89 points, or 1.4%, on 16 599.85.
The consequence was launched by the expectation that the Fed politics will keep the rates in silence this week, says John Lonski, the main economy in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed were now taking the taxes," he said.
Fed politicians would do that, "they must go to nationality in their program declaration and keep the financial markets in hands so that they don't panic."
Other experts claimed that increasing rates would reduce the financial markets because it would remove the incertainty of how the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be on a good road to increase the rate of 0.25 percent point this month, the first small step in the slow decline of monetary submissions that would confirm the strength of economic relief in the United States.
Yellen said that over the yar and the beginning of the year, it expects an increase in rates in the year and the complaints from the liberals that it needs more economic progress.
Although the creation of workplaces in August was slow, the work market this year has made a solid growth.
The unemployment measure increased to 5.1% in the previous month, which is less than seven years and is near the level that Fed considers full employment.
The salaries showed signs of highlighting.
And even though inflation continues to run under an annual 2% of the central bank's objective, the Fed policy claims that the main debt was a temporary degree of the growth prices very lower.
"The economy can be equipped with higher rates and it is, in view of the importance of the work market," said Ian Shepherdson, the main economy of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets worldwide began to dismiss the end of the past month after China devaluated its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones decreased up to 16% under its record value in May when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would decrease global growth.
The market was sometimes declined in this month and Dow now lost only 10% of the max.
For the political factors of the Fedu, inevitably on the market adds a complex calculation when starting to increase the rates.
"When the facts have happened on the financial markets and the reports on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, it would have occurred in this meeting," said Stephen D. Olglie, leading researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now it predicts that they are waiting for at least a month to get better control of the results.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about how this will affect the United States economy, and there are no data to be discussed about the latest development in China," said Ol.
The health status of global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technology should not be included in their decision.
But at the end of the Fed, the Monetary Authority of the world became.
The impact of the central bank in recent years was enormous.
The summary sign of the president of Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "usure" their monetary expansion on the market, let the crowds run throughout the world.
In the world where markets and economics are still closely connected, the representatives of the Feder can expect to follow the development elsewhere, but they also advise the final central bankers and experts to better read the state of global economy.
Their decision process is "more art than," said Zachary Karabell, the leader of the global strategy for the wealth-management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "Fed has stories of movements on financial markets that seem independent to economic bases."
Lacker, voting member of the establishment of the Federal Market Policy Committee, which pressed to increase the rates, cited decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led Fed to reduce its reference rates by 0.75 percent point during the three meetings "I through the identifiable impacts on growth in the United States," Lacker said.
For a year later, the representatives of the Fed have turned these shirts.
Fed should prejudice the concerns of financial stability only during the large crisis, such as the market deterioration in 2008, said Adam Posen S., former member of the Bank of England Tax Committee.
The newest heat doesn't even approach this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in fear of growing taxes because the markets were spread," Posen said, the President of the Institute for the International Economy Peterson .
The Federal Reserve System Law has two more mandates and doesn't mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they're supposed to get on a shot.

The speed on the streets remains at the old.
From 150 km/h Snémovna refused.
At the selected range of distances it may be possible to increase the maximum authorised rate to 150 km/h by profitable submins.
On Wednesday, Snamvna decided when she approached the amendment of the Senate, who refused to increase the capacity.
The new legislation on earth communications will now go to the president.
President Milosh Zeman said at the end of April that the law allowing steps of miles of miles would be a veterating.
In contrast to increase, the Ministry of Transport Dan ́ok (for the United Nations), which, according to the Czech tax network, has not yet been established for such a situation.
On Wednesday before the deputy, he supported the senate version of the law.
The approved news will now be allowed in accordance with the governmental statement to increase from 90 to 110 km a hour at the first class's roads, especially the four-country roads.
The Snippet first extended this option to the distances to which it could be driven in the selected ranges of up to 150 km/h, but Senat refused it.
The messengers now approached him.
The Senators, with the agreement of the Minister for Transport from News, also issued the authorisation of the transport police to have the last word in adjusting local communications to which the foreigners are concerned.
The Senate version approved by Snemovna also calculates that the channels, waters or cabs of public lighting could be stored subsequently under the surface of the vehicle.
Foreigners would have so protected for the redemption of lands.
Foreigners should also not have the obligation to take care of the road plants to divide local roads without prejudice to the owner of the appropriate ground.
Novela also needs to help improve the protection of the road and facilitate the combined loading of vehicles to which the owners do not register.
The new foreigns may sell vehicles that are not authorised within the six months after the notification of their owner's retirement.
Foreigners will have the opportunity to eliminate transit cost transport through their territory on the roads of other and third classes under threat of repentance and for sending companies.
The news will also disable the possibility of introducing electronic remote marks instead of accessible papers that will be used in this way after 1 January of the next year.
According to the government, it's too much money for the introduction of the electronic system.
The earlier exposure goes before the court.
He's threatened for a prejudiced welcome for 10 years.
The case is related to the particularly predicted project Welcome to Strands.
The police wanted to blame the lawyer Zuzana Kaila (CSSD), but it wasn't the missionary.
According to the legal case, both are threatened to ten years of negotiation.
The vote of calculation is still planned for two October days.
According to the State Representative Mandik and Macike, at least one million crowns caused damage from claims.
The complainant's based on a discovery.
The former members of the city's leader, according to the complainant's title, have unlawfully allowed the company to gain property benefits that organized the welcome of the branches.
The mandate, according to the complaint of the Director of the City Services, School and Cultural Committee, has set up to celebrate the election management of five fires connected.
When another company that offered the lowest price was registered in the competition, the concurrence was cancelled.
The order was then to be confidential to the administrator and only Darothor's company, which then has assigned the town's advice.
The city paid at least a million more.
Both complaints were made to ensure that Darothore was assigned a public prohibition to organise the Action Welcome to the Labetime of Labea and co-ordinated acted at least in contrast with the request for the prosecution of the prosecutor's care, writes the State representative.
At the same time, they believed that Darothore, after the receipt of this prohibition, calculates the Court of Labem for the implementation of the Action Welcome to the Price, which will exceed the real value of the services offered indirectly.
In three years, the company incased more than five million crowns, according to the project record.
The city finally paid only one part, approximately 1.7 million crowns, and then departed from s'you.
The payment amount was, according to the identified estimate, at least a million crowns prejudiced.
The mandy has rejected any violation of the law before.
I haven't done any criminal action, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this designed case, he said a former primator before, that the city under its lead was just linked to a project of the past years.
The event was guaranteed by the Roxy II Agency in 2008 to 2010.
"It was for the same submin, for the same money," added Mandik.
The criminals also wanted to accuse the ladies of Kaila, who was also a member of the city's Council.
She wasn't going to run.
That's why the criminals have rejected the cup in her case, but they are counting that Kayle's accusation after he's finished the missionary mandate.
Welcome to the branches was a Community action that had been done sometimes in the year.
Mothers received a present check of five thousand crowns for the purchase of children’s needs and small gifts.
The Hungarian cops have probably let the dog's fucking.
Then the journalists had to delete the record.
The Hungarian police at the border with Serbia quickly arrested the cameraman of the AP agency and made him remove the record that the police dog probably hit the land of the flight.
The Hungarian government, but this accusation is a doubt.
The evident incident became on Saturday evening when the AP AP Luca Musi filmed those who passed over the sugar field near the Hungarian town of Röschka over the border with Serbia.
In contrast with the flights, the cops went out, and one of them left the true Syrian to attack a dog with a cockpit on a cow.
The dog who cried, "Please, I'm a flighter," he cried, he insisted on the Museum.
The Museum's filming everything, he noticed one of the cops and didn't let him go.
But the journalist had no more to phone his superposed or his colleagues in the place.
The Musician police took him to the dark place at the registration centre of flights and asked him to show them what he's acquired.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
This is how Museum came to the outcome of two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because he was close to dogs.
The AP Agency sent a protesting letter to the Hungarian speaker of Zoltán Kovács.
The behavior of the police signed that it was unacceptable and stated that journalists should have the opportunity to cover events without risking physical violence and not to be afraid that the government would destroy the legally obtained material.
Kwocs with the call to the police report of the Music counterfeit.
He said that the police just wanted to show them the journalist if they were on some cases, which they think they had the right.
When they found that they weren't there, they didn't hurt him.
"The dogs can shoot -- they're practiced to disturb and a little fear, but they're certainly not attacked," Kovács said.
Unpredictable League of Masters.
The town's whistling will shoot us, Juventus.
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we've been deserving to lose," he broke the head of Manuel Pellegrini, the householder City.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic ship of the Master Liges.
One team didn't create a lot of opportunity, but we had a bottle on the cottons longer.
"The cause of the damage was not in a tactic, Juventus just shot two beautiful ≥," he assessed Pellegrini, whose team was incased in competition after 636 minutes.
This finalist of the past season of Juventus was on it before the mutual concentration exactly opaquely - after the first three rounds of the Italian liga has the covering of the title only point and score 2:4 is located on the 16th place of the table.
That's why it was a big surprise to Etihad Stadium.
"This winning of psychic helps us, he'll shoot us," means the coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to arrange with a lost three opponents before the new yearbook - Pirla, Teveze and Vidala.
In Manchester, they represented the Pogba, Mandjukich and Morata.
"It's true, this victory is very important, maybe we'll find it on a victory whale," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're working among the best men in Europe.
In the second half of the time, we were better, mainly in an attack phase.
This output is worth my players.
"Before our compensation, we could incase at 0:2, but Gianluigi kept us," appreciated the cup of Allegri, M. Buffon.
"We have made a few good chances," hated Yay Tourego, bookmarker City.
We have to get out of the Liga Experience Masters and try a better outcome next.
Bye, Angelo, bye old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issues of immigrants, we should have realized that the whole medical disturbance is managed by professionals.
According to the needs of media and also the season.
So let's stop on the ch's.
Today, newspapers and media are full of kids that carry their parents on their hands on the dust of exode.
And it calls in a person -- so in a European person -- automatically feeling guilty and competition.
Well, they're not coming here only too lonely kids, note the clusters of the chickens attached to the Greek Islands that the child's not so much to see them!
Well, the last time, we missed from the television images of ships on Lampedus, refugees from the French menton, where thousands of young men are beautiful.
A lot of young black.
They also disappeared images from Callais, where these foods and black men are waiting for them to be made by the tunnel under La Manche.
I guess she's not thinking it anymore.
Not even those images of the primitive Christian Church of Eritrea have made a special idea to the people of Europe.
That was too bad.
So when it's about the quota for refugees, it's also hidden that it's not just about a funny kid from Syria, but also about an exhibited - for elders: nicely disappointed - young men.
Their muscles look like they just get out of a fit center.
That's only one personal effect.
This year, in Turkey - Muslim - part of Cyprus, we lied on a private hotel beach.
Notwithstanding that she was private, a large group of cars came to the beach suddenly.
But no dogs.
And the young black ones came out of them.
That's about 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They entered the beach, all clothes in the brands and bottles, in their hands, as otherwise, smartphonys.
That it's about a private beach, it's not interested, and the employees - Turkey, Muslims! - they were obviously afraid.
They had all the beds.
Who wasn't lying on him and was just in the sea, he had comfort.
They were dressed like the American rapper movie.
On the head of a bottle with neck, white and color adises on the feet.
Then they broke the local beach bar and started running.
They set the tables around, dressed near the eating and white gates of the bar -- reading the Muslims and the Europeans without asking.
The mothers with the kids shot out of the eating terrace somewhere in calm.
The coming black people drinked a beer just from the third - as in the US series? - on the beach they had a blank beach around them.
They continued to vote one to another.
But it wasn't the case.
Then they went into a drink of wine, even from a lake.
They shot into the hotel basement - in the brands, especially the young ladies -, in the water of shoes and rivers, mothers with kids and children were scared and no longer on the beach or in the basket.
They're all lost.
Notwithstanding whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel employees were afraid to talk about them.
The teacher said, "Have you seen the gold that they had?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they didn't have it out of the work," said the lawyer.
I remembered, "I know, all of them had around their legs of gold.
And one had about twenty metres of gold cross on his leg.
And women were like goldenness.
"They're drugs?" I asked me.
"You have seen how they cry," answered the lawyer.
The drogs don't care, they don't live.
They're drinking something fully different.
So I've been aware of what they've painted.
Of course, in June 2105 it wasn't so important for me.
I didn't know what he would follow.
But secret services and top policies had to do this first.
I don't think they wouldn't know.
At that time, about 1.5 million immigrants were issued to Europe.
And he went and went and went.
Today, the main issue of the European Union is that total-political-corrective policies, such as intellectual and related lobbyist and economic-economic groups, are the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and his politicians - the publicly recognised main force in Europe today - lies, lies and lies - but not only they, as well as the EU and televisions, including ours.
For example, recent television pictures of the highly welcomed refugees in Germany are at the level of Moscow TV videos from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sunsets, but mainly - old prisoners - the Muslims welcomed their companions.
During a long week, the reports on the Czech television have been blabbled, as the Germans have said, are almost all for the arrival of the emigrants.
Of course, who was only a few days in Germany, knows that it's a lie.
This confirms further information.
For example, a glorious research of public opinion organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Society of the Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take more flights for a week ago.
That's what our televisions also missed.
However, they hid the second day in Germany: in the review of the article, 94.5 percent of Germans did not want any immigrants - the investigations were 67.000.
It is true that the officer of Merkel publicly in November 2010, so five years ago, declared: "Our efforts on `multi-culti `communication has completely failed."
Then she said, "Germany delivers a fight for a multicultural company."
"All efforts on such suffering were completely wrong."
In the country where four million Muslims live, it states that the strategy that allowed people from different cultures to live with themselves, without being integrated, today lives with us and we claimed that they would not remain once again.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say we're just living happily with ourselves, this access failed.
It's completely failing.
However, not Merkel has the power to walk against the powerful German and Europe and mainly against political correction.
It shows the scaling of the wind.
The conflict increases.
Euronemec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, lawyer for the SPD, the only one who has no maturity in the European Parliament - yes, this is the one about which Berlusconi in the European Parliament said that he could play a supervisor in a concentration for a minute, as he had already previously.
It seems, especially under the opinion of the recent German policy issues, that Germany has exceeded Rubikon.
Let us note that, in some cases, the majority of European policies does not support these announcements, the states of countries who were victims of nacism are scared.
What happened to Germany?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
What years have they tried, at least a breakfast, to arrange with their horrible past of an aggressor and a murderer of millions?
Are those who say that in the soul of Germany there is a set of the devils of aggressiveness, superstition and violence?
Did officer Otto von Bismarck have been right when he stopped the temptations of the Great Ones to control the whole centre of Europe?
When did he say the Great German idea will destroy Germany?
I guess he had.
When they left her, she started preparation for the First World War.
The idea of the Great Germany, which led Germany and Europe to two wars, which were a million of lives, probably returned in another way.
After the Marxists tried to control the state, such as the Rote Armee Group, and after the failure of NDR, in Germany, the ecology, which was, for example, one of the main ideas of nacism, began to develop a new German ideaology.
They said the sun.
German elitis were prohibited by German nationalism, and thus left all those fights against the atom, the surroundings seeking for all, the silence supported the old Empire and Nazi password Our woods must live.
In order to satisfy unconfortable young people who want to do something different and better worldwide, they are fully attached to the fight against the heat of the planet, stop nuclear electricity, etc.
And they forgot that in this run there is also a strong anti-semitic, so-called propalestinian and antislovanic pump that considers all Slovenia as a verb since Karla Marxe, who, after the Jews' parents, was primarily a German nationalist.
And also, as shown by the latest terms of School and of German minors that are threatened to the disobeyed east States, the idea of German leadership.
You need to listen without a reply.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when we admire that immigrants are a very influent group of electors, we have what we have.
And thereby it stands as a person, especially the German, who is speaking, and who is the one who is being controlled by Germany in fact through the bank and the Union.
The pseudo-fire of solars first brought Germany into the ecological and multicultural areas and brought them home today and could still bring millions of Muslims.
Who, thrown up the voices of sirene, will quickly come to the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they're going to hurt.
Germany can only threaten his neighbors with strength, and again part of his people -- but it seems to be still smaller -- ideologically disturbing, but finally the reality of it as it is achieved.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslims are already burning.
What will the German government do when the public protests of Germans against the islamists' income will be exhausted?
The Muslims who are already in Germany will come to help, but are they determined not to be assimiled to take placed habits and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalization, islamists and Germans will be released in themselves, following the fear of islamizing their country?
What will this do to Germany, and at all to Germany, when people who will vote and protest publicly against the new euro-human Muslim?
Germany simply changed.
The conflict that in Europe has led to the support of solar ideology, thus the elitarian and principle of totality, and its unsettled banks, grow.
And because of the unlikely dealing with the democracy Germans and all the subordinated and individual neighbors of the East, this cannot be a good effect.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get out of the swimming sellers: to scare them to death.
It's enough to blow up and the strong bottles on you in a way that the weakest thoughts don't just need to fall down.
The living head will nicely cut you up and swiftly, to the road it will lead (or more swiftly) an invisible sale and a living socket.
Maybe the damage that speaking clothes can't be arranged too in the ability.
We'd like to have a lot of shoes and smides.
Round number (Oxalis corniculata).
A little powder that's tolerating sucking.
And that's how it's between the foreign walls near my dwelling.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which even belongs to expansive poultry, but it makes a good idea about flowing.
There's a middle of the foreign walls.
She's inexcusable, she's getting in our garden.
He's more dry, it's easily adaptable, modesty, and inheritable.
Although it creates a chaotic composition papers, it is therefore worth watching it and keeping on.
Under a small view, there is just a beautiful detail - yellow flowers and green sheets with fibres.
Brazilian pediat company Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet at the feeding
The Brazilian pediat company SPRS has come with a shocking way to try to make women know about the importance of good food by using the images of children who are from the breast painted by showing unhealthy food.
Human maternal milk consists of different proteins, tubes, vitamins and carbohydrates that adds to those of all animals that are used to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the excess of energy requirements, pregnant women and new-coated mothers are recommended to increase the daily calories income by 500 calories daily.
However, new investigations indicate that the increased income of calories is not the only diet measures to be carried out by the mother.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnancy women have affected the genetic creation of their children and have protected them from the development of age.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets had a negative impact on the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates taxes, although Nine's trying to take lead in Today Show
By Karl Stefano and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry's commission to cover costs for the results of liberal leading, it was unable to create a sufficient increase in assessment for Today.
The early show of Nine was released from the national after Malcolm Turnbulla Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with the host David Koche and Samanthou Armytage seated in London as a part of a week of a long series of international television, including Dubai, New York, Niagaries and Cancun.
It didn't seem to be too important at this tiranee of Aussie TV distants because it mentioned 397 000 wheels in five main cities compared to 330 000 Wheels of Today's sending.
Today it was a smaller increase in its evaluation compared to Monday (317 000) and last Wednesday (283,000), but their number was until the last quarter (343,000).
Today, he's filling the sea on Sunris in the past months.
In August, there were 318 000 in Today, compared to 330 000 in Sunris.
At the beginning of the year, the scale moved between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has 349 000 birds and Today 314 000.
That's the most interesting thing that's been done.
Wind changes affect more than Parliament today, friends!
Karl and Lisa are good. Thank you for the deal.

A big report for Seven was an incredible debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama of a recently admired father, who will decide to move with his two children to the Mediterranean Sea of New Zealand, has a very active 1,219 million dishes.
The critics thought that Thomson himself could be able to run TV hit without the star Rafters Rebeccy Gibney.
The outcome of yesterday evening gives "yes".
The X Factor from Seven left the strong 1,136 million wilds, with which the cold struck The Block (838.000) and TBL families (726.000)
Seven mentioned mixed follow-up last night the Chase.
The half of the new television kitchen (from 17:00 to 17:30), which Andrew O'Keefe mentioned, had about 446.000 kidneys.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) sprang up to 623.000 birds — which was enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half of the Chase had about 520 000 birds and the second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat had 620 000 in average.
Thanks to the decrease of the evaluation of the Chase of the second night, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will finally win at 17:30.
The Chase is replaced by a Million Dollar Minute that couldn't hurt McGuira's show.

Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is a perfect boy - but who's going to choose?
Secret discovered?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have discovered unwantedly who wins Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes to Bachelor, has been caught by an incredible secret.
And the three girls who are staying will certainly not forsake who is the right one that will finally get.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezani Markoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows day before they left only two, they ungratefully told us who wins.
Sam Wood holds the tongue for teeth in the quarter final
All three women were sing about why Wood was a perfect man, sensing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive values, and the reason why they wanted to be his partner.
Everyone at the question, "When it wouldn't, what would get Woodo's final flower?", could their answers work as a spoiler about who would get the heart of Bachelor.
Like Jeavons-Fellows, so Markoskie named Mackay as the one who would best go to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared a light relationship from the eighth day.
"From the time I entered home and observed the energy of Sarah and Sama, I felt that they were pretty compatibil and I still think that through the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really a landing woman, she's very pleasant with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemical among them.
It's good and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks they could make the first couple with Sam Wood.
For herself, she claims that during his last visits she realized that Wood could be "the true."
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this isn't just a game -- I've cut him up now my whole heart," she adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if he didn't eat, she was mysteriously faced.
"I don't know if I can say it," she said.
I have both girls the same thing -- it's uncertainly between Snow and Lana.
Bachalor is sent to the middle of 7.30 to Den.
Is Sarah's best choice published for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had a few options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his movement to the United States and many teams asked after his great start of the train at the end of the past year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsul and seems to be a reasonable decision.
Some trainers left Hayne sitting after the rest of their own, because he made a mistake that made the conversions of Australian rugby ligue during the first extract from the forest at Tuesday exhaust 20:3 to Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed his confidence in the player and gave him another chance to return and put him in the game after Reggie Bushe's hurt.
Tomsula was also still honest in the shot after the game.
Instead of burning the new boys before the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly on prints after the storage.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, announced that Hayne also received an encouragement from the special team coordinator, Thomas McGhey, who advised him to forget a mistake and care only about the next game.
During the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne, he made his mistake.
It was certainly not the start where Hayne and his mass hoped in his NFL debut.
Hayne was arrested when he was unable to get out of the field and then told the Australian Radio Due Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 worse start of the NFL career, he couldn't even imagine.
"It's happening, you just focus on the next game and it's all," said Hayne
Hayne compared the trap to his debt in 2007 when the recording in its own territory led to Queensland three.
It was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne published photos with fans on which he holds the Australian flag on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russ Vladimir Putin are in the debate on homosexual rights
In 2003, the richest Russian man Mikhail Khodorkovski was arrested in the Syrian ranway guns.
Following an intermediate doubt of President Vladimir Putina, Khodorkovski was condemned, his chairman Yukos was confiscated and his democracy efforts were obscured.
The USS became immigrants who helped the replacement of the property.
Two emigrated in 1984, and their inability obtained a new owner.
After 1989, the property could not be returned, therefore the two returned to the state with the request of a refund under the law on mimosudy rehabilitations.
The Court first assigned them the requested amount, thus over 2.8 million crowns, but the Court of Auditors changed their sentence by granting them only 90 thousand crowns with a reference to the extent that the refund was determined in accordance with the 1991 price rules.
The Emigrants became the Supreme Court and added to them a deeply claimed amount.
The Ministry of Finance to pay the money, but returned to the USS.
In the meantime, such a change in social and economic conditions has occurred that the refund granted by the valid legislation - then the replacement is appropriate in relation to the insolvency - is now only a fractional value of the insolvency.
"This cannot go to the height of the counterparts in the refund of authorised persons who have been in the rights of at least since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity for homes to refund before," reporter Jaroslav Fenyk explained why the U.S. was on the side of the emigrants.
"US repeatedly stated that general courts should act in refund matters so that the caseless ineficiencies are not placed in the failures of legal persons and to achieve the refund legislation, thus the opening of the injury caused by the acts of the former totality state," added the judge.
Evito in musical dictionary DVA now is the Fishar creation Council.
Rada Fishara became the worldwide youngest Evita, when in 1998 she made the role of the wife of the argentin dictator Evu Perón in the first Czech reporting of this famous musical Andrewa Lloyd Weber and Timea Ricea in the Prague district of Spiral.
To return to the same role, he says, "Today, Evita's prosecution has not been equipped."
Evita, however, is not only the role of the responsibility, but also the responsibility.
In the role of the first lady of Argentina, Monica Absolon recommended her.
I saw the monk three times in Evita, and it was absolutely inspiring for me.
I've seen a completely new idea here once.
I'm increasingly an advantage of moderate adjustments, but this is just a particular point.
"Regie Andrée Sokola is original, distracted and current," said Fischar.
A significant transmission of the musical truck between the two songs will take place on the Concert of Birthday of the Monkey of Absolon 27 September since 19 hours in the divadle DVA.
He's getting tracks out of Evita musical tonight.
It will certainly belong to the common duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Stop your weeping, Argentina!).
In a limited number of representations, Andrew Sokol will also sprung from the Registry board when he will attend after carl Roden's film in the role of President Perón.
For the purposes of the public's interest, further terms were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech World Music Study Evita indicates the divadlo DVA in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.

4 people kill after the police shot the guim projects on demonstrants in Neèlu
Four people, including the four-year-old boy, were killed in South Nepal after the police shot the gum projects to the deal of demonstrators against us in the new State establishment, the officer introduced in the middle of the police.
The violence occurred on Wednesday evening on Thursday Rupandehi, about 175 miles west from Kathmand's main city.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the leader of the periodic expert, states that more than 1000 demonstrators were stored before the police station, and some dropped stones and burning bombs.
Mr. Dhakal states that the police used the weapons gas and then shot into the air before they came to the gum designers.
Twenty police guards and five civilians were hurt, he says.
There was no immediate reason why gum projects that are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as less dead alternatives, apparently caused a high dead range.
This was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern Nelu Mount, where the members of the ethnic group of Maddesi say that they have created a new province under a new statement, and he has affected their political impact.
Other demonstrations in Western Neèla were also designated by the ethnic group of Tharus, which requires the appearance of its own country.
Since August 10, at least 40 people were killed in violent sentences, including 11 police officers.
when the four main political parties signed the agreement on the distribution of the country into the province — a big step to meet the new establishment, but very poor question in Neèla, which was centrally managed over the center of the centuries.
Working for a new market settlement since 2008, the legislators have made a process after a devastated landscape, which killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators in Kathmand voted in this week on the provisions of the establishment and the officers claimed that the new chart should be adopted by Sunday.
We're definitely not able to panic now.
After breathing on the ice of Mystery Lithuania, you did not even have a home dual with Sparty Hokeist (3:5).
You don't worry about a similar disastrous entrance in the extraligin like a year ago?
I hope nothing like it's going back.
Honorable people.
NHC provides 60% of the probability of the cycle southern from the Capverd Islands
The wide low system of approximately 350 miles (560 km) south from the southern Capverd Islands has 60 per cent of the appearance of tropical cycle in the next 48 hours, introduced to the United States National Urican Centre on Wednesday.
Another well-defined low-defined system of approximately u\u" between the Capverd Islands and the Small Antilami has also 60 percent probability of the emergency of the tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added a weather prognose with the seat in Miami.
Google's company has laid down a campaign with the aim of choosing 11 million dollars for flights.
The Google Inc (GOOGL.O) stated that the campaign, which aims to choose 11 million dollars for the humanitarian organization, helping thousands of birds who have shiped the European States at the time of the war of the devastated and poor countries.
Google announced this in his blog a very unusual way.
The report on her blog published by the employee of Googlu Rita Masoud on the basis of personal experience, when she was seven years old with her family from Kabul.
"We traveled in many dark hairs and buses, and we lived hungry, honey, winter, and fear," said Masoud.
I was lucky.
But the deteriorating immigration crisis in Europe is still more family like that, willing to help.
All contributions will be divided between 4 non-request organisations assisting flights and immigrants: Medicals without border, International Saving Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Flights.
Google noted that all the contributions made through the google.com/refugeeerelief are doubled up to $5,5 million.
Europe leads the biggest flights from the Second World War, most of them come from Syria, mentioned by four years of war, which has just gone to 4 million people this year.
Many people also flee from the war denied by Afghanistan, Jemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly obsessional diabetes, the surgery of disturbance may be useful
The results of the elimination of surgery for slightly obsessive people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too soon to say whether the deeply obsessive people with the type 2 diabetes live longer after surgery of disturbance than those who provide nonhirurgic treatment.
"The facts on the death of the market to show," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, expert in the surgery of disturbance, who wrote a leader to a new JAMA surgery study.
Operations for disturbance, bariatric surgery are used to decrease the sugar of different methods.
Decrease of famine and human body restriction to absorb food.
During the years, bariatric operations showed that the treatment of diabetes type 2, but the frequency of investigation was performed in persons with morbid obesity with body weight index (BMI) with a value of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measure the weight related to the height, is considered normal in values between 18,5 and 24,9.
The BMI values 25 or higher indicate the surface of the person and persons with a value exceeding 30 are considered to be obscure.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Min-Sheng hospital in Thai-wan used data stored from the study since 2007, which includes two kinds of bariatric surgery - a scarce bypass and gastrektomy - in treatment procedures of type 3 diabetes in people who were quite obsessive.
The average BMI between those who were undertaken of the operation has fallen from 31 to 24.5 to the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, BMI remained those who had not been prescribed for the surgery of diabetes, almost the same as 29.
The diabetes was completely resolved in 36% and partially in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, the diabetes was completely solved in only 1 percent and partially in approximately 2 percent of patients.
Furthermore, the control of blood pressure, trigylcerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol was shown "commonly better in the chirurgical group," the authors discovered.
Scientists also monitored the level of hemoglobin A1c in the blood that reflects the blood sugar refrigeration in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is the best to maintain under 7%, indicates researchers.
After the operation, the average haemoglobin A1c increased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the treatment group, this value remained at approximately 8 percent.
But this better "glykemic control" - which reflects in better levels of hemoglobin A1c - did not reduce death in five years, according to the main researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operation.
After five years, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrektomy group (18.7 to 14.2 kg), reached more BMI reductions (7.4 to 5.1) and A1c hemoglobin (3.1 per cent against 2.1 per cent) and had more probability of diabetes reduction (46.9 per cent against 16.7 per cent).
While a new study does not show improvement of survival or survival after five years, there are evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that the surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the Ar’na College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to Sweden’s study, obsessive people who were undertaken by a warrant operation had about 29 per cent of the chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to the group that tried more conventional methods.
Although a new study has not shown a improvement in survival among patients after surgery, the Blackstone states that this is a calm outcome for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This work is critical here because it indicates that there is a safer surgery in a group with a lower BMI," it states without increased risk of death or renal disease.
Blackstone also further states that people and their doctors should begin to weigh the weight of reality seriously after BMI's decrease between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too much for people to give up the seriousness of people," he says.
I think if once the replacement of these genetic changes, which are strongly presenting their body with obesity and sugar, the way back is really hard.
"It is impossible that everyone come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to capture all the flights, mentioned Dalai Lama, and added that the true solution to the current flight crisis is on the nearest east.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader invited to end the violence in the lands of flights.
Dalajlama was concerned about the issue of the running aeroplane crisis in his statement when the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is a study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He claimed that in the present circumstances, the interest of mankind should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even the continents.
He also highlighted that the response of the West European countries, whether or not wonderful, to the aviation crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible that everyone come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama appreciated the efforts of Germany and Russia in the crisis, he stressed that it was just a temporary solution.
"Taking about a few thousand birds is beautiful, but you will have to think about the solution to bring peace and development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We have to limit the use of power.
The use of power has never solved these problems," he added.
In the solution of the issues of violence, Dalai Lama also discussed complaints on George Bushe after a 9/11 terrorist attack and claimed that "the violent reaction of the United States has caused an incontrolable event.
After 9/11, I expressed a sincere contrition in the letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to resolve this problem was not a violent way.
I know that his motives were good, but he used power and created unexpected investigations," said Dalailam.
Fourfold growth of the number of children who have experienced the health factor in the last 4 years
The Toxicological Centre around the United States has reported a 400-percent growth since 2010 in the number of children to 12 years that have been highly alcoholic health, according to the toxicological centre in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopeze, director of the Toxicological Centre of Georgia, the level of health in children to 12 years reported at the control centre of food increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"The children are more common to these products and, unfortunately, there is a percentage of children that must be brought to preparation," said Lopez CNN.
Some kids drink sanitation ́s intentionally, while some want to make their friends an incidence or a challenge to social media.
Videos on Youtube show natives how they drink sanitation ́s because of a lifted puzzle.
Nactils have evidently mixed the sanitation with the mouth water containing alcohol for stronger drinks.
Young children can be attached to the attractive wool of the Âca.
"The children don't think that it could hurt them," Lopez said.
The most attractive (sanitation ́s) are those who are parphemated.
For diposition, sanitations with ovens of jahode, grepe or pomegranates are very mild for children.
The sanitation is between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
In particular in small children, a number of places can mean alcohol.
"It's about highly concentrated alcohol," said the Fox 4 station in Kansas City Medical Director of the Control Toxicological Centre to Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't let the whiskey whiskey switch, too, but people leave these healthy sheets out, and when children get to them, it's the way to consume alcohol.
Nhayah Russel, a six-year-old girl who has recently watched up to four centuries of a healthy agent with the oil of jacket and was taken for treatment for preparation.
Her alcohol level in the blood was .179, which is a double part of the pulmonary value considered to be breathe in adults, according to Dr. Chrise Ritchey, the preparation doctor who cared about it in Gwinnett Medical Centre outside Atlant.
Nhajah expressed invisible words and did not be able to be conducted after she reached the preparation.
The doctors monitored her throughout the night in a single child hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell and washed in the head, says Ritchey.
"It was very terrible," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Nhayah's mother.
It could have been mortal for my child.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers the use of non-alcohol products or to arrange for healthcare from children.
Despite alcohol greed, some sanitations have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontaria died after the sanitation of the health, which contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Medicines believed that the product contains methanol, the mortal factor, rather than ethanol that was indicated as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth year in North New York planned to remove their "mal" artists by the location of antibacteria products after room," according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to healthcare and prohibited their presence in the room.
Police assessed the dead plan as "unschuldige trial" and referred to the discipline of the school quarter,
Female: No failure in the Celtic team
Griffiths bagateles the words of unsultation in Celtics, while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he will turn it back.
Hearts will fight with SFA against Neilson's attack and Warburton's worrying that the new positions from January will break the unit of the team.
Dons increases their shopping over Celtic by 5 points
Penalta from the first half of the delivery of ADAMA Rooney forced Aberdeen to gain close victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, thanks to which Dons had received five-five-scale cross between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths supports talks about non-soulation
This is the result of the injury in Celtics, which was deprived by Griffiths, who continues that he and his partners do not work under any pressure of the increased supervision in preparation for the shipment with the leaders of the Netherlands League.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the player's happy.
Missing in Scotland Title Rivality offers Netherlands - de Boer
The former funder Rangers and former representative of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer claims that the Netherlands fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivality between them for the purpose of the title.
De Boer, who is currently the commander of Ajax, says, "In the Netherlands, they do not show the best of Celtic stocks, and why?"
Because there's no Rangers there anymore.
Now people are not talking about the return of Rangers.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams of docromades, and they're just interested in it.
On the backs of the Old Company, there is a big pressure and not only people from Scotland follow these games.
I'll turn things back to the good, Deila's binding.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a little cool, but the Norwegian boss had committed that things would turn back to the good.
Malm's wound and the following outcome from the Misters' Ligy was followed by the wound against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now runs on the top of the table with five-foot shopping.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already lived a bad period and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know that it's very frustrating, and people are right, really hurt or fatigued by the current action.
We're totally the same, but we've got to go.
Actually, we really support Celtic, because it's a much better player.
Now it's very important to stay with him.
Warburton's worried about the yellow position
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago and pointed out that he already identified some of his yellow goals, the boss Rangers Mark Warburton has fear of sending a big purchase, and he does not want to interrupt the team with Ibrox.
The former boss Brentford says, "The railway window is very different from the year."
Players who are coming in the summer have a whole pre-session period of invitation, which you could see on our own team this meal.
The team is really good.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding unnecessary players to those you really do.
The cross-border goal of Michu indicates the department to the income
The attacker Swansea Mich, who was connected to Celtic in a transitional window, pointed out that after his discharge with Swansea could go to the income.
The twenty-year-old shooter has two years of problems with a low-shooter and hasn't been able to find the way out of Wales this year.
Hearts will fight with SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts conducted 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the clothes and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on this department was post-released - one of the third red card issued by Colum, which was revoked.
Neilson stands after his claim and says, "I didn't doubt integrity, I didn't comment."
Griffiths committed to avoid Tynecastle
The Hibbe warmly warned after he admitted that he sang a song with a text that was related to the former Hearts Rudolfu Scacel player.
Incidence was played at Roserburn in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tinecastle in March 2014
"It was about derba, and it was a scared moment," the attacker said and continued, "I can safely say I'm not going back to Tynecastle if it doesn't come in the Celtic dress."
Council in Tannadice in Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that Dundee United Council is still in the correction of the current team management - but admits that the disaster must end.
I think Stephen Thompson's gonna be inside us.
We'll prepare the boy again for action," Don'y promises.
MCInnes is for "super victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team must have been able to keep up against Hamilton Accies so that they could get the seventh ligue victory after him and the five-four-foot-scoop before Celtic on the top of the table thanks to the penalty from the first half of Adam Rooney's delivery.
McInnes says, "There's no team who wins anyway, or toughs or ligues, without wining this type of stocks."
Scotland unemployment remains unchanged while the total UK unemployment is standing
NEMESSION in Scotland remains without changes in the number of 164 000 during the period between May and July, while the total amount of unemployed in the UK was of 10 000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment measure of 5.9 per cent was exceeding the UK rate (5.5 per cent), as showed by the National Office (ONS).
During the period of three months, the employment in Scotland decreased by 12 000 people, now the number of workers stopped with 2.612.000.
The employment measure in Scotland decreased to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - which is over the British average.5 per cent.
The Secretary of the State of Scotland David Mundell said in a comment on the latest data: "The long-term government plan has placed bases for stronger economy."
This is exactly the year that Scotland made the historical decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we were witnesses of further improvement in the job market and the Scottish employment grows while the unemployment fell down.
Why I was a Witness of the Reform in Oklahoma
After this day, despite the late legal intervention, I will follow the death of a man.
This will happen, and I hope it won't happen, I'll sit in a view gallery in the Oclahom State's death room and see Richard Glossip, who will be restored to death injections.
He asked me to be one of the four officers who will be witnesses to his death.
I received an invitation first in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day comes near, I'm starting to be afraid of it.
So why am I doing that?
I've accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way I can tell you all the story of death.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to follow the corrections in America and because they are often more demand than free places, they are conducting a morbid lottery that will decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to 5.
Whoever is chosen will follow the whole correction unexpectedly.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit on the nearest friends of Richard Glossip, and I've created a special place with him through a month of phones and one two and a half hours of visit.
I like that boy.
Often we laugh when we talk together.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a note block and I can't mention what I'm going to see.
I'll have to remember all the details soon.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter that I compromise my independence.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of chovance as it will be done to him, get access.
I've been getting her.
She admitted that "that could formulate better," but she also think that what I'm doing is bad.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did it, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could ever remove me from the list of witnesses.
But he wants a international journalist who will be ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the crime of death.
Who Bellware, a journalist from Huffington Post, will be on my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to a series of subcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of a companion of crime.
But I believe there's a big probability that he's innocent of the murder.
I'm determined to believe that there has not been a sufficient quantity of evidence to justifie the death penalty.
I think the correction is bad.
And I'll just follow his death from this perspective.
I can't say I'll be real objects.
You can turn to another journalist.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing a man I have to die indefinitely death.
The man fled from Canning River after the police hunter
The Watchtower Canning Vale remained dry after he dropped a man from Canning River.
The demand of Peter's man that he fled by the police did not go out after he got into the poor bathroom water just a meter from the policeman who tried to convince him unusually to return to the edge.
The police from Canning Vale was called on the incident that passed to Beckenham on Wednesday.
When they saw a suspect, he tried to escape them from the Canning River.
But he didn't get away.
"He stood in the water and repeated I'm not going out, just come for me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Lachlan Perhavec was just trying to get a uniform, so he tried to use more safer tactics and this police negotiation."
"The people sometimes try to do when running funny things," said Castledine.
The football champion Ben Cousins gives a memory example.
In 2006, Cousins was sitting in the car to get out of the bus and trying to cross through the Swan River.
His efforts were crazy, but he inspired the locals to begin planning the Ben Cousins biaton.
Peter Moody claims that the computers have tried to spy and threaten the end of the bathrooms.
Peeter Moody accused Sergeant Racing Victoria that he was trying to get a spider and threatened that he would immediately finish the distraction.
He focused on the Officer and the Department of Integrity Racing Victoria and rejected the conviction that he had a personal campaign against him with lady Tatai's late covering at the day of the bathroom, which was the last cup in the middle.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he tried to do what was best for conducting and felt in a difficult situation regarding Lidarin's position on cobalt that can't explain.
He fell into the language about a spinner accusation for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "sushed horrible".
"I didn't want to say anything about that I've been sitting on it, but you just feel so frustrated that it will come out of you at the same time," said Moody.
They know that it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the results, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'll go home today and sleep well.
Just walk up with the head and let the owners think I'm doing the maximum for them.
If they're trying to think about it, I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm gonna do my licences.
Before Moody released in his conversation for racing.com bomb that the integrity of the division tried to spy.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in the room with a man - who I'm going to appoint - and offered him employment in my stages because he would find out information about things that are being done in my stages," said Moody at Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a foolish one.
That's right, all of them should show their information because they've been trying to catch me completely burning.
Robert Roulston, former President RVL, David Moodie, current president RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current RVL General Director, were the same at the time, and they are today.
Should I think that's a personal matter?
Does RVL give up a couple of bubbles and arrange people outside the training position to take responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
I'm wrong for this industry?
I'm really so bad for this idea?
Maybe more people now think so.
Maybe they're going to take my license and throw me away and I don't doubt what I'm saying will give them the material to think.
But I got to the point when I don't care about it anymore, and I'm quiet of it.
I was really disappointed.
I'll press them and put them on them soon to make decisions.
I have support for my family and I can go away.
The trainer's frogs have increased with an investigation for cobalt for Lidar's carefulness and recent inflammation in it has raised the feeling that "they could have a hour of his licence on the table."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of an unexpected Black Caviar champion, marked the rule of treatment on the day of the bathroom as "smile" after the horse was applied to the foot of a cloud surrounding or a blate, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of destruction.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
Someone of my team missed his legs.
It could have been last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it also happened.
It happened on the day of the bathroom.
Moody was a three-month dissimulation for the treatment of the circuits on the day of the bathroom to which the operators had already been monitored.
It's funny.
People who create these rules don't know anything about horses.
"All of us understand that we have rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.
The Cobram driver who was arrested was arrested
The police arrested the man who hit the cycle on the weekend in Cobram and went away.
The cyclist was transported aircraft to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious damage after the main route of Murray Valley was placed on Saturday.
The police said the engineer was leaving without stoping and helping the wounded driver.
On Monday, the fifty-year-old man of Nathalia admitted himself to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused of failure in case of accident, disturbance of aid and other transport transactions.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobrama, stays in the hospital in a stabil state.
Trener Melbourne Stormıig Bellamy returns to rivals because of the wrestling firm
Êig Bellamy, trainer Melbourne Storm, criticized the steps of his players as "building a plan" for two NRL favorites Primeship.
Trent Robinson, trainer Sydney Roosters, said that the decisions were allowed to players Storm to "speak" his player during the controversial victory of the Storm team at the final in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, the trainer Brisbane Broncos, made a lightly embraced note on Strorm after his team won finally over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening when he called the game as "observation" of the ligue rugby and according to two of Queensland were not "too big" to wrestling.
Bellamy protected his players' steps and said they were focused on "contact".
Bellamy added that this consciousness increased his self-consciousness because his team was criticized by two leader trainers, which may mean that he was afraid of the destruction of the Storm team.
"I don't remember that Trent Robinson would talk about a wrestling when we were hit 24-2," he said in the middle of Bellamy.
I can assure that we have not changed anything from our defensive system and technology in the last weeks, but we have just focused on contact during the courses, and it means to turn on us.
Trent has been here for three years and is obviously training a great team, so probably not normal to lose, which could be a little shock.
It's funny how such things will come in this year.
Bellamy deceived Bennett's idea of "reducing Bal" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team of St George-Illawarra Dragons wined in 2010 with a "nudge" play.
Wayne's talking about an exciting ball.
He was true that his Sunday game was similarly exciting as ours. She was also exciting," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized because they were a nausea team and Wayne said that it's totally worried about him.
But now he has a team that can play a game that seems disgusting to him, especially his young composers with their affection.
You would like to play such a game if you had this type of players available.
This opinion said in 2010, and now he wants all the teams to play his bal -- but not every team has two bookmarks such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so this one doesn't play.
It's more self-conscious in me because they're saying things like that because they're worried about anxiety against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably did not even think of us when they reached great stocks.
Bellamy also pointed out the fact that the Storm and Roosters have fallen more than Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos team game was probably good, I didn't look, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two other trials, but is it exciting?
Or is it interesting that interruptions and uncovering attempts are interesting?
I think that's the calendars.
And when they mention us, it means that we're going to meet again in a stage.
Storm has this weekend break and have won the right to host or North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks at the preliminary final next Sunday evening in AAMI Park. The letters will be sold from the next Wednesday.
Serbian man gained a café 200 000 USD for drug accusation
The man who had a potential survival of 40 kilograms of cocaïne that was spent from Queensland got a cooking of 200 000 USD.
Marko Maxsimovic (29 years old) was one of the five men who arrested the Federal Police last month after 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay Jachto, which came from South America through Vanuatu and killed Coomer in August.
Maximimovic was watched at the meeting with the accused in the court during the afternoon and met them in Coomera Roadhouse coffee, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Despite the potential survival for the ownership of cocaine of commercial quality, the lawyer Maximo put a complaint that there is no evidence that he would own the whole amount and that it could be in the café completely in a case and in innocent café.
The Court of High Court Peter Flanagan believed that Maxsimovic would flee.
He's got a lock on Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of the court.
In the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Mother and the non-private father Maximo offered a café of 200 000 USD for his release.
"When they read the jury statement of both persons, it is evident that the charge of 200 000 USD is a financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their effort alone was apparently inadequate because the accused was not further at the court, he warned.
Maximimovic has been granted a cow under the submination that it seems as the Australian and Serbian pass, it will be reported to the police daily and will keep the prohibition of exil from 18 hours to 6°.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to order pedofils to send images
Pedofil used a 11-year-old girl's phone to get children's misuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she slept, then logged in on her online chat, where she had a lot of unrespected photos of kids who sent him another person.
Then the girl tried and found her missing phone and found him in the hand of Hogga sleeping.
She went through him, and before she warned her mother, she found anxious reports.
Police joined and saw five photos, after the analytic computers found the address and discovered "inquired" search on the web using expressions for searching for children's images.
Hogg later claimed to the cops that his damn was to "build pedophiles" on the Internet before he had "predicted that he was a police officer and feared them."
The Fiscal Representative Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said that it was dependent on fear of people.
He admitted that he was searching on computers, but he claimed he just wanted to claim that he was a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was asked for his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send another.
He's doing it to get them on.
He claims that he's gone in drinking and said he wants to see the images of violence and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When the girl found a news on her phone, he called her mother, she wept and wept.
She saw no images on her phone, and then he was regreted.
The girl was listened and talked about how appealed he used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls that looked much younger than he.
Hog, 23, resident in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted the guilt for the complaint on the adoption or advice of unfair images of children on 14 June past year, distorted the cooking of the cooking on 25 January and was not allowed to hear at the court on 24 March of this year.
The lawyer would Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be placed on the list of sexual delicts, because he can argue that in his action there was no "principal sex subtext".
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael sent a sentence on October for the reporting of social workers.
Hogg was in this case assigned a cow, but he was kept in an engagement before hearing about the final unsolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual delicts before his judgment date.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe has proposed a bad statement in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest leader of Africa, fell on the stairs of leaders to the ground in this year.
He was not hurt, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
The opening Parliament was also contaminated by the statements of opposition legislators that they received anonymous murders that were warned before Mr. Mugabe in his statement.
The last month, he was exhausted and provoked during his statement of the statement of the people in Parliament - which is the word he repeated on Wednesday.
The President of the Deputy Club for Democracy Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition policies adopted text reports on their mobile phones with warning not to prevent Mr Mugabe's statement.
"The report comes from the numbers that are not displayed but called 'death'," he reported to journalists after Mr. Mugabe's word.
It warns the members concerned to declare that immunity ends in Parliament and that their parliamentary immunity does not work as soon as it is a year from the parliament.
The leader noted that the side Morgan Tsvangirai has "approximately" on the issues.
Hewlett-Packard wants to reduce the number of jobs to 30 000.
Hewlett-Packard cancels 25 000 to 30 000 jobs in its efforts to restructure and support the costs of business services.
The HP company will share in two cotted companies on the burst in this year and separate trade with computers and printers from their growing fire hardware and services operations.
The expected decrease in the number of jobs will have a change in the range of $2,7 billion and will come to the beginning in the fourth quarter, indicated in the HP statement.
"This restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable expenditure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," Meg Whitman, Director-General of HP and President of the representation, which will be at the head of the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a broad and broad trade portfolio that will help business travel to a new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to fulfil our customers' requests worldwide.
Hewlett Parkard Enterprise will have more than $50 billion after the company's announcement of an annual income and "will be focused on providing unconcurrently integrated solutions" by the company.
This will happen to the division of the company founded by the representatives of the Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the manufacturer of electric equipment, and their garage in Palo Alto was excited by the Silicon Valley birth.
HP has passed a mass of reorganization in order to move from traditional personal computers to mobile equipment.
This HP company, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical fires in America, is the latest of this sector based on convincement that the highly specialised company has better results.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Artet says that the players have to get for the wounded Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also highlighted for Wilshere that he is still in September and if his rehabilitation goes in accordance with the plan, he doesn't want to play again on Sundays.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly mix at least four other african games and, in view of the history, his involvement in the next annual European magistership is apparently unfair.
The big damage of this newer problem is that Wilshere has completed the past with a strong man after the wound and then returned to the former form during the presidence.
"This kind of hurt doesn't threaten the career," says Wenger.
It's the ́na which requires treatment.
It doesn't matter anything special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his kidneys or the hurt he suffered before.
This could be from a clear medical view of the truth, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of other hurt whenever any player returns during his life.
Here also appears an inappropriate pattern.
The research conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. mentioned 23 different wounds of Wilsher since six years ago.
During the last five years, he only played in 65 ligue stocks of Arsenal from the total number of 157:
From the larger perspective for Arsenal, this means that in the six of the eight season from 2007-08, one of the two Premier League clubs was lost most days from the damage.
Wenger accepts the potential of the inhibited circle, but Arsenal does not make it possible that improvement in the injury mentioned during the last season will continue.
"Speaks, when you return after the wound, you have a vulnerable period, the time you're able to strengthen your body and get a competition," says Wenger.
Jack's too young to get out of it.
I hope his body's stabilised, I'm sure he'll have a career he'll deserve.
Arsenal starts a campaign in Lisa Shampions on the middle night against Dinamo Zagreb the campaign with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next center, and Wenger is ready to rotate his team.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not sit in Croatia, that means that Matthieu Debuchy and Artet will probably be overcome.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nao Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and let players who do it, breathe," wears Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a favorite for the procedure of F group, Maximir in Zagreb has a story of the most terrific stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not affected in total of 41 storages after the past held the "unusual" campaign.
The stadium in the middle of the night was decreased by the landing 3.2 degree of Richter.
That was this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal has learned from the past Ligy champions, when he was able to join Monaco and remains remote to him that he will bring the club to the first victory in the European Fire.
"This saddle is bitter," says Wenger.
It never happened to the arsenal.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I must be realistic.
We're ambitional, but we're not snowers.
FriendsFest: Comedial show that gives us serious lessons about man's friendship
Absence of similar displays in different shows is in the sight of the striking, especially because of the need for men to be more delayed than ever, as regards suicide among young men to 15 years.
In 2013 it was the only biggest cause of death in men in Britain in 20-45 years and remains three times more frequent in men than women.
In trying to resolve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked 2015 as the Year of the Man, whose goal is to doubt a culture that prevents men from seeking help in the case of need.
In the heart of this battle, friendship is to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students showing depression symptoms has found that in the case of the damage had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "health injury", their chance of refusal was doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not in depression, it represents the circle of mentally healthy friends of half chance to result in mental problems.
But for friendship to work, it must, of course, be achieved first.
In this communication through social media with a view to it and not the content of the communication, the immediate response is often predicted before a meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need was doubled to look stronger, more loveful and successful, although we are actually more isolated.
This surface of success is controlled by what psychological names are called for external values; money, image, social status, all on our own values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have deep influence on our mental health.
And as one billioner and her creator recently explained, money really doesn't drink more lucky.
The beauty of the series of Friends was for the source of this idea.
No one of the laws has been defined by his work, but by their personalities that have caused friendship interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, a moment of following the ball on a pleasant cross, Ross' desire to Rachel, all the springs of knowledge that, yes, men can also identify themselves, even if they leave their feelings for themselves.
as a Samaritan worker explained to me: "My role of listeners who feel in depression or have self-morded inclinations confirmed me that even the smallest friendship interactions can be divided."
Men who contact us often feel incapable of communicating with friends.
The old order "reacting with it" is strong in the meaning that it will be considered weak to address problems.
Friends are one of the orders that will come up to me when I'm trying to offer a better balance mechanism.
He highlights the little châi in a man's friendship.
As regards my job, the outside state on the phone helps people at a minute of deficiency, but the support has to join more closer than friends and family networks.
So this weekend you're going to be at the FrandsFest organized by Comdy Central station, why don't you see your friends in the box in Central Perk, where the internal for the opportunity of celebration will be completely processed.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, laugh on and welcome him.
You never know what division your friendship can do.
Serial Friends will be sent to Comedy Central station from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
In Mary, he corrected and helped the PSG to join Malmo side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidim and Edinson Cavanim after the shot against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored at his debut in Lisa Masters and thus helped PSG hit the Swedish Malmo team on Tuesday.
Here's a news about the shopping and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in the district and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in Liza of Masters with final comfortable winning 2-0 against Malma to Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot less than four minutes after his debut in Liz Masters, and this PSG player sent French champions after the victory, but they took a few chances, until they finally increased their speech when Cavani shot his head in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in group A, and therefore Paris's team needed a strong start against Swedish champions, because they are not only focused on the racing rounds, but to improve their road to the fourth final that they mentioned in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they got three points, it was not the classic performance of Lauren Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic's team was before a marnorate and post-limited against his home team and club in which he started his career review in 1999.
"In Lisa of Masters, it is not easy to win outside or home, so winning 2-0 makes our problems against the people and looks likely in the defence is a good start, even though there are things we'll have to improve with the process of improvement," said Bla.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot on one or two more.
Ibrahimovic returned after the wound as one of the three changes of the PSG team, who held this weekend 2-2 with Bordeaux in Liza 1, but was shadowed in the fourth minute in Di Mariou.
The Argentina Fly was marked as a man who moves PSG in Europe to a new level after a transition from Manchester United, who passed the past month, and showed why when he walked on Marca Verratti for the defense of Malma and with a beautiful suspension, he sent a ball behind the back of Johan Wilanda to a remote corner.
However, if someone expected it to start a big PSG victory, he had to be disappointed.
The small one that hit Celtic in play-off and reached this stage occurred with 9 internationals in the basic building, and five defenses and two stakeholders were a hard contest.
But besides Nikola Djurdjice's shot, which just passed the remote corner of Kevin Trappa in 34 minutes, they didn't offer it much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves took advantages from the attack of bad adjudications and mixtures that were not good nor by Ibrahim, who couldn't shoot five times in the first half, and then was disappointed because his shooter reached the network shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
Nevertheless, he showed himself much more appropriate when it came to prepare a chance for her partners and it was just from his record when Di Maria sent a precise shot that ended in Wilanda after 52 minutes.
Druhi → finally came after a hour of game thanks to Cavani, this Uruguay's headquarters sent for the sixth season after Ibrahimovic got to him after the intake from the left wheel from Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts of Malma about the possibility that they could get something out of the stock, and only the exceptional progress of Wilanda from the great neighborhood defeated David Louise and the skin remained unchanged even at the time when the corresponding Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the stock.
The trainer of the Malmo Age Hareide team admitted that the PSG was classified above his team, Nor said: "Our last game in Lisa Masters has passed in the past year."
Since that time, we've just played a Swedish ligue that's not at the same level.
Qualification facilities are lacking.
Bottom down for Paris.
For them, it was an amazing story.

Glencore with a seat in Switzerland, which was awarded by the commodity prices, has spent $2,5 billion from the sale of action in its comprehensive debt reduction plan.
The Glencore company states in its statement that she sold a new share of approximately £6 billion to pay the debt.
This company, who has lost 57 per cent of its market values this year, is decreased by commodity prices, since the Chinese economic decline decreases the application and deteriorates the deficiency of the market.

The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jin.
The Chinese President Xi Jin visits the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in his afternoon report.
During the visit of President Xi in Washington, on September 25, in Barack Obama's reaction to the visit to Peking, where the president visited in November, the report was reported.

Like fucking crises, the Shanghai's spatial waste.
The new lights from remote Germany did not distort the European property, but it has already brought a ship to change the course, wrote the French journal Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to go forward to the problem of flights: it will be more systematic to classify asylum and asylum demanders as soon as it goes into the old continent - especially in Greece than to think about the future distribution of flights according to the quota based on a quantity that is still more remote in reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker requested 25 of the 28 EU countries to re-distribute 160 thousand flights, the Ministers inside the Member States have changed the priority.
Before looking for the final destination of running, it is necessary to filter those who come today and resolve the judgment of those who are already moved within the Schengen space.
"Effects of the EU's external border management is necessary for control," it emphasizes the text of the negotiated Ministry on Monday in Brussels.
After a joint currency crisis, the EU finds it in danger in its next large integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it doesn't fail his decision and increases the pressure.
It renews the controls of employment, particularly with Russia, but without blocking the impact of those seeking asylum in this country.
The central power shows that there is no free move in Europe without it.
As a evidence, the fact that Russia and Slovenia were connected to this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, and even France also consider it, even though it is different.
Hungary has been added to this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are allowed in accordance with Schengen rules.
It's about the dominant effect, but it's a blind one.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the introduction of mandatory input controls in Greece, South Italy and Hungary for those who have already entered into the interior.
The French Minister inside Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière acted intensely on this during their private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea isn't a new idea, but it's making a deceit.
In Italy, two thirds of new residents were already registered and identified by their fingerprints.
But he refuses to introduce any entry point on his territory because he fears more than the final, so that there are no camps on its threats where the flights would be crossed on it.
Greece remains in the actual black hole.
On his islands near the Turkish coast, more than 200 thousand people were attended in the year of the year, which was two times more than recently reached Italy.
Most of them are asylum demanders who came directly from Syria after the overflow camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge opening.
Atenas, which are still in financial divergence and are waiting for a new government, have put their hands in the clone.
This is the default point for the Balkan Road and the source of the common age for the German office of Angel Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Commission of Juncker promises that the implementation of control points will take place as soon as possible, but it has not introduced any number or date.
"The calls to Greece are related to all Europe," the EU Ministers agreed on mobilization on this front on Monday.
It is, therefore, to place the European Agency for the Control of Frontex borders in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for the receipt of asylants and strengthen the supervision of the islands.
"The need for adjusted financial resources" warns the text submitted to the Ministers to approve.
In view of the rights, they will continue to have the last word of Athena.
The question of the emergency of European guards was not officially raised, but Europe approaches it.
The new nutrition of eight-year-olds as so addressed the second series of committee issues and 160 thousand volleys, which Juncker's Commission and the European Parliament had taken a strong support for Angela Merkel and French President François Holland at the beginning of the year.
Hungary, Slovenia, Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear.
They think it's an attack on their sovereignty.
Initially, not but obligation, he was kept in the text approved by the eight-year-old text on Monday.
But as a political commitment.
Otherwise, the process has been interrupted.
The only strong promise includes the re-distribution of 40 thousand flights in the next two years, which has already been achieved in June during the EU hectary summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead dead under the lavine in Alîch, mostly three Czech.

Slovak to the introduction of the main stage of competition, he welcomes the finalist from 2011 Bragu and according to the bowl she wants to introduce her hernial.

"Trpišovski said to the print.
Brag thinks the top team.
It will be very active, owned by the Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The opposite may be even more difficult about having no such name, but then there is a player that gave to Manchester the thirty-three.
"It's a great whole at the top level of teams," said Trpišovski.
It doesn't think Bragu's favorite.
I'm taking it so we're playing home, so we're definitely not outsides.
"I think we have shown that we are strong at our stage, and that we want to confirm," said the kitchen, whose team was lost from the eleven duals of this season only the introductory Superpohar in Plzni.
He believes Liberec can also put Braza in his hands.
We're waiting for a team that will be strong on the batch, and it's not disciplined for them.
They play from 4-4-2 disinstallation with a ≥ transition to an attack phase.
"It's very hard against a cup, even though we've discovered weaknesses, but it'll be the most important way our players' players will run on a shot," Trpišovski said.
In the past, we studied a lot of controversy, which helped us very much this time, we wanted to focus on our game, which we even adapted the trains.
"And we absolutely want, even though it's very urgent to play according to our notes," added a shot.

In the case of the CK, it has the security to play customers' charges in full.
The assurances should play customers' claims in the case of the road of the Office in full height.
She decided that in the middle of an approved new legislation on the conditions of business in the way of movement.
The road of offices will be able to replace insurance against the bank's fall by guarantee, in accordance with the proposals intended to be reviewed to Senate.
Insurance with the obligation to comply with customers' claims does not even agree over a single limit.
The Ministry of Local Development takes place, arguments for the protection of the consumer.
The guarantees have already threatened that it will end the assurance of travel offices against crafts when it'll pay news.
But we're criticising the road of offices.
Without ensuring, they will have to end or go to the foreign.
The Minister for Local Development Karla Šlecht (for the United Nations) pointed out that the cases where insurance has not paid full refunds were not Eurocommunicated.
It noted the annual decision of the Court of Constitution, which confirmed that the client had a charge for full return of money without prejudice to the limit of insurance.
The guarantees will receive sufficient information on the economy of travel offices and will be able to determine the correct limit, highlighted by Slecht.
"We appreciate the effort to increase the protection of the consumer, but it must have such a limit to be achieved," opposed TOP president 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
Banko's guarantee works according to it because no one gives it an unlimited.
"This is what the officers will have to end or move to the hall," Kalousek warned.
The Chairman of the Czech Travel Office Association and the Agency Tomio Okamura (SPD) with Kalousk's concerns on the basis of the investigation between members of the CK.
"Stop us leading lobbing insured," said he.
The exposure of insurance does not constitute Okamura as relevant, no official written expression in this sense exists in accordance with it.
They also find out whether the road of offices will be associated, which is not a problem according to Okamury.
Before the establishment, she warned Jana Fischer (ODS), which referred to the establishment of the Competitive Association of Travel Offices of the CR, and her side co-worker Peter Bendl, who spoke about the deletion of stages by the Czech road.
The road of the offices according to Fischer's ability to deal with the assurance.
"The protector works," Court Fischer.
She didn't approve of us to release the passports.
He did not even come to Philip's soldiers (KSCHM) with us to return the proposal to the Committee due to a particular conflict with the citizen law.
Philip warned about the road of agencies that may be threatened by the needy.
The rapporteur of the proposal of Martin Berdych (ANO) in the light of the Verification of the Court of Justice, has been able to limit the responsibility insured in cases where they cannot conclude that the successful fulfillment would not cover the whole risk.
The minimum four million insurance limit for the road of the offices offering air carriers, and the million of offices selling for example autobus liabilities.
The border remains to 30 per cent of the planned markets from the sale of the sales of the enterprises.
However, the limits of the successful fulfillment must be such to cover all customers' claims in case of the road.
The Norm also states that the Agency's travel will have to re-determine in the sale of enterprises that organize the travel of the travel office.
The road of offices will have to submit to the assurance before closing with other information on economic and the number of interests.
The approved amendment to the Public Administration Committee shall also be assessed with further regular information.
The road will be required to provide for them every month information on the number of traveling and selling commitments, the total price of the sales of enterprises and the higher stocks and markets for travels and for orders on them.

There may be a new department of beds in the Carlovarian country.
According to the Headman of Karlovar, Jacob Panika (CSSD) is the current capacity of two national hospitals and two private diseases in the country of sufficient and prolonged adjustments to be made on the basis of the agreement between individual disease divisions.
In the country, however, there are also opportunities to expand care.
For example, in the division of surgical divisions, the center of a single-day surgery, where, according to the designed concept, operations of chirurgical divisions that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours.
In which specific diseases the job should be addressed to a single-day surgery, it is still not possible.
In the skin division of Karlovy Vary’s hospital, there could be a laser centre with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the emergence of an apal centre, which would be concerned about patients with a brain-capacity that are in the vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be part of the integral anestesiological and resuscitative division.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such equipment in the island hospital, where there is already similar care.
Another cancer capacity that seems to be inadequate in the country of Karlovar is an insufficient dog of follow-up care, especially the dog of Treatment of the Sickness (≥ N), whose capacity in the Nedk is inadequate and should, in particular, rather than refer to an acute care dog.
The part of this equipment should function as a song of rehabilitation and part as a classic LDN bed, recommends concepts.
As he warns, the lake of the next care is mainly missing in Karlovy Vary’s hospital.
There they could use leaved buildings after centralization.
In the nearby series of countries in Karlovar, social health beds are abstentioned by the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
These lobbys are insufficient in the entire Republic, so it may also serve for the rest of the countries as called Alzheimercentrum.
In accordance with the recommendation, hospitals should also be prepared for the establishment of such agencies which will be released by the financial contributions of Europe.
"It's about a bed that will refer to a subspecialized care and will create a space for translation of patients after the progress, such as cardiochirurgical, neurochirurgical, transplanting or other steps," describes the national concept of dog care.
New services may also be offered in psychiatric care.
