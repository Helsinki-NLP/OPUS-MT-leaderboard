Rememberment of the very ananous ideal of work rights as human rights
The Congress Deputy Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organization of associations as civil rights.
"So as a company dies, the media-class jobs are also dead," Ellison, a democracy from Minnesota and a representative of the Progressive Caucus in the Congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the employer's authorisation law with the citizen's legal icon John Lewis.
This violating law gives workers the same legal opportunities to discriminate for the organization of agencies as in other forms of discrimination and stops such anti-operative powers.
The completion of national labour law to create a possibility for a discrimination of workers to organize a Community representation to complain about justice before a civil court and to obtain damage or penalty is a significant and necessary initiative.
But it is no radical initiative - anyway not according to standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors proposed of their legislation is to return to a very ananical idea.
Despite the reliefs that the communities have been exposed in the past years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - the Americans have encouraged one countries worldwide to recognize, expand and maintain work rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remembered when this country called democracy, freedom, press freedom and the right of association in a breathing tour.
When the United States after the Second World War II occupied Japan, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff were encouraged to decide a constitution that would ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full knowledge of the fact that workers and their associations played a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that expressly recognized that "the rights of workers to associate and common negotiations and actions are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Iisenhower and his staff forced the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers should organize themselves, and their voice in the new nation should be raised, the Germans have introduced a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish unions to ensure and improve the conditions of work and economic conditions is guaranteed to each person and to every profession or business.
Accords that endanger this right or aim to distort it are zero and negative; the objectives of this law are irregular.
When the former Lady Eleanor Roosevelt had the Presidence of the International Human Rights Commission, from which the General Declaration of Human Rights was determined, as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, the Roosevelt and the other committees introduced a guarantee that "each person has the right to establish or join businesses to protect his interests."
Since General, Americans accept the fundamental premiums that work rights are human rights.
When this country relates to other countries how civil and democratic societies can be formed, the Americans declared that the right to establish a community - and that this company should then participate in collective negotiations as equal partners with companies and governments.
After these rights have been spoken in America, it is really very wise to lead the idea of the Ananias, thus the people who work must have the right to join themselves and to listen in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the worker movement did not restrict the force of the nation, but increased it.
The highlighting of the live standard of millions of people has made work in a wonderful way a market for the industry and has highlighted the whole nation at an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story keeps them.
The story recalls, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of work rights as human rights - and the enlargement of the protection of citizens' rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employees - is long-term.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renewed the ideas that have made America great in the past and fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge stops timely law that all licensing clinics in Louisiana could force to close
A U.S. Court suspended the implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, by the advocate, saying that it would have caused the closure of all five discharge clinics of the State.
This measure, raised by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana in June and entered into force on 1 September, would force doctors to purchase a patient's adoption right in a hospital within a 30-mile radius for their practice.
However, the decision of the Judge means that the doctors may continue to carry out legal discharges temporarily while they have such a right.
"The complaints can continue to work in law agreement while seeking the acquisition of these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deG­elles in judgment.
A hearing for the judge shall be appointed within one month to make a more permanent decision for the law.
The deficiencies for people welcomed the decision of the youngest in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that the doctors had so much time to gain hospital instructions.
"The present decision means that women in Louisiana will take a sustainable law to their health and their rights," Nancy Northup, President and President of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, which had been charged in behalf of three of the five clinics of the State to keep the law.
It was not directly clear whether the sentence was drawn to the doctors from the two clinics that had not joined the complaint and also requested instruction rights.
Louisiana is one of the 11 countries who have adopted similar laws, whereas courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi not constitutionally.
The key places of a law in Texas, which most of the clinics remained in the state had been forced to close, were arrested by a federal judge on Friday.
The American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Requirement agrees that the instruction rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
The opponents believe that the measures served for the protection of women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only one ar ́ that performs discharges in Louisiana is responsible for patient information rights, shared the Centre for Reproduction Rights.
If all other doctors in the State are forced to do no longer deterioration, this Ar would exclude its security to not carry out the operation anymore, the group said.
In their argumentation against the sentence, the representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish any doctors for the implementation of discharges, while their requests for patient evidence were still dependent.
Suspended diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment opportunities lead to death rates through egg cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put a video home for their mother online that died in 2007 on egg cancer.
For women in rural areas, there is a risk to die in egg cancer as for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 egg cancers in 2005, and found that only 25 Pro ± 5 years after diagnosis were still alive.
Research leader Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the State, the risk of death during the 20% of the city areas was 20%.
SPECIAL STUDY: New medicines may delay long and egg cancer
The researchers examined the health care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, the type of egg cancer, existing pre - diseases and the social and economic status also affected the survival opportunities.
For elderly women and those whose cancer was already advanced at diagnosis time, the rate of survival was lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the State, the risk of death was about 20% as for those in urban areas.
Although the women who lived outside the city with probability of egg cancer did not investigate why they died outside the city, Dr. Jordan considers a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment than possible.
"This disease is best treated by geneological oncology, and most of these are to be found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of the telemedical services in order to resolve distances, she proposed as possible a strengthening of the service of invoiced doctors to provide specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that, independent of the geographical status, it was a bad long-term survival rate for women in egg cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and prevention strategy.
The financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in Medical Journal of日a.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old young mother from the gold coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of egg cancer.
Gardens injury deceiting householder payments
The decrease with an increased consequence of the number of householders under 35 years could lead to loss of gardens thousands of pounds per year when today’s young consumers are following a interval of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, which produces the "Kernel Group for Gardens Products".
The report states that the Mieter is a average of 55 per cent of the amount of people with their own home for their gardens.
The growth of people living in high urbanized areas without gardens, the popular procedure to approximately awards to parking and the slow garden sizes are additional gardens threatening the branch in which the estimated 5 billion £ per year will be applied in the sale.
In London’s large room, where the share of households has fallen from 61 to 43% over a period of 6 years, the lowest amounts for garden products per household are indicated.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society indicate that residents to the middle or small gardens don't mean that people can't drive roads.
Guy Barter, Chief Garden Adviser for the RHS, said: "Container gardens, for example, are very popular in the midsts because they can take their roads at a motion."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "good age" of the trade in the garden, due to increased domestic owners and economic welfare from the latest 1980s to the middle of the 1990s.
He also prognosed a improved market situation for this year because of the best weather, after unfair weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement mentioned by the Opposition Policy Imran Khan and the church Tahirul Qadri in Pakistan continues.
In the main city of Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators have disturbed the state television PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers would have been able to force the protesters back from PTV buildings.
The sender introduced his operation for about 40 minutes, but sent again in the meantime.
At the same time, approximately 3000 demonstrants seeked to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
A kilometer away from them, they offered cohesions equipped with stones and stones with security forces.
The police put the train gas in.
The demonstrants requested Sharif's receipt, but he refused it.
The army of the country, therefore, encourages a political solution to the conflict to "reduce without time and use without violence".
After a meeting at the main quarter of the Sunday, the military shared: "The army remains committed to their role to ensure the security of the State."
The military plays a major role in Pakistan and has already been more frequently disturbed.
The Opposition Policy Imran Khan proposes Prime Sharif to have been involved in the Parliament's election in May last year.
The protests were scaled on the weekend after Khan and Qadri called their attachments to prevent Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey recommends US diploma for spioning reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has introduced the US oldest diplomates in the country to inform a report on the Spanish and British Spionage in Turkey.
Vice-Premier Minister Bülent said that the U.S. Business and Turkish officers had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine The Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former U.S. Analysers of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major activity area for the US and British Secret Services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan played the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spioned each other.
An earlier report that the most important secret service of German Ankara in Vision also had invisible reactions of the Turkish Government.

We're calculating significant accidents.
Regional points do not give it.
The main orientation of the warning date is the trade of goods.
The German train in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects less possible.
However, the GDL did not say where she wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences concretely.
Police officer of Magaluf of corruption accused
The complainants presented evidence of pressure by police and employees in the city of Calviá on Friday.
The Chairman of Calvià's police on the vacation island Mallorca was arrested after corruption of business carriers and bar owners in the paid Binge-Dranking Hotspot Magaluf.
Major Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was taken in investigation by several business officers from Punta Ballena, the street where the most bars and night clubs of Magaluf lie.
According to the online journal Mallorca Diario, the complaints presented evidence of pressures by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the State Advocate of Corruption Mallorcas on Friday.
Two other local policies were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with corruption projects and were asked by a judge with Navarro.
The national Spanish journal ABC reported that the harmful Night Club owners claimed that the wheat economy of the authorities had serious effects on their business.
"It's no longer about money, it's about survival," said one of the business officers to the court.
Let our life base out the game.
We don't have anything to lose.
Magaluf made in this summer a viral YouTube-video international shield lines, in which a 18-year British tourist was shown, which was completed to 24 men during a supper tour of Fellatio.
Since then, the island members have tried to stop the correct behaviour of alcoholized accommodators in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the related alcohol-related kneepen tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the failure was located, was forced to close for a year while playhouse and the Kneipentour Organizator Carnage had to put together a penalty of $55,000 (73,000) for a year.
The tourist site Magaluf, especially in young British holidays, is also for some accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of the "balconing", where people walk from a balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first breakfast with nausea and weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has protected South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy sharks and strong winds, affecting flights from the aircraft Adelaide.
On the evening to 21, more 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already fallen on Sunday night.
The last disagreement was the result of a series of short, sturmish sights, a guesse that started shortly 20 hours ago and cared for almost 4mm decline in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided for a early dose breaking, the temperatures in the city returned to a maximum value of only 15,8°C on Monday.
The weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft had to land shortly after 19.30 a.m., but it was found by a wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction through a short distance - and it had to be started.
Wind breaks reached at this time about 50 km/h on the ground on the Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the flight also had to be launched in a second country attack and set around 20:40.
The flight delay led to late some other flights, a Emirate flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a highest temperature of 16°C is foreseen on Saturday, with possible screening.
Matthies says: Maximum time for big destruction
In view of the galopping technical progress that threatens our famous house to high-tech-scalculators, our Columnist Bernd Matthies draws up with an overlooked electronic access.
When I write this here, my cock falls on the spiral cable that connects the hearer to the phone, and I think, Boah, how back is this?
But behind it is a question: If the cable wasn't, all listeners would be in the latest time in the house, and it would be still more back.
Does it apply to the electronic (electronic?
No, Tip Error: Electronic) Sector's rule that the world's newness is covered from today's electroscore from tomorrow.
And for example, who has another R's television in the room today, only says that he denied the television.
Why are these discussions?
Because the refreshing of the ifa at the function tour this week brings us again our absolute incompetence in the issues of electronics.
The lay, who was dominated early washing machines and CD-players blind, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread with an unfair expert talk before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you still?
What is it to talk to people who obviously spread such a quarter?
In fact, it has been about 20 years, especially because we have to destroy our house.
In order to make the Joghurt itself to inform us the brand reporter at the holidays of the maledives that it is burning in the work room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we were from the Office from the climate facility on our quick arrival ...?
Yes, however, it provides a climate installation.
But a dream will certainly be true to him: We have our armband hours, you say "S ́en!" - and to the house the dust's robbers will go away.
I'm wrong.
Everything runs to nothing less than a revolution outside: "The limits between white and brain goods go away," draws a brainer, you can connect the wash machine to a head hearer, the dampfgarer sends the weather report and the data brilliant shows how long the pizza has been on the back tower, but it doesn't benefit because we are in silence.
We also know from the daily practice: If a newmodical device is actually used hardly, the battery is guaranteed empty.
What another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Streefing returned to schools on Monday after they had spent the summer in air protection rooms, while the racket and martyr shot on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools were closed in Gaza while the area was recovered from the battles.
The school start was a feeling of joy and expectation, but the signs of battle are still fresh.
In the southern city Ashdod, the worker of the "Pashosh" kidney garden found by a rake, before the students met Granates from the walls and shields.
"We have a little bit, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, inhabitant in Kibbutz Seed and English teacher there.
Children from our territory need the back to a routine.
His 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a little funny" to go back to school.
"There were difficult times, and we didn't at all go out of the house," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border of Gaza to offer its support.
Until a weapon standing the war last week, thousands of residents of the border communities like seed remained in their households or left their households to continue to go to safe areas from Gaza and escape from the racket and marble fire.
Property residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the border of Gaza, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian Morsergranate, was still delayed with the back.
The Ministry of Education shared about a thousand families still not returned.
Your children were temporarily subjected to other schools.
Premier Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city of Gaza, which was difficult from the Palestinian visit.
He invited the children to learn much and said, "We'll make sure that you are reverent and give you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on the last Sunday on an unexpected weapons condition.
The weapon stream provided a immediate end of the fights; however, important problems remain unsolved, such as the Hamas request after a revocation of the Israeli-Egypt blocked of Gaza and the re-opening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for a disarmament of the Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed by the battles.
A new indirect talk will probably be started this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of their civilians, and at least 494 children after the Palestinians and the United Nations.
Israel strives these information and appreciates that at least the half of the killed were warriors, but it did not provide specific evidence for these information.
On Israel’s side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thaiian worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza celebrated 4.591 rackets and marshgranates during the battle in Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
The Israeli military has also led more than 5.000 air and other attacks.
Thousands of households in the Gaza area protected or severe Israeli attacks and approximately 250,000 people seek refuge in more than 100 U.S. Schools, converted into temporary protection spaces.
Ten thousands of people continue to live in the protection rooms and walk the battles, and the educational discussions moved last week to the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that the school is soon open again so that we can continue learning as the children in the world and the Jewish children," Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently in a school in Gaza City.
By choice in Sachsen: CDU-Vize Stroble requests NPD prohibition procedures
In view of the vote loss of the NPD in Sachsen, the CDU-Bundesvice Thomas Strobl for the end of the current NPD prohibition procedure before the Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to the CDU agreements, Thomas Strobl should end the current prohibition procedure against the NPD before the Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is cutting worse than the last time," Strobl said, who is also a CDU country leader in Baden Württemberg, the "Leipziger Popular Journal".
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and development that makes me rather result in fighting the NPD politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD was completely unable to vote on Sunday at the five Pro height.
The first approach for the prohibition of the right-extreme party was failed in 2003, since the constitutional protection at that time had information in the NPD hospital.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council introduced a new request in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day did not act.
Harburg: Zelts for new refugees
In the new country, refugees are now subject to cells.
The central first collection for refugees in Harburg platform from all nearby.
Now the inner recipient has set up three cells of the red cross there.
The area politicians were recently informed - they are a little disappointed.
"These hauruck actions continue to disturb citizens' preservations and give the district policies no opportunity to contribute to human refugeeling," says Britta Herrmann, a group of Green in the Harburg District assembly.
Your party requests that the district administration of Harburg provide non-used households for delivery.
96 refugees can be placed in the three cells.
The reasons for transmission in the first receipt are the windstorm of assistants - and the condition that the authorities cannot provide sufficient places in the following facilities.
So refugees remain longer than the regular three months.
The household prices have reached the highest winter increase in seven years, showing a largely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for own homes in the Australian capital increased by 1,1 Pro in August, so the RP data from Monday.
This increase is the total increase in June, July and August at 4,2 Pro, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10,9%, more than doublely as the increase in 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not equally distributed over the country.
The research leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, shared that Sydney and Melbourne were two-sized markets.
The numbers of RP data show that the household prices in Sydney increased by 16,1 Pro in the past year, but in Melbourne by 11,7 Pro.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, in which the prices increased averagely about five and six pro.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which has been severely met by the insects in the state departments and where prices have increased only by 1.4 pro per year.
Mr Lawless continued to say that, with the beginning of the prejudice, there would be a growth in the future months of the immobility that would be subject to the market "a real test".
"If you consider the sustainable high rate of the auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the enduring low price environment, it is probably that the prices of your own home will continue to grow in the next three months," he said.
In a opinion on the New Press, he corresponds to the statements of the business leader Peer Medau and confirms the position of "as a fieldherr".
The style of the high school is not this, it is in the communication.
Thus, the Medau family has already been "mid June fully informed about the faces of the High School.
The statement that the plans were first in July is definitely wrong," so Pöttzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "pre-determinations or decisions" but "preferences" are available.
Moreover, the building of the broken road up to the end is less dramatic than the medaus.
It was from a nine meters wide street, and it is not the talk.
It is currently at 5.50 metres, which is a meter wideer than before," Pöttzl states.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and scholar parking areas in the future will be enjoyed only by students in the high school will not allow Pöttzl to apply.
It will not be parked as it is possible, as in other public parking places, to make it smart.
Remember the People
The Child Crype Mountains, which are on the territory and which would lead the transport to the park cover, should be "not affected by the high-school president."
Moreover, he has to think that this is not just about the kidneys, but also about the people at the invitation to Friedrich-Streb Street and the 800 students of the neighborhood real school.
So it is much more than the particular interests of Mrs Medau," so Pöttzl.
Whether the criticism of the parent office of the children's cripples, with the extent of the street, would have been permitted to lose a "the small natural fleck of Coburg" "the reader can decide himself".
In the beginning of October, Pöttzl, together with the State Buamt Bamberg, wants to inform the town Councils on the constructive development of the High School until 2020, "and in this context, respond to the importance of the new exemption".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's cripples last week about the school plans.
The transportation for the new parking deck will not lead to the campus and the Friedrich-Strub road, but to the Medau-Berg.
To this end, the slight road must be built two-speakly at a mile long.
According to the highest of the Medauss, the verification would make it difficult in the park of Bloss Hohenfels.
About 2000 vehicles daily is the talk.
From the sides of the city, you did not want to speak to the town.
Glandorf returns from handball nationality
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old SG Flensburg-Handewitt led to health problems for this decision.
I don't like the decision, it's been charged for several months.
It's time for me to hear the signals of my body and end my car in the national community," the world master shared on his Facebook page in 2007.
It is therefore with a bi-working of 167 country games and 576 tours for Germany in the international rest.
Because the famous backward player for the Champions-League Seager from Flensburg wants to go to Torwayagd for a few years, he is now not available to the new Bundestra _BAR_ Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Iceland, which held its framework for the country games against Switzerland on Switzerland on Sunday, Glandorf conducted a "long and long talk.
His ideas and adherences have made me a pleasure as they will enjoy my long-term partners and my followers.
But for my club, I also want to be healthy in the next years, there are longer regeneration pauses that do not allow the current double charge.
The left hand had to fear his car end after a fersen infection in 2012.
Because of the problems of Achille's sons, he had been able to treat himself with a Cortison-speak that later had made a strong inflammation.
One note operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the Communitysar, which ended with a comparison.
Twelve years Profi and 11 years of National Management Care is going to pass no body without question.
I have some healthy buildings that I can't ignore anymore.
Following the three infection conditional foot operations that performed in short distances in 2012, I have never received my blood pressure right in the grip.
This is some other deteriorated complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I have noticed that although I control my head, but my body can't hurt," Glandorf in the interview explained the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comback, he would only be prepared in absolute need.
"If all strikes go out, I'm always ready to talk," said the two-fold family father to the pharmacovigilance.
However, I can count on a hand the years in which I can still play a handball.
I must also say that after my long hospital residence in 2012, I have become quite humiliated in my health.
After my car, I want to go at least sometimes right now.
Besides the WM title 2007 and the winning of the Champions League 2014, he received the EHF postal 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
2012, he also assured the European Pokalsiers' pocals with Flensburg.
German economy in the early year approximately 0,2 Pro
The crisis around the globus burned the German economy in the second quarter.
The Brutto-inland product decreased from April to the end of June 2014 in comparison with the prequarters of 0.2 Pro.
This shared the statistical Federal Board, and was providing provisional provisions.
Only the consumption was the economy in the early year, while the investment returned.
In addition to the external trade, the conjuncture broke.
Thanks to the strong annual agreement, for the first half year there was a total of 0.8 Pro against the second half of the year 2013.
Horstmar was the beginning point and the goal of the "Münsterland Mooist", which led the Burgmann city first on Sunday.
The Burgmann City Horstmar experienced a invasion of the Netherlands "Feters" on Sunday.
The largest Radsport band of the Netherlands, N°U, performed the so-called "Münsterland Mooist".
This is the biggest Radtour and the Münsterland, the radiator paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked for their registration in Jos to Huren for the organization of this carrier by the Münsterland.

Furthermore, the road, which was described for three different categories, directed Mrenhouse over the creational mountain towards Coesfeld and Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On streets of 95 km with 1175 height metres, 120 km with 1475 height metres and 145 km with 1775 height metres, the radiators proved their condition.
They were spent on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Major Jos to Huerne and Master Heinz Lölfing showed great pleasure for the success of this Radsport Event.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all participants.
The organization has passed without problems and there were no negative events," Heinz Lölfing is a positive phase of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not so many participants as the prosecutor had hoped, which was confusing on the bad weather forecasts and on the morning rain.
"We'll see us again in 2015 at hopely beautiful weather on 30 August or during another weekend," but the railway drivers will still return to the Munsterland and the prosecutors plan a new position.
Constantin Weckers already unreal memories
It is more philosophical witness than biography, which has brought Constantin Wecker, Liımacher, Pacifist, Political Activist, Ex-Thank, in "Manch and Warriors" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thoughts for thought fats, the Münchner, born on 1 June 1947, wrote low his memories, each chapter started by a singing text.
And he is increasingly honest: from Onanie as a gymnasiast to the loading and consumption, he does not allow human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in relation to his fellowmans.
Width space also includes abstract, but even more important terms: love, soul, ego, his in now, spiritality - all that he tries to go on the basis, in very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also declares his pacifism, his societal criticism, his political commitment - and also, as he did not only the music (the opera lover became the Soul and rock musician) but also his detention.
Lastly, the Lebemann Constantin Wecker also approached the asketic moonch, which comes "with subtraction" as he says, "without all the unnecessary".
Among all the highly spiritistic views, however, there are short anecdotes to the earth: such as rows in one of the GIs frequented local or a driving car, where he designated a tree frontal.
He's not yet honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into my arm.
He never said, "I love you"
Henry was one of the seven children of a jamaican immigrant family in Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, was limited in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry pro.” for a commodity, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on a imaginary conversation with Father and has come from the radio 4 series.
The Sound Track is a mixing of Reggae and Rap, with living melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "much" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with Father.
It was hard to know him.
They never saw his face, but only heard his voice, "Look with the voice.
Let your sister rest.
Move!
I want to look at Cricket.
My elderly brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already wake up when I was a child - went with him into the knife and talked about things like the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket struggle.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner who read the magazine.
Recently Henry opened a gateway in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's days, he won a view of how life could have been for him.
It's now something more, but they're dark, deeply deep labyrinthe with flames and smoke and a lot of rush.
My father just laid in the wanne earlier, and then he was slowly hearing how he began to sing because he was able to wash the kidney from himself.
When I went down there, I realized that he had done that for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect to him became greater.
Nevertheless, Henry grows up as a child without his parents’ love.
My father never hurt me, he never said, "I love you."
Before my mother was bad at the end of her life, we start, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop the "I love you"?
Stop smoking me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still a friend of French who was married 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetes.
That led to her death.
So when I was very, very overweighty and showed symptoms of diabetes, my argue said "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitnessing and had to make a drastic diet to transform the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's an effort.
Nobody wants to eat Carotten.
Henry's Kar's change may be shown in a elegant, short-stretched bar.
Since he was devoted by the critics for his Othello, he was joined by the theater.
It followed the commodity of mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is another experience than the Sitcoms and Comodies who have exercised his business life.
He started with only 16 years when he was in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television cars started in the middle of the seventy years. "I was for a pretty long time of the only black imitator/comedian in the television."
He learned in his profession.
I had not only to grow in the eyes of the public but also to learn how I could become an effective crazy story machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his Manager had the right to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a easy entertainment program in which the people "swarmly joined", Henry took up his comdy over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wanted somehow that it would never be disappointed, but I don't repent I did it.
It was a pleasant, inappropriate position for me, but I was with riesen projects and learned how to handle a large public.
But this "yearly price-grown easily price column of the British TV" was also a "great parody of black people".
Through the introduction of figures that the British Black Culture was as well as celebrated, Henry in the eights of an alternative comic circuit.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went to sending in 1984, and in the nineteen, he was among other than the cuisine head Gareth Blacklock in the comdyserie Chef!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series, and film rolls were pronounced next year, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels like you just take the time or get a little on the place."
Following a documentary for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first follow-up was about Shakespeare.
At Shakespeare, I was regularly allergic.
I had never learned something right about him at school and thought it mainly for a domain of the medium class, white in striphoses and a coal head in front of it.
So I had a big deal before that.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it once.
Don't hurt if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so.
Henry took up 20 lines from Othello's last talk for the documentary movie and he was amazed.
I felt that I could do it.
It was almost like someone had finally put my head right.
"This is why it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, search a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this track for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and it just didn't.
And soon he arose in the commodity of mistakes.
I was suddenly in the National Theater and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinct that he had to talk to the public.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to burn now 10 minutes while they repair the computer."
Instead, the leader announced that the idea had continued, soon as the problem was resolved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for it.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You're playing in a theater piece, so stay in de ́ role."
Henry in Fences in Duchess Theatre
Teaching the text for Fences was responsible.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the sights.
It also came well, so it's like a great shield of the gods who say to me, "This is your destination."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERNENT voice.
So I'm staying there.
I really love that.
I like to be in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is of humorous outbreaks, while he still imitates people again.
I have decided not to stand up-comedy because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction of a room full of foreigners is somehow sensitive.
If you always look for it, you'll move to a wall.
I'm sometimes living in Apollo when I'm pleased, but in total there's not so much to me as before.
I'm asking him if he's going to make a stand up-comedy tour again.
The pleasure I have in a room with a rider that helps to form a beginning, a middle and the end of a travel - I don't think I want to leave it again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I'd like to be a watch player.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.

In the conflict between the Shitish Huthi rebels and the Jemenite Government, Huthis called to civilly disobeyed in Sanaa.

Kenia registered officers to include "Gestors"
Kenia has started to register all state officers biologicly to remove "gest employees" from the government's content lists.
Workers who have not been registered in the next two weeks would not be paid anymore was a government message.
The Government believes that thousands of persons will receive any payments from the public service even after they have been dismissed.
President Uhuru Kenyatta spoke at the Office of the Assembly of 2013 to combat corruption in the public service.
At the beginning of this year, a study was found that at least 1 million dollars (700,000 £) per month were lost by payments for "Gestors" and other misusual financial practices.
The Government believes that containers are continued to be paid on accounts after a person died or leaved the public service, Wanyama Chebus® reports for the BBC from the capital city of Nairobi.

The scandale about the Art Council Helge Achenbach is first negotiated before the court on 11 November.
Five inheritants of Berthold Albrecht, the son of the Aldi-Grønder Theo Albrecht, requested in a civil process at Düsseldorfer Landgericht 19.4 million euro replacement of Achenbach and two of his enterprises in the invention procedures.
This shared a judge on Monday.
In the complaint, Achenbach has contributed to the acquisition of artworks and old hours and Berthold Albrechte is calculated as actually paid purchases.
This has also occurred the agreed provision.
Achenbach has reached 121 million euro values for Alba.
Children need roots and wings
44 years of school, 23 of them as school leader.
Since this time, Manfred Judge knows many standing Petershausenes and Kollbachers from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always attempted to see people in the school.
The snowhead is the most lucky mountain of the riesenberg.
Manfred Judger lies the painting with the motive from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Böhmen, today Trutnov.
With 14 years, he was interested in the University of Teachers after four years.
A year later, the Southern Germans were united.
A half hour the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bayern in 1946 in the car rental.
That's how the judge fell into the over-fresh Senkendorf.
The teacher's training was found in Bamberg.
To that end, Manfred judges had to run six times a week → kilometers to the next train, walking to Bamberg with the train, walking throughout the town to school and evening.
Two months later, Manfred judge in a Red Cross House in Bamberg received a sleeping opportunity: with up to 15 students in a sleeping room.
In 1951, he made the first and after three years of teacher the second state exam.
Since he had no free teacher office for him, he went to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Mrs.-Room" was his first "building" at school.
In 1958, he received a three-room building in the newly built teacher house near the school.
This house bought Manfred Judger 1980 after the school was solved in Kollbach 1968.
There were three classes in Kollbach in the school band Petershausen-Collbach and in Petershausen five.
Since the 1968/69 school, these were collected in Petershausen in today’s race.
When the Indersdorf was founded, only the basic school remained in the place.
In order to escape a turnover in the smaller school now, the director Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred judge became his follower.
However, Petershausen grew up, and thus the children and their teachers were able to relate to today’s building, which was extended after Judge Pension 1997.
Manfred Judger lo日 the uncomplicated movement of the former citizen Ludwig Göttz, who later built a workspace in the community and extended 1997 Cellerspaces, although it was not acceptable in accordance with the Directives for School Building.
"Master of citizens God was very awesome," judged thankful.
In all his car, Manfred Judge never forgot the talk of a Governing representative who had responded to a reference to a school advice on the right and justice: "You should never forget the love." Manfred Judge set out what he heard as a young teacher.
"You must give the children two times: roots and wings," says 84-year-old.
And he had to learn, "It doesn't always." If he only meant his students or his own six children, he's not clear.
In any case, judges were sometimes unconventional.
When students were disappointed, they did not have a punishing work from him, nor were they disappointed to the neighborhood.
On the costs of the community, the judge had made two box hands and allowed the two counters to join each other, even if there should be a box once.
In order to promote the school, judges as a director have a relationship with Master Ludwig Göttz (CSU).
This moved the partialised judge after his pension to candidate at least 1996 in the CSU list for the community.
But the judge was chosen at six places and the CSU attended.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 road carriers put in the Bad Salzausen and Schotten Interstop
When radlers rast on their tour in Bad Salzausen or Schotten, it is nothing to be able to do.
On Friday, however, only the number of rastends made an impression: the 700 participants of the h4-Radtour and with-tross enjoyed a pause in the bottom of Bad Salzhausen cork and later a party under the free heavens in the Schottener Alteburg Park.
Under the Motto "Radels and celebrations on new discovered ways between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and there a concert of Van Baker & Band miterle.
On Friday, it was serious: The Radlers took the first step, 60 km over the city to Bad Salzhausen and further to shots in attack.
In Bad Salzhausen, the sporters of citizens Hans-Peter Seum, who was launched in Bad Vilbel with the road, and the leader of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring, were welcomed.
For refreshing the body and the spirit was prepared for good things: the women from Ranstadt and the Lower Mocktown had 85 lights of apple, Swedish, Stress and Casecuches that were wonderful to the strong radilers.
"So many kitchens can only back farm women," a participant from the alendy bach louded while he ordered another piece.
In the wooden state of the Turn-Nidda Geth-Nidda, cold refrigerations were possible.
The "Duo Bravo" talked with melodies from operates and musicals and enjoyed pleasant applause.
The beautiful environment of the park worked relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a headmassage of his partner: "He has deserved it, and he has re-fested already split road chains today."
For that reason, the citizen master and the business leader had to work: they were interviewed at the source before the drink course of Reporter Ra日 Janke and used the opportunity to get in the Bad Salzhausen radio.
Tobias Hagen also, since the first Hr4-Radtour 2004 as tourist, was able to swim shortly, but he had richly to do with the technology in the place.
His Pickup-track, where he communicated through three phones and a radio device with his employees and the 15-cooked engine-road staff of the police Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants comes from the Rhein-Main-region," he said, "as well, from guests or Fulda, from La'bach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westfales are traveled by raw carriers.
The number of participants is a little after the overnight capacities available.
In category I, the participants are in hotels, in category II in collection subcommunications.
From the Kurort, the radlers had a good impression when they broke again after one half hour: "Thoe!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they cried out.
After the arrival to Schotten, the group could put a short breakdown.
But at evening the radlers were requested in the Idyl Alteburg Park.
Under the region of the Schotten Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS) the park had received a beautiful festival and, of course, it had been prepared for lucky cooks, such as flames with well-coated feet white.
Master Susanne Schaab, GTS Business Leader Markus Hoßfeld and MSC President Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his function as a representative member of the ADAC Hessen-Türingen welcomed them.
The three were probably pleased with the "friendly operation in Schotten".
DJ Tobias Hagen then freed the dance bounds.
Despite the sports certification on the road, the opportunity to be hungryly moved under free heaven has been zealously enjoyed.
Under the guests, citizens continued to be mixed by the good vote as the great crowd of the radar carriers.
On the second day, the railways were held in the program by St. Birstein, Watchbach and Bad Orb, including a concert with the trenkwalders.
Yesterday, after 180 km of Radelns, the sporters returned to Bad Wilbel.
Tuesday of Turkish police arrested for "prohibition" against the Government
At the same time, 33 police were arrested in Turkey because of the decree of the "sworn against the Government" reported local media agencies.
The police officers did not give a direct comment.
Under the prisoners there are 14 high-range police, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were participated in corruption investigations against government workers, including four government ministers in the last December.
In July, a series of Turkish police were arrested because they appeared to have established a organized criminal union and have approved telephone numbers.
The Turkish president Recept Tayyip Erdogan (at that time was Prime Minister) described its action as part of the A's mentioned by the Islamic Church Fethulla G'en against him and other persons in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer vacation.
This day is traditionally a important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenie Jazen, his daughter at school.
There he shared journalists who waited that not all schools had opened again, but he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The week-ends were not held at each school.
The heavens are not peaceful over the Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, a huge Ukrainian peoples front, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Alexan Pastukhow, school leader in Slavjansk, who visited Jazen's daughter, spoke on Russian.
We hope that there will be peace again here and that the children will receive a education that will be useful for them in their lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally trained, where the kids are stumbled, hold ballons in their hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needed.
It includes a proud refrigerator from the banking world, the media management and the internal circle of Tory party.
And she has her own front.
Their cars started with the world management business Bain and Co., and they changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearson media world.
She was the president of the Financial Times for seven years, and she returned when the top post of Pearson's mother firm came to a younger men's colleagues.
It was expected to be almost 1 million £.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was David Cameron by Lord Browne, recommended to the former president of the BP when he searched for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became the cabinet.
Your husband is a former Tory Council member.
In May, I have described the task of the President with a deteriorated chain.
Not only the BBC is as a big and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also a internal paradox in its structure.
Confidentiality works in two directions: inside the first garden of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and disturbance when things run wrong.
This provides a nearly inconsistent duopol, which requires a complete reform.
But which newly coming president would risk to join and become an institution that is so complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he may take his job in itself.
It's a hard job.
And as not enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status.
As the competition is closer and threatening new technologies to old, fair safety, the current negotiation of license fees for the BBC is linked to special provisions.
For the modest amount of 145,50 £ per year, the British public will be purchased into the safe world's largest media undertakings.
The BBC tells a story: she says she reaches 96% of all households and costs only 40 pences per day.
And it seems that the BBC rises on the population scale to the top: 53 Pro’ they are subjected today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The view and use habits for the BBC have changed: I get newslines on my phone and see missing programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very loved and careful institution.
She needed a careful president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says the underlying Tweet was not authorised
A second of the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, received a decreasing observation on Sunday on the Democratic District State advertising, which is at the centre of a criminal accusation against him for the misuse of the officer.
The Tweet was deleted later and replaced by another Perrys User Account, which replaces the previous.
I have just sent a twoth from my account, which was not authorised by me.
"I don't appreciate the Tweet and have deleted it," it said in the later message.
The workers of Perry did not answer immediately on requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perrys of a user account had gone out, it was not clear who actually used the feed.
In the previous twoth, an unprofit image of the district advocate of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, which was condemned in April 2013 for tax beverage.
Perry imposed a Veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to return, which could be a complaint against Perry - the possible presidency candidate 2016 - before a Grand Jury led this month in Austin.
The text of the Tweet says, "I don't always be drinking with the three-fold alcohol level ... but if I do it, I complain about Governor Perry when he explodes it."
I'm the most drunk democracy in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not guided by the investigation of Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special lawyer from San Antonio, chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry is not guilty and the accusation called a political trick.
His High-Classic Team of Legal Affairs requested the judge to reject the accusation and claimed that the law which is being made against the elderly Governor in the history of the Texas State was unconstitutionally diffused.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state money to the Public Integrity Unit of the State - which is located in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to return.
This Veto provoked a public complaint from a left-hand Watchdog group.
Perrys of user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had completed at the election assemblies in Iowa during his presidential agenda 2012 as five, Perry entered the specule that he would stop by posting a secondate of a photo of himself at the jogs near a sea, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains apartments again for "normal"
One of London's prominent builders pointed out that the apartment in South East England was "returned" to normal level.
Private homes in the capital were heavy desires and the subject of great prices, which the Bank of England moved to put the top limits for hypotechnical credits in June because of the widely spread fear of a credit flash.
Tony Pidgley, founder and president of the high-classic building company Berkeley said on Monday, "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the maximum level of 2013" and say that this offers a "stable action environment".
The real estate in London was well placed during the exhaustion, since foreign buyers were forced to go to the capital.
According to the catastrophic information, the prices in the city area only increased by 18,5 pro in the past year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales.
The average sales prices in Berkeley's private, price-values and student offers increased about about a fiveth in the past year and laid out about 423.000 £ in April.
However, in the past months, a stronger pound has made the property of immobility in London for foreign buyers less attractive - some of them have also been scared by the introduction of new immobility taxes and political repositories to a possible "volume tax" before the general elections in the next May.
The London Immobility Macher Foxtons warned last week that the hypotechnical report for April, in which decreased credit provisions were presented, in the second half of the year would also lead to reduced market growth both during the recovery of immobility and prices.
New data from England from Monday show a decrease in the hypothecalyptic authorisation in July, which also indicates that the immobility is cold.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its predict for the increase in the immobility prices in London for 2015 to below to 3 Pro, based on a already weak household price.
The volume of transactions in the closest areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has been returned a quarter for a year, as the Maker WA Ellis.
However, the desire for a home in the main city for Berkeley is a blessing, since the random amounts for date sales are more than 2,2 billion £.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The request for the proper, well-planed product remained stable at the best places and the sales of the date also remained stable as a result."
In June, the company reported that 3,742 new homes had been acquired in the year until the end of April - almost a third of the maximum level of 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax results increased by 40 Pro per year to 280 million £, the turnover of 18 per cent to 1.6 billion £.
In a notification on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the income for Berkeley would expect to match the current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result of 450 million £.
Berkeley's actions were fixed at the afternoon in London trade at 23,96 £.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence occurs at the 85th Oscar delivery.
Nakt photos of Oscar Pricedler Jennifer Lawrence was published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of more 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" assured that the photos of Lawrence were real and claimed the hacker for "eclatant damage of the speech".
The authorities have been informed and will follow all those who continue to post Jennifer Lawrence's photos.
The photos originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan were obtained by an iCloud of Apple online player system. The "masterlist" of the hacking victim includes the names of tens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, though Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I have taken in our private area years ago -- I hope you are so satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonsers "iCarly" and "Victorious" states that it is at the photos about images of her and the second "These so-called naked images of me are GEFÉLSCHT, people.
Let's go to the beginning once.
Buzzfeed reported on Sunday late that a speaker of Popstar Ariana Grande declined from her the reality of the famous photos.
Exclusive outcome from Howard Jacobson's highlighted new Roman about love and the letters "J".
They broke, so they could best describe it, they solved themselves slowly as a carton that was left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, stressing, intense, distant and perhaps something short.
And then shoot his hand.
He was quickly aware of it.
He was ugly like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this poverty was a just starting business that was more promising for a deterioration of the single long time of his life than other, and may even have brought him a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a thirsty beauty with uncovered hairs and a flattering heart from a village on the north island, even remote and rare than the Port Ruben.
She came with an elderly guide to the south that kevern holded for her tits, which had a basic piece in a flat but paradise valley with the name of Paradise Valley.
Over several years, no one had been in the house.
The rohs were nice, in the woods were still spices, naked shoes left their tracks on all windows and believed that they belonged to all these things, and the garden was watched with uncross, which looked like great coal heads.
It was like the house from a childmark, both threatening and disturbing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose roman "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Price 2014.
The score list will be given in the next week.
Kevern had seated with Ailinn at hand on the broken beds in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm breakfast afternoon. Both had been bound spiritually apart into the service console, which provided the country with relaxing music and conscious news when the view of their crossed breuned legs reminded him of an old song of a longly forgotten black entertainer, whom his father was pleased to hear in closed ladies in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their irregular aggressiveness, songs of this kind have no longer been played on the console.
Not prohibited - nothing was so prohibited - just not played.
It was obsoleted, as the word is obsoleted.
The general pleasure made what would never have been done, and as people at books, the Vom-Teller-to-millionary memories, cooking books and love-romanes, they chose the ballades in the music.
In the Euphorie of the day Kevern started playing a imaginary piano and hanging in a grob-comic Serenade Ailinn's big feet.
Ailin didn't understand that.
"This was a song of a jazzpianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
That was what his father always did to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and Father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, as he said.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers on your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game at that time, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew that this was expected by him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn never heard anybody.
Jazz became, even if he wasn't directly banned, not played.
Improvizing was no longer modern.
It was just a place for one "wen" in life.
The people wanted to be absolutely sure where they would end at the beginning of a melodie.
Like the understanding.
His invisibleness made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically outstanding.
Although he was 10 years old without hearing of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz from the half secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn't have to declare Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
In her age, she was probably not able to remind herself of a time in which Popsangers were not black.
Again, no laws or complaints.
A consistent company means that each element of this society was acceptable to the principle of the grouping event - thankful as those who were devoted by the Shick Hall.
People with afro-caribbean origin were suitable through temperament and body building for entertainment and sport, so they sang and broke them.
People originating from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by the nature with electronic talent and were subject to the task to ensure that no family remained without a working service phone.
The rest of the Poland community was concerned about the channel; the rest of the Greeks, Tellers were broken.
Those from the Golf States and the Levants whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country as WAS GESCHEHEN WAR, WENNES GESCHEHEN WAR - from fear of being accused of firefounds, even because of fear that the flames would devote them as the next - had opened Labneh and Shisha's feeding restaurants, remained depressed and were depressed with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she only heard ballades, Ailinn was hard to understand how the wise words that Kevern had just told her could ever be destroyed.
Music was the expression of love.
"They are not really reasonable," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never made anybody, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the disappointed garden gave him the harmful feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the shadow of the big cold sheets.
Ailin doesn't understand yet.
Why should your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he refused to put two fingers back in her present.
She already thought he was something able.
"It seems funny to him," he said instead.
She unbelievingly shot her head and locked Kever's view.
There was nothing to see around the world than your uncovered black hair.
Nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say it," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're going to do it to me.
She looked really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked back.
Your feet's not so straight.
Maybe your knock, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my bones are too thick?
You hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early.
"Your deep bones are exactly the reason why I like you," he tried it instead.
I'm a little pervers there.
That didn't sound right.
It's supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often felt in difficulties because he as his father did not disappoint his charm that was needed to take into account the inherent greed.
Maybe his father wanted to be greedy too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomon's became red and rose up from his chair, threw the console, and cut off the wine they had drinked.
Holunderflower wine, so drinking was not a excuse for him.
In their consciousness, they seemed to be stumbled like a palm weapon in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly why I feel pervers to you," she said...
Except that I'm not.
She regreted him, both because of the unnecessary unnecessaryness of his words and the fear that she had shown in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he'd hurt her?
She didn't tell him about life on the cold northern archipel where she was wake up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like this.
The same big and cold ocean is here as the coast.
The same confusioned men, with even more thicker skin and more disgraceful after DEM WAS GESCHEHEN WAR when their forefathers were as smugglers and strangers, always ready to lift up the hand against a woman who refused or hurt them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a thief if she didn't watch!
She's just kissing - Knotskin was the most common word used for a erotic attraction force between men and women, an opposite to the unseen loving ballades from the console - they're just kissing and then hit.
Keverns viewed that it was an unnecessary defence, since the nodeman himself was a act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon gave him a sign through her body.
He arose out of the chair as an old man.
She also felt persistent, but the wound of her grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They didn't know.
She looked at him as he was away - as from a room in the top stone she had her companion with him - a man, complained by something that he himself had bound up.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt suddenly pain for him and men generally, although some had lifted up their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, mocked his back, wounded, wounded, without fighting spirit - why was that a view that she seemed to know well if she couldn't remember once when she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomon's feet.
A few years before the stated events, Esme Nussbaum, a intelligent and pleasant 32-year researcher in Ofnow's mandate, the non-legislative supervisory body for the public vote, in a short report on the continuous violence at low and medium-level level in the parts where their decrease, unless the derogation, was expected, was mostly expected, in view of the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has already been done a lot, and many have to be done," she wrote, "to emphasize the native aggressiveness of a people that led thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet spirit of human friendship has seen historically despite the highly questioned church tours between the heavy.
But some characteristics seem to be inevitable.
As the Church Tour, it seems to be less than the suffering he continues to wake up.
The population weeps when hearing emotional ballades, based on stories about overwhelmed difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the ancestors of marriage and family life, but not only the former silence holds the rural communities as our stated associations in the hand, but there are also evidence for the establishment of a new and sustainable conflict at home, on the workplace, on the streets and even on the game fields.
"You have an unfortunate trend to overcome," her mentor said when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less Romans.
It's Nuss Tree, that's what she's heading down.
I also have to ask, are you atheist?
"I think I don't have to say that," Esme said Nusswood.
Are you lesbic?
Repeat asme on her right to the point of view and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Re-moving.
"I don't ask this," said Luther Rabinowitz s日, "for I would be against atheism, lesence or feminism.
This is a prejudiceless workspace.
We serve a free prejudice society.
But some kinds of hyperactivity that are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy can sometimes deteriorate results as you have presented them.
They have obviously prejudices against the Church, and these things that you consider as "relevant" and "roh" could be interpreted by others as well as the expression of natural power and vitality.
If you continue on the road, WHAT GESCHEHEN IS, WENN ES GESCHEHEN IS, as if it had happened yesterday, it means to take the country its essential life force.
That nuss tree looked around while Rabinowitz was talking.
The back of the head repeated a LED strip in Flamingorosa the advice that Ofnow had granted to the country in the last four hundred or longer.
If you laugh at your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to ballades, visit Musicals, use your phone, speak, declare, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than weakness, the song word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely, you want out," Esme Nusswood answered with a stronger voice when she was sure that her representative had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not so effectively healed as we form ourselves.
My anxiety is that we may reveal, without warning, how to repeat the mistake, which at the same time leaded to WHEN GESCHEHEN IST.
This time, however, it is not the other in whom we release our anger and our disbelieving.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramide with his hands.
To explain an English patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "if you're taking action as "errors" that may have done our grandfathers or not.
They also go too far if you talk about that they would have released their "wound" and their "misleading" to "other".
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past such as the protection of the present, we speak not of "us" and "other".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of injustice, that's all we know.
"When we are honest to ourselves," Esme waited to throw in, "no part of the society can claim to be a good behavior.
I'm not complaining anyone.
Whether it has been bad or good done what happened, it has happened.
That was at that time.
It must not be said anymore -- we agree.
And just as no guilt has to be assigned, no guilt must be denied if such an offence was suitable and if there is a way to touch them.
But what does the past serve if we do not learn from it?
The past serves that we forget them.
If I can say something about it...
Luther Rabinowitz left his pyramides together.
"I'll think of her report," he said and decided.
The next day, when she went to work as habitually, she was transferred by a motor radar driver, who, as passengers described, was driven into a kind of "brutal wrath" on the road.
There's a case.
Lesotho Military member says that no Statestrip has been planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military officer in Lesotho dispute to have planned a state strategy to the government and said that they had committed against cops whose weapons will be predicted by political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and told that the army of the country surrounded his office and had occupied government buildings in the Major city of Maseru.
The Prime Minister held his family in the southern South Africa after reporting about the threats of the attent.
Military speaker Ntle Ntoi said that there was de facto no state, but the military reacts to the threat by "political fanatics" whose weapons were proposed by the police.
"What happened to the morning that the staff of defense forces of Lesotho acted after he received several secret reports that some elements were acting within the police, which really wanted to weapons some of the political, part-political young fanatics, which were shortly before it, were devastating damage," he said to the Voice of America.
The South African Government Speaker Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a disturbance.
"And if no one claims to have taken the government by violence, all reports agree that the A's defence forces of Lesotho show signs for a state street," he said.
Speakers of the military of Lesotho shared on Sunday that the soldiers would go back to their cashers and the situation in the capital was safe.
Meanwhile, Vicepremier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government management during Thaban's absent.
Thabane shared that he believed he became a target for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there were great challenges since June, after Thabane has exposed Parliamental meetings due to the debates in his unity government.
He said that his actions would have not been unfinished by the government, otherwise pronounced accusations against despair.
Production in the euro zone on a 13-month depth
The increase in production in the euro zone was slow to the lowest point of the last 13 months in August, as a precise observation.
The final market of the acquisition manager index (PMI) came to 50.7 in August, after a position of 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 indicates an extension.
New contracts returned and factories experienced injury in a period of growing spending between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The numbers shall take place before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets are expected by the Bank a clear plan for dealing with a long-term recovery of the euro zone and for the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is a spectacle that the ECB's leader, Mario Draghi, could make further information during this week if he considers a quantitative facilitation for the euro zone, according to those adopted by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than any growth, the breaching effects of continuing economic and geopolitical insecurity have become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist on the market.
The factory MMI for Germany, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, fell to the deepest position in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the block, France, the SME was 46.9.
France remains an anxiety child, as well as the decline of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
The indication that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism of Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are also not reassuring," Mr Dobson said.
The decrease of the industry is proud of the fire of the analysts expecting other monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the SME increased to 57.3 and the maximum level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, leader expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say about the index of the acquisition manager in the Eurozone from August is that the sector continues."
He adds: "Products in the euro zone are evidently very difficult now, since the current geopolitical stress - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - insecurity in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These enhanced incertainties have clearly affected the economy - particularly, and the confidence of consumers, and have probably caused some contracts to be delayed or even deteriorated, especially great contracts.
He said that it would be "always more likely" that the ECB should introduce a kind of QE, "although we believe that this will be limited."
The Year of the survivors of the Year: Ten years have passed since the horrible population of the school, as children are still suffering in it today.
Age ago, more than 1,000 people from Czechical Milises were taken into a school in South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than the help of their children, were killed in the three-day martyry that the world shocked.
We are returned to ́lan to find some of the victims who had been killed at the wrath in the class room.
Exactly a year after the deceasing investment of the school of 334 people died, including 186 children, warned the heavy survivors last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As a fanatic islamic terrorist children and parents, on 1 September 2004, captured and killed, it seemed to be the worst of the wicked.
The tragedy united West and East into Abscheu, and then surprisedly turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst tribulation.
Ten years later, we returned after ́lan to find some of the victims that were killed at the wrath in the class room.
We found surprising young people who have overcome oppositions, although the memory of this terrorist haughty will be persecuted forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that now visits Ukraine - and in the kids like they die -- now finds an end.
The girl that was photographed at the trial to get back to the shooted school sportshall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian Star Photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she only tried to re-shoot school sports chamber after a mine was exploded.
VVIIG confused Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at that time.
My legs were bloody.
I stood up and came back in to search for my mother.
A soldier made her safe.
After a series of operations, she felt completely healed, but she said yesterday, "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I have to be operated again.
Some granates are still in my knee.
Your goal is now to become teeth doctor to help people as helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she warrily said.
"It's me, and that can't be changed.
Once a year, I'm always going to the sportshalls to remind me of those who stay there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmates Dzera Gapoeva were killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamed to go to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I end my room and start my car.
I think of a family later.
She says that the investment will always remain part of it, although the memory will be weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the United Kingdom and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself online, I think many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophes, and that something that doesn't happen again.
The boy who fled through the balls, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first school day (Russians go to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day belief in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mammy said to me, I should take myself when there's an explosion, and keep her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Return."
Complerly, she could be dead, he fled and saw a weeping little child on the way, took it in his hand and fled through a bowl.
His father Wladimir, who put his son in his arms outside, said, "It told me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was killed outside and injured in the hospital, in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reconciliation, she said, "I wept for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and wrapped me.
There was later logs to London (from the intermediate news of the world) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from the former Premier Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop the admonition," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's gonna be blurring in my memory.
I'm still aware that I've removed all my game guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shoots and that is not a problem for me.
"I don't have to go back to the sportshall, but I don't think of myself.
I remember those kids with whom I played in the court and who did not get it outside.
We never say they were killed or they're dead.
We're saying they're staying in the sportshall.
I remember very well my journey to London, especially on the game load, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the journey in a open car above.
But now he has a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of disaster that he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wanted to stop reminding me of it.
"I'm so sorry for all those suffering among the abominations," said Da, last week as volunteers in a closter.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police on one day and hope that they will take me at the school age next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the horrible silence after the campaign, there was just no children who could call and run, and this silence took many months.
She feels lively about her travel to London with Da.
The people in London wept when I told our story.
At that time, I understand how people can understand our feelings on the other hand of the world and show their support.
She was Cherie Blair and her foundation thankful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the midst of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember her and her husband in London, and how Da and me helped.
I still remember how Da would like to eat Burschtsch and call all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with cells in an aurant, so he shot with his water pistole on them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't been better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I think many children have been killed and are still killed.
That's exactly the kind of children like ours.
I think for many of the war is a part of the news they hear when they are lucky or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Because it has become big and is a very mild and mild boy, he is not agressive or whilst aggressive.
For example, he is not looking for race, he is not overwhelmed by the past wraths.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the sportshalls and burn there Christmas.
When he was smaller, he was lower - I remember how sometimes he laid on the sofa, the face turned away from us for hours.
No sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he continued to throw all his weapons and other military games. There is now 17, greater than I, good looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can't think I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came on my legs, I looked around, and I looked around, with parts of the body around me.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have been unable to overcome in this hole.
"I remember that I called him, "They, run, run," but I was also so sure he didn't hear me.
But he has heard it and he's gone.
And that's how life goes, other than many other things, for us.
Georgian Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrible image after the place has become the symbol of the wrath of ́lan
Reconfort: The survivor of Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the campaign 2004, right a picture of Georgia today
His blood-transplanted face was attempted when he divorced his life while the Czech terrorists shot his classmates down.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbary of ́lan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had stopped him for his first school day before she left to bring her older son Wladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists struck him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not alone, there was a whole family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia was able to survive.
As closer to this date, it is more difficult to think about it and talk about it.
There is no one day in which we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time ago, I mean, it'd happen yesterday, some scenes of these days follow me forever.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intriguing: The image of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was distorted as statue (right).
I remember that Georgia wanted to go to school this day, and he said he wanted to kill his teacher.
I just knew he was alive when I saw him in television.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgia doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden with us at home in the book regulal.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world through this picture feel our pain.
Georgia says today, "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt we've ever learned the truth.
People always examine such tragedies again and never know the truth.
And now they examine the disturbance of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused him?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, for if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how is this happening?
Ten years have nothing to do with such pain.
We need tens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
About three or four years I had some album dreams because of the investment, but then it became better.
Later, in 2004, I went back to school and had every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I'm always going to the sportshalls when I'm closer to 1 September.
I want to pay my old childhood tribut.
It's hard for me to go to the sportshall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I'm not going to forget, but I'm not insulting.
My life goes on.
I completed the school this year and visited a medical school in Wladikawkaz.
I'll be a heartchirurg.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgian Faniew, 20
The boy who survived, although he was captured to the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgia Faniew was captured during the campsite to the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he was able to survive.
He was captured in the sportshall and sat near the bomb, established at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a wonder that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgia, who wanted to go to FSB as a secret service, but this could not be done because of his healthy damage because of the investment.
It's still with me, there's nothing I left behind.
I'm now older and people say that children can easily handle bad experiences -- I need to say that's not true.
"2006 I'm with psychologists, and then I really felt something better, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the sportshall.
I lost my conscience.
I will never return therein again and ask me not to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgia Faniew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the laptop
My pain is awesome, and I bring him with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think of it or talk about it, and they never asked me for school.
I'm all right in my body.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I could not study the secret service academy of the FSB in Sankt Petersburg, as I wanted.
I checked my documents, including the medicals, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second suffering was the animals, so I went to the animal institution.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to goats".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about it, and they should not, of course, be lied to it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is closer.
I'll go to the Memorial Festivals.
I know Georgia won't go.
It must be much more awesome for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me.
It's staying in us.
Georgia is now a wake up, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept it if someone accepts something so unfair.
He's a boy who loves sport, but he can't share knees because.
He's been operated several times, he can run, but he doesn't work sport.
I would say he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Friends and neighbors were killed in the campaign and that only strengthens my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and they were awesome to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could do to me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It is difficult to accept that life continues even if you don't want it.
I will never forget how my heart sprang in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what happens in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can't almost believe it.
We were a friendly country before, how can it be that we were fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and have been killed.
If all of us could take these rebellion and cast out - as far as possible.
Allon Tschajeva, 10
The baby that was so appreciated by a special intervention command
Reserved: Aljona Tskajewa is made secure by a Russian special set command (left).
It is now ≥ (right) and does not refer to the severity.
The world stopped the breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was held in the arms of a Russian police officer from the campaign of Alaska.
The terrorists let them go, but in their grossness they kept their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Christina and her brother Makhar at school sportshall.
Makhar, then three years old, disappeared, but Aljona’s mother and sister died in the murderous murder.
Her father Russlan has married again and has made his new wife Swetlana a little girl who called Christina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, today's age, doesn't refer to the building and is raised to a smart and happy girl, say neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," said a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the reminders that come up with the eighth anniversary.
You'll understand why.

Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, declines the accusation from Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set up the procedure for January.
4 Tips for better subwater photos and videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most precious option is a water-deep point and shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or a action chamber such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver edition, both to have for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras all available at a price of under $350.
About the equipment there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a water-deep camera, make sure the battery and other fabrics have been closely closed.
Set your camera too on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and Camcorders have scene and record modes that optimize the exposure time for the dark subwater conditions.
And before you walk in, check how deep your equipment is functionable.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, other than 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our purchases and evaluations for digital cameras for natural and water-depth models.
Make multiple records - because many don't go back.
Point-and-shoot cameras have a LCD with which you can compose images, not usually action-cams.
Even if you have a LCD, it's hard to watch this under water, and the right image configuration is a happiness case.
So you make a lot of records.
If your camera is running through a row mode that makes a series of records with easily modified exposure settings, use it.
Keep near the surface.
The light will be dramaticly worse, as you continue to remove from the upper area.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface if you make records in a pool, a sea or sea.
You can also bring more colours into your photos; if you go deeper, less colour you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on the country, but it is more important under water because of bad light conditions.
It is especially important if you work with an action-cam: These devices often have a fixed witch line, which means that you need to draw closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire image frames.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changes things, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As a adviser of anesthesis, he dedicated his car to the task to save both the disease agonia and the quality of the treatment.
In his patients, as mentioned in his wife, he was a MI6-cooperator who had to live with the devastating effects of foltering.
Lawson knew that diagnosis and diseases are important to the doctors, while the treatments are mainly occupied with something else: pain.
On one day in 2007, however, he was the one who had suffered.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulties to get up.
As he struggled with the similar symptoms, he noted that he made his wife Juliet intolerance.
"I want everything better than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business travel for a week, Lawson felt unusual and unfair.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to have an investigation of his breast.
Just two weeks ago, he was in the French Alpen.
The result of the Röntgen investigation occurred.
He suffered Mesotheliom, an unhealthy cancer, who attacked the brushfell, so that he attacked the skin translating the lungs.
Like most cancer diseases, the precise solution is most difficult to determine.
For example, for example, some smokers are ill at long cancer, not all long cancer diseases have been early smoking.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the exposer is a asbest charge - contact with the fascinating substance, which, once as a "wonderful substance" has been recognised as mortal.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbest is a product of the past.
The most annual asbest type has not been used in Britain since the 1960s since the industry was voluntaryly binding to not use it anymore.
Moreover, where he was still used, only people in certain branches are directly with the substance - clempner, building workers, rooms and advertising workers, for example.
As a industrial substance from another time, it seems to be a little worried today.
But this self-compliance is uncomfortable.
Great Britain seems to take up today the top point of a mesolthelium epidemia.
There are more deaths through Mesotheliom here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2.500 deaths per year, so many people die in this illness as in accidents of injury.
Annual numbers of cases of Mesotheliom death since 1980 and future deaths in Britain
The reason why we have experienced the death effects now, although asbest has been illegal for years (1999 all asbest types were prohibited) is that a Mesotheliom has developed only after year.
And the grass of Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers of the building industry.
Asbest was, and there is still, often, in the houses in which we live, the office in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the business in which we purchase.
So Mesotheliom does not know class diseases, financial limits, professionals or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant purchases in London to school, are not a protective room.
The Parliament's buildings are as best asking.
Moreover, in the hospitals where we are to be healthy, we have already been exhibited as a shepherd of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a crazy man.
In fact, he was hard to imagine where he might have been contacted with asbest.
Then he found out.
"It seems like in the tunnels at Guy's hospital, where I decided my training for six years, there was a lot of asbest." He wrote.
All - students, nurse sisters, doctors and Pfortners - use the tunnel.
You wonder how many of my elderly companions will suffer in the same illness?
Unfortunately, he could be answered at least partly.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's hospital and who were sick at Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I'm the last who still is still le."
How many of us will be ill?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was increased in 48 years of age.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It was an unusual long survival.
Fifty Pro* all mesothelio markers die within 8 months after diagnosis.
The illness always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us will still be sick?"
The leading British expert to Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbest epidemic in Britain is expected to come to expire, a total of 90,000 of the illness will be victim.
Most of them have no idea that they will die so.

A short core on the acts of the courts to which the persons concerned often turn to because of damage replacement requirements shows how far the hazard of Mesotheliom has already been spread.
In June this year Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted Janice Allen to have exhausted asbest.
She had nine years for the chat, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing division at two places - one of the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when they started their activities in M&S.
Now she has two children in the twenty.
"Before this thing," she said, "I never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even know anything about asbest.
I'd never thought it would be about me once.
There are only few people who know much about asbest.
The fact is that the term Asbest is not a substance but a group of six minerals.
The name refers to the word "asbestiform", a description of the fabric structure that makes the substance resistable and flexible.
Three of the six were used in building.
Chrysotil, even as a white asbest, is now the most common asbest found in buildings.
It was used for dach disks, footplates, rockrisols, boilerizations, even for breaming stocks in cars.
It is less mortal than other asbest forms, however, the EU and the WHO are viewed as the "great health risk" of death.
However, more dangerous is the brune asbest (Amosit) and the blue asbest (Krokydolith).
The United Kingdom was one of the world's biggest importers of brain asbest, and experts believed that "the clear, but indirect evidence that this was a key reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliom rates."

Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliom sacrifice, but the work of Julian Peto indicates that their history is never unusual.
He has presented a series of those concerned in which it is shown that "a significant part of the mesotheliome has been caused by an asbest contact in the environment without any exhaustion by work or in the house."
A majority of these contacts is based on its statement on the "normal use and age" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can go out of it to be safe.
A report of Goddard Consulting, who has examined the Westminster Palast, shows how people could have been exposed to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009 Goddard reported that the services and road guides behind Parliament's committees were tried with asbest, whose mortal races were able to be exhausted by something like "stark air movements".
Members of the Parliament are often accused to take care of their own interests, but this looks like the opposite.
Since the Parliamentary Working Service Directory had found that the Westminster Palace had received a "super health certificate", it is inevitable that 1 billion £ workshops should be established for several years in order to renew the Parliament, modernize the electronic installation and remove the asbest, and that, after the general elections of 2015, the deputy will be better met in the nearby QE2 conference than on the Green Links in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the existance of asbest was not held in accordance with the respective provisions".
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is waiting.
A person who could never determine the contact with asbest is Graham Abbott, a general medicine.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old abbott believes that he was exposed to the asbest during his work in hospitals.
"I have been in a hospital, in which asbest complaint was positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places in which you have been held, and the data.
What he still remembers is the beginning of December 2009, when he received such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he just took a operation late night.
I suddenly had a shot-frist.
It came quite suddenly.
I felt terrified.
I thought it wasn't going home anymore.
As Ar, abbott knew that the pain of the brushfell, the skin touched his lungs around.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to assume a mesotheliom.
He didn't work for a month.
Admired physicians made his breathing records and placed Pleurakat either to take liquid from the lungs and test in the lab.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after sports and heavy breath.
2011, a patient came with similar symptoms in his practice and was later distracted with Mesothelium.
But also now Abbott does not connect this with its own case.
His patient was a few years old and had directly been with asbest.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's status was renewed, and his householder's CT scans and röntgen records to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after the abbott had felt sick for the first time, a sond with a camera was introduced into the cow between the rip and the brustfell.
I'm a optimist.
I'm simply doing what I'm doing," he says.
Honestly, I didn't worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsie was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "Man told me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Mesothelium diagnosis
Successfully, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan sisters, from which one recommended him to take a lawyer.
First, he understands the amount of epidemia.
"Asbest was very widespread, especially in large public buildings in which Rohre often was isolated with asbest," he said.
The people who were exposed to the asbest in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesotheliom now met younger people who haven't been in typical vocations.
The most annual raw with asbests in hospital homes was under the ground, so patients were probably not exhausted with the substance.
But many employees who changed from a building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or underground cantins (as Graham Abbott often did) came with greater probability in contact with the toxic substances.
There is evidence that over several years after the war hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-free for the doctors treating.
He's going to be removed too today.
Schools deployed their bassen burners on asbestmates.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, businesses, libraries and city halls due to his fabelous isolating and flaming features.
In addition to schools.
In fact, many people have had the first asbest contact in the class room.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemicals, students have put their bones on asbestmates.
On web pages, the theme Asbest is now often invited in schools.
And therefore, such innocent objects in our homes have contained asbest standardly asbest, as well as footplates or shoppings.
"It is a industrial gift that contains in large parts of our real estate," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer, who represented Andrew Lawson in the process against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact that included a woman concerned was the abrise of a garden sheep in the 1970s.
So take care of how you broke your garden shoes.
The effects of diagnosis, and that disease is unhealthy, is incredible.
"It takes a while to process it," Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I noticed that I couldn't be able to do what I did.
I was two weeks in the practice.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not gonna experience any other Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspective change was from the position of a doctor to the patient.
As many patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to make.
"It was very hard to get all up," he said.
"I asked my Ar" how long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Yes, I'm not going to experience any other Christmas Festival.
That was then."
Mesotheliom is particularly awesome because it is our life-reserving mechanism - the breathing itself - is that the dead cancer causes.
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbest contact.
Asbest consists of smaller fascinations.
When the asbest is inhaled and the fascinations are inhaled, they can be fixed in the breastfell, the skin around the lungs.
Asbest fascinators irritate the breastfell and can solve cell muta.
"The problem arises with the inhaled inhaled nitrogen asbest fascicles," so Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax-Ar, who changed to Guy's hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital from which Andrew Lawson thinks it has exposed him to the asbest is now ironic, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some other who were probably exposed to the asbest during their training in the hospital.
When the asbestnadels reach the lung weight, the treasure says, "the breathing process will be held to the border where the skin is.
From nature it is from the beginning to invasive.
The usual options in other cancer diseases do not work so well in Mesotheliom.
For example, the efficiency of a operation is heavy.
Some think she's worth a trial.
The treasure denys it.
"You can't cut the bridge out," he says.
They're not coming around with the ass.
Because the cancer says "on chemotherapy not very well," the "work shows", but doesn't heal.
"There's sometimes a long-term survival," says the treasure.
But finally, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live longer, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and half years after his own diagnosis Graham still fights Abbott.
After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a single-man undertakings and advice office for fellow members.
"Hello, cancer center," he replied happy when calling.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years ago and was still very active.
Originally, abbott has been offered six chemotherapy cycles that will last four months and expect to extend his life only for a month.
"I was discouraged," he said.
I wanted to leave.
But Lawson could "lay things in a little more positive light."
After advice of several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart-Thorax specialist at Guy's guy.
"We had an advantage that I had not to be rejected, I just called and received a date," Graham admits.
A normal patient should receive a transmission and wait for the authorisation of the treatment.
The money is decisive for Mesotheliom diseases to be able to experience the best available therapies.
But if these treatments fail unrepentantly, many people are concerned about another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave.
And thus they turn to the judges in the hope of repayment.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse.
"It's since 1898 that asbest is extremely annual for health," Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very small burden was a health risk.
And here the sequence of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital contributed to their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "complimentary compensation" because Lawson was not able to prove absolutely that his Mesotheliom was returned to a asbest contact at Guy's guy.
However, after the investigation of death, a speaker of Guy's experienced that "the asbest fascinators in the area concerned were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbest can be removed
In fact, for Mesotheliom diseases who strive to deteriorate, it is a huge problem to organize the mortal asbest contact of a company or a workplace -- usually a year after the events.
Their former employees have been cut off or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who refuse to dispute know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the complainants.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for those concerned Mezotheliom to complain about a deficiency, even though their former employees were not to find anymore.
The law has established a 350 million £ fund promoted by the insurance industry for all who have been established after July 2012 can prove a contact, but no one can complain.
In these cases, the complainant 80% of what a court in a normal damage process could have been charged with them - approximately 120,000 £.
Approximately 300 requests for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom people that 350 million £ represented a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a share of insurers for insurers," he said, "and it states that this sum is a quarter of what the insurers had to have done if the time hadn't passed over and the Mesotheliom diseases could find the companies and they could normally complain.
In addition, Mike Penning, then Minister for Work and Pension, said that the law was "not perfect".
But both the penning and Morgan indicated that in view of seven death victims every day, a quick action was needed.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelium Act in December of the past year.
At that time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Long Lazdunski recommended a operation from which he expected a positive effect, in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by a radial and chemotherapy - a three-fold treatment with the long Lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years from up to 40%.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"It's of course with the most important," says Abbott.
You always see that again in patients.
There's something that allows you to continue.
If you're leaving, you're going to be far worse.
Graham Abbott undertaken the operation in March 2012.
Finally, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Nesorgescans showed no signs of illness.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer areas around my breast.
I just got 50.
That's not life threatening.
That's life-end.
Abbott was again undergoing six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no more track of the tumor is visible.
But the process is physical and mentally very stressing.
You must think of practical things - about the money if I'm not anymore, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setup works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents it's hard," he says.
It is difficult to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl I had a illness with which I wouldn't be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very awesome and irrelevant.
She told her friends and we got a lot of calls soon.
Ellie was keeping back.
She didn't say much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients need to cross.
But for memothelious markers such talks are not of hope, not of a trace of hope to survive.
The illness (as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) brings angry security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not living threatening.
Body of balanced Pharaoh's bodies in asbest clothing
Asbest fascinations used to strengthen cooking powders and to increase the heat stability.
Plinius of the elder describes asbest.
It was developed a weight that is not burnable.
I've seen sergeants at the festivals in the rocks.
The use of modern commercial asbest begins in Italy, where it is used to produce paper (a.k.a. money) and substance.
Important asbestmins are opened in Canada and South Africa and then shortly in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal isolation substance for the dampf machines and turbines of the industrial revolution.
The global asbest production increases more than 30,000 tons per year.
Statistics of Prudential identify an early death rate in those who work with asbest, which will no longer receive life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw is in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke says that asbest parts in the Lunge "without any reasonable doubt are the main causes of death".
This is the first case of this kind.
Kershaws worker, Turner Bros Asbestos, does not take charge.
It will not be paid to the damage.
In the second world war, intensive ships are built, one of the most deadly places with asbest contact.
Voluntary delay of the branch on imports of blue asbest
The first person's replacement claims in Britain for contact with asbest.
The global asbest production increases more than 4.213.000 tonnes per year.
British imports 139.000 tonnes.
A health and security secutive in Britain obligations all companies working with asbest to purchase license.
The imports and use of blue and bread asbest are legally prohibited in Britain.
Any use of asbest is prohibited in the United Kingdom.
The Mesothelium law is predicted in Britain.
An estimated programme of 350 million £ is announced.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but white asbest is still used as a price-valuable building material in many countries of the earth.
The worldwide production is about 2 million tonnes a year.
China refuses Hong Kong right to government choice, demonstrants swearing payment
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament disappeared despite the increased call for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the elections of 2017 by the Hong Kong election.
This procedure probably confirms the long announced protests in Hong Kong, while the activists led the planning and mobilization within few hours after confidentialisation.
The decision of the Chinese Popular Congress allows communist leaders to reject all non-peking faithful candidates.
"This does not come unexpectedly, but it makes us woe," said legal expert Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking promised.
You enjoined the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritary regime.
In its defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vicegenary Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the authorisation of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong Government would be "chaotical".
Since 1997, when Britain returned the control over Hong Kong to the Chinese, Peking has promised the people to choose the government president since 2017.
The Chinese leader presented the decision from Sunday as a democratic break because there is a direct choice right to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also indicates that the Chinese leadership holds the exit in hand by a closely controlled Nomination Court of Peking.
In addition, after a new clause, only candidates should be allowed "with love for land and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the most active and public protests in Hong Kong have been located for several years.
After the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizations have threatened to shoot the finance if Peking does not allow real general choice right.
On Sunday, hundreds of Occupy Central Attachers were gathered in the rain before the Governing Chairperson in Hong Kong within few hours after the survey.
In the demonstration, the organizations said that their movement has reached a new level of civils in obedience and that they plant protests in the next weeks.
However, they did not make any more information to avoid problems with the authorities.
In a online communication, the organizations shared that the movement "the occupation of the central district has only been considered as the last resources, a action that will only be able to find place when all Dialogue Chances are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all dialogue opportunities have been created and that the occupation of the central district will be definitively located.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been prepared for the Peking announcement for days, and they have strengthened security measures on Sunday before the Government building. Police forces and Barrikades.
The insults are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their city.
The acquisition of people from the continent strengthens competition for products and services.
The fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom, begin to break under the growing pressure of Pekings.
Some criticized the demonstration of the Occupy Central Motion, since they criticized the businessmanagement - the live seed of Hong Kong.
"The protests of which they are talking about could cause great economic damage, after how many have been shared in it and how long they are going," said legal expert Regine Ip, which has criticized the movement since a long time.
We don't want to threaten that Hong Kong will be protected without control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The stately controlled Chinese media have also recently reported the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents charged by western powers.
In this summer, activists organized an inoffensive reference to election rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than one fifth of the electors in Hong Kong.
In July, ten thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school closing sites in the United States is now going to the universities, where Freshmen events are offered with the aircraft.
We are pleased to respond to this question and to offer the first luxeous travel service of Britain for students today.
To achieve a particularly impressive approach at the University, the company also offers transport options such as flights, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also announced that the service had a security party.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who, elsewhere, need to cut their happiness in an annual car transferred by the country.
Along with our new VIF options, we are pleased to ensure that students have the University with a minimum approach and a maximum of Luxus.
A company speaker said that there were no new bookings yet, since the service was just introduced, but that "Studiers would book the service in the next week".
The company also reported that, despite the taxes of 9.000 £ per year, it expected a market for this boat.
Students today are very different in their expectations and expectations from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can exactly do it.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as rejected.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for High School, said: "This boat seems to be completely disturbed from the life of the majority of students.
Students starting this month with the course of life seem to be a crisis of living costs, since the available financial aids in the form of credits and pensions are not taking a strong step in accounts for the most simple life basis before they can at all think of giving thousands of pounds for something simple like the arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behavior in Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants lifted up their hands into the air and sang, "Hand up, don't shoot," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez observed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators will set the sex before the race when it comes to speak reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while the spending in the Middle Western increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women were about 100%.
In comparison with the answers of black women shortly after the shoots of August 9, the personal exays came relatively late with titles such as "The thoughts of Ferguson from a white woman" and "Feminism is not only about the pressure of women".
But for Perez, that means a significant change.
"I don't believe that in feminism there are many people who are over white and speak privileges in such a high classic way," she said.
People felt forced to express something about the events.
It is characteristic for the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they must express it.
For the English Professor Coritha Mitchell from the Ohio State, Ferguson held problems in light, which are exposed to black Americans every day, but which are not considered as "family theme" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something fun on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 Likes from everywhere," Mitchell said.
If I put something on how colorful is in his own country under the places, the weight is earnestly fashioning.
"How can it be certain for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public room?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, the race, sex and sexuality studied in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and sex problems.
For them black women did not have the Luxus to separate the subjects clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
White women now connect the subjects of race and sex in the feminist streams, says Angela Hattery, Professor for Women and Sex Research at George Mason, that their predecessors did the opposite.
" between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were blinded and the reasoning was almost always the administration of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be shared in the history to justifie the murder of Lynch.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came on the point where the white warfare for women's choice right such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for the right could only be a group for each of them: women or blazers.
"They took the decision to take use of women's election rights, and the rights for pregnants should come later," said Hattery.
If you remember such things, a person with power will know why colorful women don't trust white women.
We didn't do our job good.
We have never helped black women to bear their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the election right in 1920, it was still a year until white women were organized against the linch in the Propertyation of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flow of white feminist reactions to the questions opened by Ferguson - Police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "fishing" with the problems with which black women have seen from generation.
"Will it not be great if the activists who have the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to receipt control?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who have built their cars on the fight for reproductive rights and the access to prevent the receipt of resources now try to understand what that means.
The white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article of Rebecca Carroll, the Columnist of Guardian, in which she requested more protests from white Americans to the theme of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand one resident to the body - and opinions on the race that are clearly different in public issues - the changes will be made," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem for an easily intersectional feminism, in which race-like gender theme is invoked, some of their comments on race theme in America have been confused.
Christina Sommers, researcher at American Enterprise Institutes and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, "is far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their former criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently a small program, My Brother's Keeper, set up to help vulnerable young black and Spanish men, there were terrible reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police with the black Community is not the only problem that requires the front of the streamfeminism.
After the United States Greenhouse Police has reached almost 63,000 younger years in the southern west border of the country in this year, the subject of immigration reform will also return to the surface - this time as a female theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-president of We Belong Together, a organization that mobilizes women for the immigration reform, said that for a re-examination of the subject as a key female theme, she only needs public history of immigrant women.
"This speaks for himself," said Mercado.
When the large majority of the workvisa goes to male immigrants, the women who join them are in a position where they are appealing to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a neighborhood in women's organizations," she said.

Leonidas bat in the Gladiatorenarena
Not only the Gladiators were cocktailly in the match at the first Rheinbacher Romer day in the free-time park.
However, the attraction force of the event was strong enough to lock over 1000 people yesterday, who disappointed the rain viewers and the rainless colds and allowed the historical species to be disappointed.
There was a great number of representations, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rheinland.
The main attraction of the day was, of course, the martial fighting troops of the Gladiators School "Amor Mortis", which used each rain pause to demonstrate its strong war art in which the arena was prepared with weaken sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" showed himself as a humorous and scientific representative and sent his men together into the ring to a heavy double fight in various Gladiatorial events.
First, the "provocators" were on the row with a right-handed and a short-screen and the legs on the left leg and the right arms.
It followed the "Essedarie" with breast-shirt, short-shirt and wurflace, as well as the iron gladiator helm, bone and arm protection.
It was impressive that the "retiarius", who was thrown up with worf, trizack and dolch against the "secutor", and after a short fight, he struck the bars to the ground.
There the swords were metalically forced, created the shields, and the whirlwinds flew surrounding through the Arena, that they could become a sword and a band around the health of the Gladiators.
But on them had the impressionant "Summa Rudis", the muscleless dispute judge, a always careful eye.
"We wanted to resume the Roman everyday and make the culture of the Roman Time," said Lorenz Euskerchen, president of the chairman of "Freundescircle Romans", the intention behind the species.
After two years of preparation, a "oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vizeburger Master Wehage found in Gruß.
The Romans have not only brought war and recovery into our region, but also the Roman culture and many buildings that we are still amazing today.
The rest of them were also to be established at Rome's day, like "Aquaduct-Marmor" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman channel-brooks, which were only at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus-Gesellation presented the water and energy supply and now, and business leader Petra Fricke knew, "We are still going to benefit from that time."
This also affects the Diplom Measure Engineer Ralph Sainter from the "Ingenieur Team Two" from Rheinbach, the Romans' mixing instruments such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Romervilla in Blankenheim presented skits and models of the excavations in 1894 and the steel stones from the original hypocaust, the warm aircraft that at once heated the Roman whale.
It is also impressive to the footprints that were left by wolf and fuch two thousand years ago in the footsteps of sound before they were made.
2011 the Office for Landenkmalking at the Landsbank Rheinland had buried the rest of a Roman village in the North Park of Rheinbach.
We have found walls of a economic building with a darre to dry out of cereals and milk.
The building probably heard of a Villa Rustica, a agricultural good, said the architect Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A series of funds from these excavations represented it in a glass vitrene, including a large tell, a number of fine glass fats and parts of a zealous coat.
The Villa has already existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the Germans in the Roman Rheinland at that time, Morcheiser assumes.
The children also worked with the Roman windmill game, similar to today’s mill game, or they wrote as one of the Roman students their names with metal cakes on guard staff.
In the state of the Roman Term Zeltpich, the children of Mosaiken were able to place themselves, at the position of the glassmuse, Rheinbach glassmosaiken, and in the condition of the natural egg Netersheim, a severe grain meal from stone to meat the meal for a flood bread or a mysli.
The original road cars followed by two cold flowers passed through the free-time park and came to the impressive state of the City Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Rome project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the assembly of Watchberg will also be introduced in the year 2014 of Rome in Rheinland, which will refer to the death of Caesar Augustus 2000 years ago.
In combination with the home and historical unions, as well as the Watchberger Wander-Unit, the Partnership Association and the Game Circle Oberbachem, including thematic warnings, a statement, cocaine and school class leaders, and the Roman past watchbergs.
For example, a Roman legionary of his work on the tourist watchberg will be told, presenting Pf·en as living minds from Rome’s time and offering a significant time of teaching in matters of peoples' consensus between a group of "Germans" and associated Romans.
The Adendorfer Base School is dedicated to the Roman theme within a project week.
With the Roman week, the numbered, but often not more, will be restored to the first visible tracks of the Romans in Watchberg.
In the Watchberger Rathaus, a small presentation will be reminded of the Berkumer Matronen Fund in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemy is charged by the West African economy
Ebola epidemia in Western Africa is also a serious struggle for the economy.
Markets are deceived - and international enterprises go to distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemia represents the West African economy a severe struggle.
The greenhouse is broken on the fields that are left of mines and the markets are devastated - the virus has severely added the region.
Some international enterprises are also going to distance.
"The Ebola Epidemy is not only a medical crisis but also a economic crisis," judges the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is affected by herotic tests
"It's a total disaster, we're losing very much money," Alhaji Bamogo says, who's covering clothing on the second largest market in Liberia's main city of Monrovia.
On the market only comes who wants to buy food or something to defect against Ebola.
Liberia was found most of the virus, and there alone was more than 600 people who were victims.
Recently, the health stakeholders explained that the disease was in each angle of the country.
Also in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria have spread the virus.
In total, more than 1500 people have died, thousands of others have been attacked.
External companies remove employees
Wherever the resources are available, enterprises shall deploy their operation.
Foreign companies, such as the Arcelor Stainholder, take away their employees, and several international flight companies are no longer involved in the regions concerned.
Also the domestic traders and farmers react: only a few purchasers left their householders to get back.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantanees, inter alia, the important cacao and coffee bones on the fields for export.
The farmers don't care to leave their home for the herb.
Food getting Buttons
"The people will always be less traveling," says Phillip De Vreyer, Pariser Expert for West Africa's economic.
For example, the man, who usually goes to the market and crosses his trees, is better at home.
Thus, the population has the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food will be no longer.
On the markets, the presidency is decreased by basic feeding materials such as rice.
At the same time, the strong region depending on international enterprises threatenes an image damage - with largely significant consequences.
The greatest is that international companies are fundamentally avoiding the area for long time, says Philippe Hugon from French Think Tank Iris.
Determining how far and how long the virus will be spread.
In investors, the impression may be "that it is annual to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore to invest", advises Hugon.
The illness also charges the strapazed State budgets of the States
The illness also charges the strategy of the State assets of the countries concerned.
The Rating Agency Moody's promises that its budgets are highly strategy from the high amounts for the health system and later from the harmful economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million euros (45 million euros).
The effects are also evident in Nigeria, where only few Ebola cases have been decreased.
The oil region in the southern Nigerdelta has not yet been affected.
However, in other cases, many people are already home before a covering.
Reservations in hotels are also clearly returned.

The original term "S­S­gesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" comes from 1907, as founded on 21 March of the United Nations for "society interview by exercising in rooms and small chaliers".
The NS regime had encouraged the resolution of the union in 1937.
Before 1964, 19 young men found themselves again, who brought the "new" "tannenwald" Berngau out of the baptism on 30 April in Gasthaus Luke.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the United as a Sement Master through a difficult starting time when it was especially to find an association and install the shooting.
Just in Herbst 1965, the Sövenunion started fighting in the Gashaus "Leininger" with two men in the law.
In the following years, the sports that were organized in seven communities were established in all classs until the 1st Gauliga.
The association records pursued annually and the magical limit of 380 rings was reached by Rudi Meier for the first time 1980.
As the efficiency of active sights has increased, the payments of members have also developed positively.
After the association "Leininger" has no longer been entrusted with a modern union, the daily representation under the lead of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future domizil in the chambers of the new "Landgasthof Herteis".
After a work of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988 Pfarrer Streets gave the church blessing for the new rooms.
One of the large points in the association history was of course the 44th shooting, connected to the festivals of the new shops in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the United Nations held its 30-year-old constitutional jubileum.
1995 has been established a B's group.
Joseph Schmalzl became B-referent.
A big challenge for the "B&R" and for the total unit was the orientation of the Bayer Baching Meeting 2005.
In many hours of honest work, the members have modernized the rooms and shooting facilities in the Bergauer Court and have thus brought to the latest state of technology.

Now the officer is aware of it again.
But it is not a free letter for all complex details.
Heavy thoughts from the CDU against the Pkw wall have seen the CSU.
Federal Cancer Angela Merkel has spoken of a power to introduce a Pkw wall after sustainable resistance from its CDU.
"To say clearly, she is in the Coalition Treaty, and she will come," the party officer said on Monday after meetings of the CDU hospital bodies in Berlin.

Genetic síveis often wrong
One British says she thought as a result of a failure diagnosis over many years she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the faith that she had only a few years to live after she had been infected with another disease.
She was actually in the Charcot-Marie Tooth illness (CMT) - a group of inherited sprays that damage the nerves outside the brain and the backmark.
Charity CMT UK shared that failure diagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because this disease is so little.
About 23,000 people in the United Kingdom suffer to CMT, which can lead to engineering such as muscle weaknesses, an unsecure walk and covered teases.
The disease is unhealthy and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she suffered from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the roll chair before she was 18, and died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who were 51 years old today said, "All the child I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I've always fallen and everything was longer with me.
I was never able to drive with the other children Rollschuh or Skateboard and was often at school for my kind and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 years after several operations to extract her sons of Achille and stretch their feet, she agreed to her hospital acts when her army left the room and read that she was leaving on FA.
"I felt guilty because I was interesting, so I told nobody, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA challenging," she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked and scared in panic.
I thought I would be in the roll chair with 18 and die with 25, and I would soon lose all my abilities.
I did all this alone with me and plant my own funeral.
She said, when she became 17, she realized that her abilities had not taken so strongly as she had presented it and asked her army.
He just stood up, and weared me and said, "My love, I don't think you have it, else you'd be in the role chair."
I think you've got something much less threatening to life.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was detected.
"If he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT-awareness month to take care of this disease.
Stabsfieldwebel a. D. Berni Diether ≥ since the ex-treaming place was closed as fireworker
For almost years, there is no shot on the former trip exercise place in Muniching.
Nevertheless, the Swebish Album is still in the heart piece of the biosphäre area.
The granates are sometimes so sensitive that they need to be spread out of the place.
An earbuilding knall takes place in the pressures over the heart piece of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the latest scarce shooting was on the band exercise place Münsingen, which ended 2005 after 110 years of military operation.

Tax charge of business carriers in Washington room increases with economic recovery
Recurrence of the economic means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means taxes.
State and local tax accommodations for companies in the country were easily increased last year, while the economic recovery was accelerated, such a new publicity in the last week, and the companies in Washington room did not constitute an exception.
Company in the Room District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid 27.6 billion dollars to public and local bodies in 2013, increased by 3.8 Pro gegenüber the 2012 revenue by 26.6 billion dollars.
The State and local tax burden of the companies increased by 4.3 Pro in the past year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 Pro per year earlier, and it was the growth year after the several years deceived in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than the local taxes, by 4.3 Pro, as the services agency, Ernst & Young, with the Centre for State Taxing, a tax policy group.
More than the half of the tax income in the district, 56 Pro, comes from business taxes, while 36% of Marylands income originate from companies.
Virginia is obtaining the lowest tax income from undertakings.
A majority of the increase in tax income is based on a recovery of the immobility values of the enterprises, the researchers say, which led to an increase in immobility taxes by 3.7% in this year after the three following years with growth rates of less than 1%.
A large part of these wins from large states such as California, New York and Texas appear to be attended to the Washington room.
Company in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over 10 billion dollars to State and local immobility taxes last year, compared to $9,6 billion 2012 - an increase of 4,2 per cent during a year.
However, the seeming recovery of immobility values in Maryland is not so effective in the creation of public and local tax income, since the immobiliary taxes are in place to be more than a fifth of the tax collectors of companies.
Undertakings in Virginia and D.C. were nearly the half of their state and local taxes in the form of immobility taxes.
"In Maryland the following is: a large part of the immobility, especially in the tax area of D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organisations which do not pay immobility taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, business leader of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to, for example, trust much more in income taxes in order to provide the same services offered by other countries.
The latest recovery of tax income by companies cannot be calculated only for the recovery of immobility.
Undertakings also appear to be recovered, as the data are.
Undertakings in the region reported income taxes in State organizations of $2,3 billion in comparison with $2,1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took 1 billion dollars in business income taxes, the maximum amount of the region.
As the trend goes into the same direction, the local tax charge for companies does not increase equally at all three places.
The increase rate in the district corresponded to 4,3 Pro to the national average while the increase in Maryland was clearly 4,9 Pro.
Only Virginia reported a average tax income of 4,1 Pro.
Virginia has the most clearly lowest enterprise taxes in all three areas official areas (in all three there are fixed taxes).
The company tax in Maryland is 8.25 Pro and in the district at a relatively high 9,975 Pro.
A comparable set of the US Trade Chamber at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia there are smaller State and local business taxes required and a better tax climate is in total than in Maryland.
In the area, the district was not investigated.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure through his southern neighbors.
North Carolina has proposed laws on the reduction of its taxes in this year of 6,9 Pro a 6 Pro, to the same term as Virginia, and the term will be decreased to 5 Pro. in the next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income objectives in the next year, this law could reduce the income tax of the State until 2017 to 3%.
Meanwhile, it seems to be better going to the small operators in Washington room, and therefore they spend more state and local taxes, as the youngest.
Employment taxes payed as individual income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that is organized by most small enterprises - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent in the past year to 2.4 billion dollars, a clearly faster growth rate than the company taxes.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business taxes throughout the country will be deteriorated in this year, with an increase in the general multilateral tax income for the State and local governments by 6,2 per per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 in comparison to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the room of Washington could hinder if the deficiency of the Federal Government affects the work in the region.
Partner City: German Beer for Guangzhou
Hoppy and Malz - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys a great call in China.
Frankfurt's partner town in China now wants a braveness and also hopes to have a direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, born in Frankfurt Partner City Guangzhou - thus is the thrilled desire of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German bruise would be left in our city," said the Vize party secretary of the South Chinese Metropole, Li Yiwei, in this week during a SPD delegation in his city.
The functionary of the Governing Communist Party of China has always returned during the talk on this place of 12 million metropole.
Guangzhou, who is also called Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities of China.
Thus, people also have the purchasing force to be able to provide German beer.
The Hessian SPD president Thorsten Schefer-Gumbel, who led the German delegation, told the guest provider that he would be in Germany as a possible partner for the project.
"To beer, it doesn't need much: water, cereals and livelihood," he added to the dinner with the party in Guangzhou.
This rejoicing of life has already been distracted by Mr. Li, and he has mixed the guest.
Afterward, the functionary from Guangzhou with a shipbuild - but with red wine that was served to eat.
The Chinese mark Tsingtao returns to German Braukunst.
Tsingtao beer is broken after the German purity offer.
More business traffic
A second desire of the Chinese guest provider would be a direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Partchef Li.
The airhansa had offered the flight earlier, but in 2012, it was for economic reasons.
"It would be recompensed again," the Communal Policies proved convinced.
"The trade trading between our two cities continues to grow."
Currently, travelers had to take the road over Changsha in the province of Hunan, claimed Li.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose main city is Guangzhou, also hopes the flight connection.
The vice Governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, presented this desire to talk to the social democrats.
"This is a very nice idea," shepherd Gumbel replied - the Chinese Vice minister Li Jinjun, an intimate German identifier, agreed.
Companied Partnership
Guangzhou's famous vice party officer hopes that he can visit Frankfurt at a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on it, but not yet in this function.
He came to the office first in this year after his advocates were transferred from the office for corruption projects.
Moreover, the local party officer Wan Qinglian had to go.
The action against the functionaries of Guangzhou is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in the party and the administration carried out by Governing Boss Xi Jin.
Li Yiwei's new top policies had been held before his partakers for an ananian business, which is most unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before official access to Guangzhou, he was employed as a post officer in Fujian, where the car builder VW created a large work.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a thousand cities partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 km remote guangzhou belongs to those who are bound by both sides, such as the exchange of a student.
Last year, the 25-year-old existence of German-Chinese Connection was established.
The South Chinese Metropole on Perlfluss, with its economic power, is almost as strong as the whole horse.
The next year, Li reported that it wanted to obtain a brutto-inland product of 250 billion euros.
Family of Joan Rivers
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was entered into a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter has shown hope today that the 81-year-old comicer has been recovered from her illness.
"There is for your enduring love and support," Melissa Rivers said today in a message.
We're all pressing the pumps.
According to her mother, sources were delivered on Thursday after an emergency because of heart condition in a clinic at the top East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in the Mount Sinai hospital.
The doctors are obviously seated and under a precise observation until they are more satisfied with their state, which continues to be described as "ernst".
The reactions came from many pages, including in the form of an overall online support of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmental powder and increased salaries
For cars and dusts coming into trade from today, the future environmental standards are more strict.
Similarly, as cold and washing machines, new dusts receive from 1 September to a label where the buyer can identify the energy efficiency of the device on a corner of central data, such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, in the shadow class "Euro 6" the higher values of oxide oxide are applied.
○ There are more money for the builders: they receive a totally united minimum loan of EUR 10,25.
Amazon buys Twi for 1.04 billion dollars
AMAZON also visited what information had reported on Monday morning: The online single-handler - and video-products, and a number of other things - buying the video streaming service Twi for 1.04 billion dollars (970 million dollars).
The announcement is surprising, not because no one expected a Twi's receipt, but because it was far thought that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Twi to the Google video service for a cool billion things, and the cooperation also occurs, of course.
Twi, which was founded first three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it was quickly to a platform for players who wanted to publish their goods in games, a YouTube for live games, like an inside.
The Twi interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which the best whistler gives the games (the most older) a sign of mysterious science theater, they are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twi, so the message that YouTube Twi wanted to buy was recorded something lowly, an example of a established technology company that would be found in a potential competitor.
It is a ratio why the deal with YouTube did not stand because the company was ready, according to reports, to cover as much as Amazon.
All we know about this is the statement of Emmet Shear, President of Twi, "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community that they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get faster there."
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twi.
For Snobs like me, who claim that they are better sporting than to see them, it is difficult to understand the attraction that comes from seeing others when playing, instead of taking into hand the control console.
It's a thing to look at a friend at 3 a.m. tomorrow over the sculpture, while it's swimming by the resident Evil, and something else to look at a spinner at how he's shot 20 times in the Call of Duty in the head.
All these games you could look right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego games, so the view can be without self-control of the CTPs a correct recept for head pain.
I admire that the shirts in which the Roger Bannisters of our electricity age are aware of all the games in record time.
But as long as there is no game or humor viruses there, his Twi channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics know about me?
Twi seems to be called from 55 million different sugars per month and is the fourth largest source of internet transport.
And what exactly does Amazon want to do of it?
It is difficult to imagine that Twi is so elegantly integrated in Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twi could easily shoot.
But Twi has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who will be murdered as advertisers.
As the president of Twi, Shear, said, Amazon and Twi have "believed both in the future of the Gaming", and the media shows no signs of a breakdown, not even - shock - as a viewport.
At the Heepburg at Burggarten Festival, some things happened on Sunday evening.
The concept of actors was true.
Despite the powerful rainhouse on Saturday, 1200 musicians were estimated at the open-Air festival in the burggart.
In time, the entry had to be arrested.
"It was terrible," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Saltwedel l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem designed the name Aula.
Because the Open Air in the salt garden will stretch light by various shows day and evening.
Well, and the fun comes from alone.
This appeared already on the early Sunday evening when the first trainers were opened to Open Air.
A festival for all generations had pronounced the organisers.
And that has been done to them.
As regards the supply conditions on the burggart wheel, the salt weakened, but also guests from the nearest and further environment.
They followed the first live resorts, wiped with the foot in the takt, enjoyed cold trees - short: Relief clean and enjoyed.
And that's crazy through the genre.
As one of the white sands on the covered white on the strange side, others laughed on a fourth wine in the Vinothek, the neighborhood on the Heepburg, which was a big attractive point for the smaller guests.
But also during the childhood, the volunteers in the true meaning of the word had to fill all hands in order to become the Andrang Lord and to devote imaginative crew in the small faces.
The sizes used the kickertic or shared in a skateboard workshop that the goodfoot-Crew from saltweed.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 p.m., he praised on the tuckers, especially the families seeking the wheat and dry.
But the Attra’s Festival did not break this.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
That is why a repeat of the great party will not occur in the next year.
Although the contents and sizes of the event needed to be held, Sem made clear in a first bi-date on Sunday against the people's voice.
As a worry, he claimed that the entry had to be arrested at the time.
Obviously, the security form was born with too few powers.
The following: Some who had already paid no longer came to the territory.
The resonance was very good.
In a first precautionary seat, the saltweather competitor spoke of approximately 1200 guardians in the garden of Burggard.
There were problems in the tone technology.
The Hip-Hop-Band Blocks'n'Rox's saltwedel is therefore disturbed.
The technicians were not able to create a half-way reasonable sound.
The scheduled Shisha Lounges could not be built because the cells were not able to be brought to salt.
"They will be with the next year," as the dealer.
The premium of the Amul-Open Airs was more than possible from the rates.
And that in bad weather.
However, the engineers have committed some errors that will be made for the first time, but need to be removed in the second layout.
In addition to the Facebook social network, the participants need to criticize.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you have just expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event site.
"It's sorry you've taken a little bit," El roomman says at the same place.
Others do not see the starting problems so hard.
I think it's very good that some don't just stupid, but really try to put something on the legs.
Shut off!", writes Stephanie Jenß to the amul.
Now it remains a year for the stakeholders to deal with these critical points.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchberg's warehouse marks
It does not expect to be like that.
Moreover, the prepared building is expected to be used in the marking building.
The action is in the context of a greater measure: nearly 50 years after the TIRA World Observatory Radar is renewed completely.
The new radom will be a diameter of 47.5 meters a little smaller than the old.
However, the size still remains a well-tree order.
The last step to complete the new hall is the chapter exchange
The upper quarter of the old hill is cut off and taken with a cran.
Afterward, the last quarter of the new hole will be set up.
If the weather is playing, the action will go over the stages at the beginning of this week.
Participant at the Ice Bucket Challenge is dealing with kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Britain cried so much when her cold water was cast over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket Challenge was painful.
A woman was delivered to the hospital after she had shouted so much at the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that she was cut off the kitchen.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain was so much crossing when her cold water was cast over her head that she hurt her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did it, my kitchen was just standing," she said to the Mirror.
Iron water is shot over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it wasn't what the chief was shot, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw that, and they laughed almost in the woods, but I had to take the need.
The 20-year-old Britain was delivered to the hospital in order to return to the kitchen after attending the viral trend on Saturday.
The Clip was linked to a Internet session and thousands of times to Facebook and Twitter.
Will the villages go back on a street?
There was always twist between the two Wolfrat Houses.
Now the events think about a possible cooperation.
As an example of the rebuilding of the Wolfrate House Burg, the deceased Richard Dibath, the former president of the Wolffrat House Friends, introduced the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no climate between the Burgverein and the Friendly Wolfrate House.
The views of the story of the Wolfrasshouser Burg and a possible rebuilding appeared different.
Now the two camps are moved to each other: talks on a joint action must be made soon.
This visits the associations of Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriends) on request of our magazine.
"I have called Mr Piffl and proposed that we should be able to set together once," she reports.
See the view that all members of both units could be moved back to a strange.
This is how to make more visible success.
Since the village friends around the sudden discouraged Richard Dimbath had a rebuilt of the village on the mountainwald, the "Exclusion and experience" of the country is the first place for the Burgverein on Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, second President of the Burg Friend, was very pleased by its own information on the call.
Since Dibath's death, he has been present to the burg friends.
A new president will be found in a assembly in mid September.
At the moment, the unit counts about 40 members according to the 74-year-old.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dibath, we have made the associations relaxed from respect to." This "Dinkphase" was needed to "remember how it could continue".
According to Piffl, the new president will then go to the talk with the municipality.
Until then, the municipal friends could also make a current voting image within their grouping.
A candidate for the president is still not, says Piffl.
"But I am sure someone will find it." He doesn't want to candidate himself because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a Wolffrat House.
The trainer wants to work on the project, but he wants to continue.
The different positions in the rebuilding of things will remain in the eyes of Piffls in the next time.
He appreciates Dibath as a missionary, who always believed in the rebuilding of the village.
Two similar, long-progressed projects in Austria and France would show that this idea wasn't locked.
By a high participation of the population and by volunteers of the world, they are a tourist magnetic.
Piffl: "I was also skeptic at the beginning.
But in the course of the time, I have become more and more convinced that it is meaningful to advance the project.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU bills, tickets and potential sponsors, it believes Piffl.
"The idea of the rebuilding I personally don't want to throw on the board." He hopes that the municipality may move something at this point.
Their goal to document the story is "important and good".
Then you could continue to see.
Clare ways to save at university teachers
Since the costs for university teacher books for many students were more than $1,000 per year, the fast-time student Matt Schro faced a smarter sparidee.
He experienced a system of guidelines for books of students of semesters and offered a nominal detention to delay the return.
"My Mathebook costs usually $80, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-case," shoe, 19, who visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have made him $430, he said.
He gave 120 dollars.
The College Leader shared that the student in the average had more than $00 per year for teacher books and materials, but there are different options for the students.
Online areas and creative approaches such as the shore are continuing to solve the choice for students.
The meeting of teachers will be more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester long, often to a clearly more favorable price than for purchasing.
Neebo Inc, who was more than 250 university books, shared that the middle of text books has doubled since 2011.
Question in the branch shows that about a quarter of the books was mixed in the college books in the past first year, Neebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than the help of all teach books are purchased, according to the statement of the Trade Association National Propertyation of College Stores in Campus books.
Here's the one time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only a third of the price for which they are in campus bookload.
The nineth of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but the specialized teacher Chegg.com can be used for $239,99.
Buy Used
If any of the notes of other or normal use tracks does not make anything, useful books are an option.
"Calculus" is used at Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, Final Student at the Brigham Young _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The book was rebuilt for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, leader of Massachusetts at Maherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors whether previous statements were allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older debts may often be made for a breakdown of the costs for the latest debt.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, half.com of eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books.
Middle
The mixing of teach books is worth a review if you treat them sometimes well, remember returning them and you don't want to keep the books after the course is closed.
You can save more than 80% of the costs of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could pay "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for approximately $20.
Inform the provisions of the business in which you are taking place, including the penalty taxes, which, for example, are attached to write notes, underlines or use tracks.
Mieter adjusted: If you don't return the book, the penalty taxes can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
In addition, E-Books place of traditional teacher books are an option.
Sometimes these books are mixed de facto by providing a electronic licence for a certain period of major trades such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg, you can pay "Calculus" for 6 months for about 61 dollars.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best boots, since many classicians today can be downloaded freely, while science and engineering books can be very higher.
Look at any case.
Joe Gault, 29, who is going to visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for price determination in books, since you can be sure to find the right teacher book.
And before a online order, you should check if the book is actually advised.
This lesson he learned from the hard tour.
He purchased a book that had four weeks of delivery and paid the full price in the college bookload.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" hasn't become a cassen shot
The "The Expendable 3" of Silvester Stallone played less than 30 million of his 90 million budgets in the United States while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only included 12 million of his budget of 70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" attached to Cameron Diaz played only 14,6 million at the week of exhibition, while children's films such as "Dracks made easily 2" were also incoming.
A article of the telegraph film criticer Robbie Collin indicates that the lack of quality in the films may be the reason for children.
Collin approved 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "Dracks made easily 2" as a pure "functional" Fantasy continuation.
However, films for a little older target group seem like whether the quality of the films is not essentially the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compares the average cinemaScore and Metacritic assessment for each summer movie start, shown between the Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and the current year to at least 2000 walls.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that the current films are equal to those of the last year.
Some commentators believe that the development of changed view habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Regissor Jon Favreau, who presently appears on Disneys soon, said to the Hollywood Reporter: "I think the times change."
We must accept this and do not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the current weak results of the Hollywood productions, Netflix achieved in the latest time the streaming content of 1.2 billion, almost double as in the past year, in which the volume was 837 million.
In the last summer, the Regisseur Steven Playberg criticized the film studies that they had too much on comic films and prophesied a "knocking" holiwoods.
In the light of the current discharge, some commenters argue that his dark prophecy can contain a true kernel.
As a result of the potential casses to be expected in summer 2015, including Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are optimistic:
The product of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, describes the decline of cassen results recently as simple "cyclic" and said to Hollywood reporters: "The next summer will be the greatest summer at the kinocase at all, and no one will worry about the business."
A few years ago, when the 2th Tishennis Bezirk Class has been decreased by the penalty of the League Allocation, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Tishennisband has adopted an additional 3. Bundesliga programme.
The following: Whoever has not risen has gone away.
Thus, the highest team of Göttingen's class Torpedo in the Oberliga Religition has avoided the decline, but in the next season only plays fifth class.
Thursday ladies remain fourth class, despite their big diarrhoea in the Regional Ligue.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Axesenliga, as the boys of the SC Ween.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo Reserves are attached to the new bandsliga, in the landsliga no longer representing Götting Clubs.
At the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandliga, the Torpedo second in the Landsliga.
As regards the composition looks like a better area class, now the new area is south.
There are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Inbeck, Hammensted, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
In the districtly, as regional representatives of Dransfeld and the SC Weden, the Class of TTC II, Red white, the top SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III teams. The districts of the ladies start at least in southern force.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
In the areas, Torpedo III and Sattenhouse/WW are running.
With nine men
The SC Ween sends his girls to the small area.
Moreover, the SCW-Junge's district staff - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weden and the top SV are going to the season.
At the first season of the newly established regional union, the two Göttingers Cruzling started with each nine men.
The west staff contains red white II, above SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Milehouse and SG Lunglern II.
In the East Staff, including satting houses/WW's marshausen, Nikolausberg and landolfish houses are played.
The Ladies-Kreisliga consists of sattenhouses/W's married houses II, Bilhausen, Hemels, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weden and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the circuit of Osterode, where there are no ladies teams on the circuit levels.
Noteing that no one of the six two Crycelasses has reached the low force, the innovative and ambiguous circles will have to think once.
Nato-Gipfel: First Protest in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, there were protests from enemies of the Nato-Gipfel in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered together in the center of Newport to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people came together in Cardiff before the dark city Hall to stop a so-called opposite.
Stephen Fairclough has followed for us the developments of the weekend and spoken to demonstrants traveling from Bridging to Bridging.

Scaling government enemy protests in Pakistan
The approximately 1000 demonstrants were taken by soldiers from the PTV building, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The sender recovered the radiation after a half hours.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that demonstrators equipped with stacks would have protected devices in the editor.
Dead or damage have not been reported.
The demonstrants call upon the Governing Boss' retreatment to which they have a choice deficiency.
The police shared that about a kilometre from the residence of the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was returned to coincidences of approximately 3000 demonstrants with security forces on Monday.
After hospital information, a policeman was hurt.
At least three people were killed at the weekend, and more than 500 were hurt when demonstrants tried to prevent Sharif's residence.
They call for the meeting of the President.
The powerful soldier had called on Sunday after a meeting at the main quarter of the Army to a political solution to the conflict, "forgetting without time and applying without violence".
It further said in the Communication: "The Army remains committed to its role to ensure the security of the State."
The scaling violence has secured anxiety from an intervention of the military, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests mentioned by Opposition Policy Imran Khan and the Preacher Tahirul Qadri are held since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif's refusing a retraction.
Khan and Qadri invited their attachments on Sunday to endure.
"We won't go back without having a Sharif forced to return," Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself similar.
Khan suggests that Sharif has won the parliamentary election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri requests the receipt of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the election system and call on new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use in order to deal with the government quarter.
The demonstrants had also endured peacefully before the Parliament until Khan and Qadri invited them to attend Sharif's residence on the weekend.
Header Dorfers after second seasoning on three places of the table.
With the 2:0 over Greendig, for Rapid, a bitter week on Sunday ended.
"The victory is very free," said Traran Barisic, whose team with the output in Europe League had reached an intermediately on Thursday.
"The successful life was unsecretly important," attracted Captain and Tors Stephen Hofmann, who suggested three places with green-white.
Rapid on the Viger Street Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki, with the second seasonary, and he goes with a successful life in the country game-pause.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said outside-defensive Thomas Schrammel, who, with a glorious flight-Volley from the sixth cycle in the 14th minute, has set the weaknesses on victory.
"I thought I took the whole fruit from Thursday and smoke it under the late," said the 26-year-old laughing.
It was still for Ried as the last time it had occurred on 13 November 2010 in a Federal Legislative Party.
The first mastership in the Rapid Triss will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me this is something very special, I'm out of the rapid growth," said the scream.
As a result of the short-term becken-Blessur of Mario Pavelic screams from the left to the right defensive side and also made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this spectacular position.
The gate he deserved, he has already done some assistants now," praised Barisic.
Mentality shows the Charakter Schrammel also delivered the Fla to 2:0 by Hofmann after a hour that was determined.
Because the guests would have been able to write to this.
"God thanks we have made something lucky today," he also noted the crafts, which so called on the exhaustion of performance and results in the last weeks: "The results did not vote, but the player was always good in comparison to the last year."
Barisic even found that you were "in many games previously better than today" - against "the strongest mention that played in this season in this stadium".
Thus, since 26 July, the first three points have proved that the social additive has been intake to despair: "My master today has shown that she has a character."
Not less pleasant for him, "that we finally played again to zero."
· Work during the country's game pause Also the circumstances that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger are to complain several accidents, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan St® and Philipp Schobesbergers make the winning more valuable.
"You shouldn't forget this," urged Barisic, who lost the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "they were very stable in the past."
Therefore, the country game pause must be used to "leaving wounds and putting a little in the physical area", said Barisic, who has five U21 elections in his range.
One whose pause is particularly placed is Captain Hofmann.
He's scattering for the community, he's going through pain.
Just in this difficult phase he has shown that he is a very important player for us," said Barisic.
Hofmann gave the Rapids game before his exchange in the 68. Minutes not only the structure, but also reached the second gate.
For the 33-year-olds who decided his 350. Bundesliga game, it was the first match from the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "We must not believe that everything is right now" "We must have a little happiness too, but sometimes the happiness must come back to us too.
Now it was the best time," Hofmann said.
He urged freely to continue working: "You must not always see it black and white.
We haven't played so bad in the last weeks as it has been shown.
But we can't even believe that everything is right now.
The importance of his role for the team he couldn't fight.
It's a very young mention that I can help very much at the moment.
They stand at me in some phases," Hofmann said.
Greedy-Coach Michael Baur had a little prejudice to his family.
He suffered the quick opposer "from the category of Zaubertor" and the regular gate of use in the 40th minute, which was accurately recognised by the Colegier.
The only proposal I can do to the community is that we were not adequately specific to the gate in some phases.
We've had too few conclusions there.
Inside-defenced Maximilian Karner saw it similar: "It just started bad, but then we found in and even made a gate.

Under this whipfel there is peace
One strong tribe showed us at our course of the summer series "My part of Rhöner's lucky" on the last Friday.
Many of these trees are still in the country circle, the pictured exemplar is the "hill-shirt" above whitebrown.
A holprid footway leads to the 600-year old eggs.
It goes through groups, basal stones and basal stones.
A piece below the stone break from the Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the street to Weisbach, stands there.
Vital seems to be the natural thought, it is over the other trees of the surrounding area and reflects a range of more than eight metres to a mammut tree.
A small Buddha on a bath tube indicates that it is a spiritual or mysterious place.
Despite intensive research, however, there were only indications on the origin of names.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider further consulted the Bischofsheim archive and asked older people from sub-white brun to learn what conduct it has with the throat.
The result of his investigations remained the very close statement for the name.
Thereafter, until 80 years ago, the shepherds of the cattle must have spent their animals from white-brown wheat to the furious wheat and freed from stones.
At the feet of the tree, the animal guards that are exhausted by the rise shall have been equipped.
Meanwhile, the area has won its importance, because the species actually have goat herds.
The area has also been explained to the nuclear zone of the biospheric reservation, and has further discovered Sneider.
However, when the assembly of stone collections comes, you should be careful because the basealtal that is heated by the sun is also a popular residence place for cross-zotters.
A waterway leads from white bridge to the tree, but something hidden.
Other ways are drawn up, up to the higher direction and invite to an expanded wall.
Where's the waterburg?
However, a waterburg looking for our next task is rarely found in the height.
The mirror in the grave already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the country circle to which the building conflict could fit.
Where's our "Free lucky piece"?

After weekly crossing, the Italian Prime Minister and official President, Matteo Renzi, have implemented the nomination of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as the leader of the EU foreign policy, which will be followed by Britin Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the nearby Government Journal of La Republic renewed, the vocation of Mogherini, also in the Government team as a favourite, as a strengthening of the position of social democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects an exhibition for his "reform package" in Italy.
It is not later hoped that Renzi would always have the right to put the left base to him, because Mogherini will be adequately added to it, even if it was more appropriate.
In contrast with the conservative representatives of the Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Poland, nominated as Council President, Donald Tusk, will be the pre-governmental opinion in Rome in order to make a political compensation.
Because the EU's head diplomatic is at the same time a representative of the Commission President Juncker.
The remaining approval of the EU Parliament shall be considered safe.
Otherwise, State President Giorgio Napolitano would have called the nomination of the 41-year-old democracy party (PD) a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Republic has spread the optimism that the members of the Governing Boards have cared for nearly two years and will show the "great challenges" for their honesty.
The birthday Roman is married and has two daughters.
Its partakers started the promoted policy in 1996 in the Youth Organization of Youth Democracy di Sinistra (Linksdemocrats), which joined 2008 with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita to today's social democratic PD.
1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election of 2001 to the Partnership of the Left Democrats, they entered the High Party Policy, which was soon in the External Policy Department.
The traditional points of Italian foreign policy such as the Near East have been taken through the NATO intervention in Afghanistan, which has been shared in Italy with a troop quota, and have been contacted with the social democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she is a member of the Deputy Chamber in which she is a expert for defence and international matters.
When Renzi became Premier in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If the PD today has a better relationship with strong peace movement in the country, which has contributed to over 40% of the votes of the Partie in the EU walls in May, I have, as noted in PD circuits, a part of it.
The preservations in Brussels, which the new EU foreign officers have too few diplomatic experiences, thus failing to substance, are included in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, the mistruous realistic accents of Mogherinis to the crisis in Ukraine and diffamed as a "Russian friendly course".
It provides the Pipeline South Stream of the Russian Company of Gasprom to be transported directly to South Europe through the Russian Earth Gas throughout Ukraine, which also serves the Italian energy security.
After Renzi attended his office as EU president in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow at its first national visit.
Photos that they showed with Putin at the Shake hands were taken in Brusela with empathy, as well as they introduced the creml head for October to a Middle Economy Guinea.

The socialists in France should "hold the mouth and arrange France," said the main associate of Francois Holland.
Mr. Valls called the deeply divided links to show "the love" for the conflicted socialist presidents, whose cabinet formation was cut into dissatisfiance in the large majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our obligation to stay on his side," he said at a great applause.
As a prompt gesture, the Prime Minister pointed out that his Government would not question the contrary 35-hour week in France, despite demands on the lockering of the system of pages Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister of Economics.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland invited his socialists to show "unity" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, struck sand in the camps where she was at a meeting of a delicate socialist deputy and the socialist party criticized that she accepted the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Footnote, disturbed the constant grave fights of the socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Vall government would be held for more than a few months.
Francois Holland is the Caesar without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no one, they are also forced to form a new government if the old man has not even overlooked a summer.
"And the new will also not survive the herbst or winter," Mrs. Le Pen said to subscribe.
She repeated the call of her party after a resolution of the Parliament and said that she was confident that it would be a victory in previous elections and be ready to go to the Government.
The Governing Party of France takes a decrease at the communal elections in March and the legally-oriented national front was at the EU walls in May.
A survey in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche showed that 76% of the French are the opinion that the socialist party was exposed to deteriorating in several rivalising groups before the end of the Office of the Netherlands 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve a improvement of the economic and record labourlessness.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but the public opinion must quickly feel that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may continue to be worse.

Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China daily after the election decision.
A peking tree group washed near the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Committee of the National People's Conference adopted a framework law on Sunday, which allowed only two or three candidates for the election in Hong Kong in 2017.
In addition, all candidates need to achieve the majority of the support of a nomination commit, which is probably occupied with peking loyal members.
This decision will almost be impossible for oppositional democrates to be allowed to choose and the pro-democracy activists to carry out their train and laugh the Hong Kong financial place with the "Occupy Central Protectors".
Political reforms have been a conflicting topic in Hong Kong since a long time, and China's party management has threatened that the calls to democracy spread to other cities.
After publishing a Pekinger White Book, in which China's predecessor was presented over Hong Kong in June, the democracy activists held an inofficial referendum on the election procedure in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands of people marched in the city's business and organized a Sit-in.
Lis Question is organized by the Government in Hong Kong and the Chinese connection office in Hong Kong.

Student activists announced to gather themselves before the driving office in Hong Kong on the afternoon.
Britain had no democratic elements in Hong Kong until the end of the 150-year-old colonial government.
Putin requested by Kiew to record "statal talks" with the Ostukraine
The Russian president Wladimir Putin requested Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government would make the fight against the separatists in the east of the country and directly adopt negotiations on the "State" of the separate region.
His speaker Dimitri Peskow later explained that Putin did not make it clear that the area under the control of the separatists would be part of Russia, but that his status against Ukraine must be redefinited to give the Russian the power to represent his rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiewer Government to negotiate with the pro-Russian residents, however, is likely to be followed from the exhaustion from five months ago: help for separatists in the introduction of areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly announced region Novorossia real independence for a alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Television Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to restore the regions held by separatists in the regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had refused the Ukrainian Halbinsel Crim on 18 March.
The creml and the separatists have recently covered the area as "Novorossia" or "Newsland", a term that refers to the pre-revolutionary time of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who were in the movement of the Ukrainian campaigns for the waves on 26 October and during the government groups attack civil communities in the regions held by separatists hoped to be "captured in their illusions", reported Itar tax.
"We must take immediate complemental discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of the Society and the State of Southeast Tukraine, in order to observe the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to the State must be seen in the context of the larger autonomy discussed for months by the Kiewer Voyage to spread promises in Russian language areas that their cultural and language rights were assigned.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the areas, said Peskow.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "for it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but a internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the cremling speaker for the correction of the "fault interpretation" of Putin's comments underlined the Russian leadership calling on the separatist rebellion in the east, contrary to the direct annection of the Crime, in which the majority of 2 million people are ethnic Russian.
Moscow had greater difficulties to ignore the regions of Donezk and Luhansk in the Ostkrain, since most of the 6,5 million people were not Russian and asked about a wide majority of the residence in Ukraine from the time before the conflict.
The autonomy invited by Russian diplomats to international fores would give the regional governments in Ukraine full power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, whereas the Kreml de facto controls the area associated with the crisis by the Russian State.
The half annuised five months ago in the Black Sea is the homestaff for the majority of the Russian marine, as well as a major trade port and historical coast region.
Furthermore, the regions between the Rostow area in Russia and the Crime are rich in mines, factories and gitteries, which make major components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his speech of official introduction on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - after new election - should consider the adjustments to the Constitution, with which the respective areas will be established to increase the control of their financial and the status of languages.
But his presence of autonomy seems to be strictly opposed to those of the creml and the separatist rebels whose weapons and opposition will be provided in Moscow.
Putin's last invitation to Kiew to negotiate with the Separatist leaders on eye-height, followed another advancement of the rebels last week after Russian troops and panzers were introduced over the previous peaceful region near the Asian Sea in the Ostkrain.
The separatists supported by Russia were taken in the handline, which is the control of Newoasowsk, according to the threats of the Ukrainian security officer, of the first step of a campaign to take the strategic coast region to the crisis.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been made to establish Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Newoasowsk and the smal access to the seal of Crim.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leader in Brussels and requested acts to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are quickly standing before a point where there is no back," the Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of strangers are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Guide has not decided concrete action, which requested the draft further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in an unspecified scale of Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian panzer colons and 1.000 soldiers entered the Donez region last week to submit the hosted separatists, Mr. Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiew.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers included by the Russian attack in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian cattle hungers captured in Ukraine a week ago, and Lysenko divided on Sunday.
Nakt photoscadal for Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not heal his difficulties about hackers, who probably shot naked images of his loving Gabi Grecko and a Who is the A-Promise from Hollywood.
The movie city is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence has been found in a hacking channel on the Internet.
The hacker responsible for it is more than 60 naked photos of Lawrence, Star from "the Tribute of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the songs Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the shower Kirsten Dunst.
From the Australian spectaculars Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Greek from Melbourne also appeared to be private photos due to a iCloud light.
The list is 101 Promis.
The most precious who had lost with Grecko last month said to the confidential, "It's opposite."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information has been shooted and can be transmitted to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, reports stated that the hack was "wonderful" and that the concerned felt "wrong".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with his former friend Scott Speedman, including two records in which it lies up without a pool.
The Palmers' film works belong to "Love is unseenable" with Liam Hems日th.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the looker Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It's a disgusting damage of speech."
Seth Rogen convinced the hacker in Tweet: "Hacked images from a phone is nothing other than the sale of hehlerware."
Purely viewed should not be tolerated by the further spread of screened images.
Radlers, Joggers and Wanderers were attended last night at the 8th rows on the Great Mountain and thus supported the United "Help for Cancer Children".
The tour, for which one was a torture, made the others a easy training.
In one, however, they all agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski may have slept well last night.
For the first time in life, the head of the Supersell Brauhause was driven to the fieldberg yesterday.
For the good purpose.
The small muscle cat can easily cut off, even if he had a valuable knowledge of his participation on the 8th rows on the Great fieldberg for the "Help for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt).
That's a great thing.
"I know now I can do that - good!"
Small powder on the road in the applause curve?
No, if I stopped once, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the city parliament, many of the 718 participants attended to the mountains last morning, and the creation came near, but happy on the plateau.
Others, however, were easier to overcome the well 11 km long streets between Highmark and Feldberg.
For example, Norman Dießner.
The entire green politician from the cross - red dress, red truck - made something on the beginning (Every quantity of Professors, there is the goal!"), but then he showed himself as half Profi and went after 45 minutes without atemnot through the goal.
He also passed the street in a rush, as well as Nina Kuhn, the press speaker of the city overursel, who had made himself on the way with Frank Greeneisen.
For the two triathlets, the "Feldberg Radeln" was not absolutely a sporting challenge: "This is about Charity, there we are pleased to do with it - an exemption we would have made today without it," so cook.
On the road they met Paul Wenzel from Upperreifenberg.
The boy (12) was sent down to the top of the morning to stramp back to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Ziez had been thrown in the satellite at 9 a.m. in the morning, "to make" the fieldberg twice to roll home with fun.
It was fun, too, "Friten-Toni".
For the head of the Superurseler Kultkiosks, road tours are simply part of the fieldberg.
He had split up with 6.5 kilo road 40 minutes.
A crazy event.
For this purpose, I'm pleased to do it," said Andreas Balzke.
The intertrained dealer says of himself that he is a "ambitionated roadler".
He must also be, because he was on the "Fixy Council" road, even though it's a roadman, but without sharing...
That it also went up without a road locker, not only the 20 walkers that ascended over the white walls and the rock station, but also a jogger who dropped a car ride on a cordel with weights behind.
Professor Volker Lischke, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, said for security: "These I know" from Frankfurt, trained for a special shoot trail, only that he holds the shoes himself." So the man is certainly his own shoot dog.
The 718 participants - and so many as never - were sent in groups on the streak tomorrow.
The wanderers first at 9:30.
It followed the first road carriers and runers at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bickers left.
Bent Hansen, president of the "Radeln on the Great fieldberg", gave the start commands and wanted the participant a beautiful run.
For the next year, he hopes that it is possible to lock the streets to the fieldberg up to the security of the participants.
