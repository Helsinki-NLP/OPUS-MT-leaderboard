There's ten minutes later.
We waited for it yesterday.
Tom said Mary was low.
Where's the output?
If I remember right, Tom sold his car to Mary for $500.

She bought a tea service.
We'll all die.
Tom continued to cry.
I can't do it yet.
George was out of his wrath!
You've fucked me.
Are you ready to learn?
Poor are also people with feelings.
I'm sure Tom's just trying to do it.
You have such a good smoke.
I forgot everything about them.

You're learning French?
Is he your son?
Tom never asked why.
He was often lifted up to late.
I don't eat the bananas often.
Get them out of here.

I thought Tom'd be welcomed.
Now it's my turn.
You're listening to them.
Tom's got his favorite pen.
I want to examine the body of the victim.
Where have you oiled them?
Maybe he died with a falafel in his hand.

Don't use it, right?
I'd better take you home.

What do you think?
Hello if you see her!
Where did you pack them?
He made it slowly.
Hey, wait!
I want you to give me a job.
We're getting out now.
I was with her last night.
Did you ever go on a bathroom?
I still have to do it.
You're not eating anything.

Tom's not here now.
I have just one thing to ask you.
Take a bit of birthday tort.
Can you read?
I'm still young.
He's eating himself.

Are you done in trouble?
Call Tom.
Tom doesn't like to drive.
I passed my holidays in Tunisia.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

Did you know Tom and Mary are good at golf?
Who are you to decide?
Why don't the police arrest Tom?
She's taking her.
He's still in the kitchen, right?
You don't want to talk to my girlfriend.
He at least doesn't fix his sena.

It's important for you to keep this secret.
We should start looking for Christmas gifts for children.
She refused to pay.
Tom called his dog Cookie.
Send her out.

I sounded that song so much I could do when I was sleeping.
I want to take your car for a hour.
I can't stop laughing.

Can you make them smile?
Tom can go if he wants.
I want to work with you.
I love wearing sport clothing.
Why were you so scared?
Tom and Mary cried out.
I don't even have a job.
I like to imitate the Kingdom of Elizabeth.
We should have told him the truth.

Who is he?
Is the supermarket open tonight?
I told Tom exactly what I saw.
Mr. Suzuki teaches us English.
What is the best way to travel?
Tom lives with you?
What's the problem, dear?
I don't want them to be angry.
Is Tom really sick?
He didn't wash his hair.
I read your letter yesterday.
Go to the supermarket once a week.
Can I marry my grandmother's grandmother?
I believe it.
She was fun from her son's baggage.

It was the first to do it.
Are the kids already sleeping?
D we have to wait here.
I'm Chinese.
Tom wasn't very active.
We cleaned the road from the snow yesterday.

Give you a move, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited for a hour and a half.
I'm not good in matematics.

I don't like your head.
I can't be happy when Tom's so sad.
I want to share this with you.
