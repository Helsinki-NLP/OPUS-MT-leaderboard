I don't drink alcohol.
Looks like there's no output ways.
We slept.
I was very disappointed by him.
Why should we do you?
I've been running the plan.
He made a list.
For a little while, I was really out of Coca-Cola, and I drink it every day.
I think Tom's turning us back.
Africa is exporting from the sea to Europe.
He told Tom why he wants to go to Boston?
Tom and Mary are gone now.
More we're, better it's.
She helped us.
She asked advice to her teacher.
He made him a fear of the devil.
What are these things?
I need it.
Is his dog a German shepherd?
We're able to fix anything.
You're gonna buy a gift to your girlfriend.
I went to the beach with Tom and his friends.
Good luck for the test!
You don't even like fish.
Will you come with them?
Tom finally went away.
I don't want to get close to them.
I'm sure the time will be good tomorrow.
I usually don't close the eye of night.
I want to stay home and read a book.
I want you to like Tom.
We don't want him to go.
I'll be very engaged next month.
Because of the disaster, the air department was two hours late.
Sami's reading that book.
The employees are all recorded to a syndicate.
I don't care about the tasks.
Tom is diplomatic, right?
What does he say?
This website uses cookies.
You don't want to stop them?
You can't do this to me!
What did you buy me?
You don't have to go.
I read your book, it's very interesting.
Here!
What are they doing here?
I tried to call him.
Are you traveling often?
My car is German.
I'm so happy that Christmas is here.
I just have to rest a little.
He said she wasn't convinced.
I'm completely satisfied with my new house.
Why English study every day?
I would like to cross the United States with a decappotable.
You won't find her there.
Your explanation is too astrate for me.
Monaco lives inside the monastery.
I just have to find him.
Can I see this?
It is able to speak Japanese.
I could have a mistake.
You're afraid to sleep, right?
Tom will find a job quickly enough.
Correct the underlined words.
Did you tell him you're crazy?
You can watch.
When the results are made public, I'll tell you.
I wanted to go back to his village.
Tom is satisfied with his success.
You're reliable.
I didn't even consider it.
It's better to have friends in the market than money in the box.
You can just smoke on the terrace.
I agree with a hundred percent.
Â· flowers besides being good; they have also a good profumo.
It's at the university now, right?
We should call him.
It's interesting how it happened.
You should remember it.
Tom said he likes to teach French.
He took a currency out of his bag.
Are you stuck with her?
Who breaks this window?
I'm going to tell them.
If you heard it French, you'd switch it to a French.
There's ten minutes later.
We waited for it yesterday.
Tom said Mary was low.
Where's the output?
If I remember right, Tom sold his car to Mary for $500.
I'll call you after dinner.
We didn't agree about anything!
It's very improbable.
No doctor can explain it.
I have to try it.
You're depressed.
You're losing my time.
You're not Mary's husband?
It was all your imagination.
I'm not going to vote!
Why couldn't you do that?
Tom didn't save anything for the pension.
Tom never crys against us.
Lalita called.
I thought you were hating.
I was in my bed room.
They died.
You met someone.
Tom wanted me to visit Mary.
I'm going to work at bicycles.
I'm proud of being Italian.
Who's coming?
I want to see you now.
I think we should call them.

I'm Tom's girlfriend.
Do you like the new Halloween costume of Mary?
He discovered the secret.
I don't give you any ideas.
What is your favorite video game?
Sami's hands are perfect.
Kyoto is an extraordinary city.
I can't accept this gift.
He'll stay our secret.
It's gonna happen soon.

Let him stay home if he wants!
I lived here for ten years.
I'd be happy to give you a guard.
He tried to get up soon.
I like blue.
They have many different fish to try.
What is the difference between true diamants and imitations?
Can you call me later?
I would like two copies of each of these documents.
I hope I'll have to do it for Tom.
What about the new teacher?
If actions are stronger than words, why is the pen more powerful than the sword?
She bought a tea service.
We'll all die.
Tom continued to cry.
I can't do it yet.
George was out of his wrath!
You've fucked me.
Are you ready to learn?
Poor are also people with feelings.
I'm sure Tom's just trying to do it.
You have such a good smoke.
I forgot everything about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm disregarded.
I know a good Italian restaurant.
We can't let him die.
For what I know, Tom's in pension.
What time do you get out of here?
I drink so much milk.
With a smile, whatever is possible.
I like black and strong coffee.
He says no one's interested in something like that.
Tom works for a halt.
I had three options.
Tom and Mary will not be happy to see you here.
These goats are very friendly.
The two sisters seem so hard to distinguish them.
Why don't the koalas have a hobby?
Leave a message, please.
When was the last time you connected to the Internet?
I sounded with Tony yesterday.
We can't let this happen.
The lad entered a wrapped window.
How do you say "I love you" in your tongue?
Start.
You look really crazy, are you okay?
Tom forgot the milk.
That song sounds my family.
Does he have a bit of shit?
I'm bringing some food to Tom.
I want to see a little dance.
I don't want to eat now.
You don't want to eat?
I know everyone you're white.
I'm studying at school.
What would Jesus do?
He says he hates studying the beer.
D we must be heavy and supported.
His catalogue is unreadable.
You let me finish my phrase.
I don't understand the policy.
Have you ever read a French book?
I'm not your angel anymore.
It's been in an injection.
The girl's kid and horses.
Your brother's married, right?
You think Tom's gone in?
Don't give me that.
Now, touch you.
You were confused.
You don't have to do it without permission.
I like his romance.
Who wrote the Bible?
You'll be ready.
We don't drink.
I came back from school, then I went out with my friends.
I came to the station this morning.
This makes me look fat?
It's going to become all economic.
He's not our son.
Osteoporosis suffers.
You can tell her I said that.
I thought you wanted to divorce.
Look what the moon is!
Tom isn't very healthy.
Now give me your hands.
I've cryed.
Mary pi's also the bananas.
I'm a wedding.
I want to meet them.
Tom's going to the trade center.
Tom wants a lot of family.
Do you like it?
I'd have to stay with her.
We'll be friends forever.
I never stole anything.
Tom tried to ignore Mary.
I came home last night.
We ended the benzine in the middle of the wilderness.
Don't worry, I'll come home healthy and safe.
Ask Tom if he will participate in the meeting.
I can't handle a company, it's too difficult for me.
You're learning French?
Is he your son?
Tom never asked why.
He was often lifted up to late.
I don't eat the bananas often.
Get them out of here.
I've never seen them wearing their heads.
You know Tom?
He had a book in his hand.
Give me a poison, please.
Who found her?
What did he say exactly?
You have to go to the hospital.
Tom wanted us to attack.
I'm sorry you've moved into this.
Tom did it for his family.
I prefer summer at winter.
I don't want to humble her.
Tom went to Boston with a friend.
I started a new blog. I'll do my best to be not one of those people who write much at the beginning and then stop writing.
Call me if something changes.
Tom bought the same photo car that Mary had.
The two qualitys are excluded with each other.
No one of the boys took attention to Mary.

Water is cold today.
He's putting the radio.
February is over.
I want to talk to you outside.
What did Tom want to talk to Mary about?
I wasn't impressed.
It's nothing for me.
Tom's feeling better than Mary.
I really like what I do.
I'm scared.
It'll miss all of us.
Tom started reading.

It's not long.
We're depressed.
I never smoke a cigarette in my life.
He's just taking one.
I hate to say it, but Tom's right.
I've already given him your number.
Show me another hour.
Do you want to stop her?
She should have seen her running.
He and I were in the same field at the time.
Tom doesn't know how much you love Mary.
I think I'm objective.
Tom hasn't hit his car yet.
I'll be happy with you.
How long will it stay?
This is intolerable.
I thank you for invited me to the party.
You found the very interesting book.
You should buy a new car now.
I'll never ask Tom anymore.
You're not rich.
Tom called during your deficiency.
Do you want me to teach you some word?
We'll send him home.
Bring me a piece of gesso.
Many museums are closed on Monday.
Don't be disappointed, Tom.

What are you doing tomorrow?
He was talking alone.
A lot of $10,000?
You're taking me away.
I really want to impress them.
What caused the accident?
Have you ever been in a foreign country?
He knows I've been drinking too much.
I wrote him to ask why.
It doesn't have much time.
You're going to go up with the nearby chapters.
He didn't even touch it.
It's very strange, isn't it?
You need to study more.
You'll have seventeen years next year.
You're learning quickly.
You have to save him.
Tom put Mary's car.
Who's your favorite superhero?
Tom's gone in the vacation.
I couldn't sleep.

Why don't we have enough food for everyone?
It seemed to be lucky.
I want to be with the snow.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
You know what Tom did?
Tom's not too long.
What are you gonna say to them?
I know the French.
I think he's a man.
I'm proud of you.

Did you do it already?
Did you ask Tom?

The test was very difficult.
Take care of it, the ground is ridiculous.
I wanted to be him.
Try hopping as high as possible.
We arose on the blue to avoid the ingorgs.
Burk's a choice.
I'm reading a book.

I won't buy one.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I cut my finger with a ball.

I'm coming home at 2:30.
Is she still angry?
This plan is far from being perfect, but it's the best plan we have.
I didn't do anything!
You don't understand.
I'll tell you more.
I'll call her.

Did you know Tom and Mary are good at golf?
Who are you to decide?
Why don't the police arrest Tom?
She's taking her.

Why were you so scared?
Tom and Mary cried out.
I don't even have a job.

What is the best way to travel?
Tom lives with you?

Go to the supermarket once a week.
Can I marry my grandmother's grandmother?
I believe it.

Are the kids already sleeping?
D we have to wait here.
I'm Chinese.
Tom wasn't very active.
